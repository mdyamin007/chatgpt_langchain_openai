Complete description for job type e:

After everything in a doc has been printed


See BFCULS1
  IF &JOB_TYPE=='e' ;
  THEN ;
    BILLING_DATE_NO_DASH = CHANGE(BILLING_DATE,'-', '') ;
    GROUPINDEX ACT_NUM = ACCOUNT_NUMBER ;(can have leading zeros)
    GROUPINDEX MEM_NUM = MEMBER_NUMBER ;(can have leading zeros)
    GROUPINDEX STMT_DATE = BILLING_DATE ;(can have dash)
    GROUPINDEX PDF_FILE_NAME = 'BFCU_Mortgage_'!ACCOUNT_NUMBER!'_'!
     MEMBER_NUMBER!'_'!BILLING_DATE_NO_DASH!'.pdf' ;(not sure if it is ok to have leading zeros in account no and member no)
  ENDIF ;



Group Index must be created for job_type e
the candidates for group index are:
member_number
account_name( client name or addr1)
account_pages(ttl_pages)
starting_date( may be billing date if starting_date is confused)
ending_date( may be due_date if ending_date is not mentioned explicitly)
account_sequence( $seq_num starting from 1)
account_numbers
pdf_file_name( basically from the SOW an example is <member_number>_<seq_num>.pdf)
 and finally we need to call end group
