Complete description for job type f:

After everything in a doc has been printed

Not sure if group index is needed for that
But we need to declare and produce afp for that afp
and also generate index file that is pipe_delimited and contain 13 fields
of which 6 fields is compulsory and other is not until mentioned


2 types of writerecord for this 1 is ppe delimited another is fixed field


Pick any example for that such as BFCULS1(for fixed field writerecord) 
First you will need to define the output individual AFPs.
  IF &JOB_TYPE=='f' ;
  THEN ;
    STMT_DATE_TMP = CHANGE(BILLING_DATE,'-', '') ;
    IF $SYSTEM=='Windows' ;
    THEN ;
      OUTTEMP1 = 'c:\isis\afpds300\'!&PREFIX!'_'!STMT_DATE_TMP!'_'!
       NUMPICTURE(ACCT_NUM,'#0')!'_'!&SEQ_NUM!'_'!&SEG_NUM!'.afp' ;
    ELSE ;
      OUTTEMP1 = '/'!&D_DIR!'/'!&CID!'/'!&PREFIX!'-indiv/'!&PREFIX!
       '_'!STMT_DATE_TMP!'_'!NUMPICTURE(ACCT_NUM,'#0')!'_'!&SEQ_NUM!
       '_'!&SEG_NUM!'.afp' ;(no dash in date,no leading zeros in account no, no space in seq_no)
    ENDIF ;
    DUMMY = CHANGEENV('OUTFILENAME',OUTTEMP1) ;
    SELECTOUTPUT OUTFILENAME;
  ENDIF ;

  SEG_NUM will comes from environment
 
  ENDGROUP ;
  IF &JOB_TYPE=='f' ;
  THEN ;
    WRITERECORD  TO ZIPFILE ;
      PUT &PREFIX!'_'!STMT_DATE_TMP!'_'!NUMPICTURE(ACCT_NUM,'#0')!'_'!
         &SEQ_NUM!'_'!&SEG_NUM!'.afp'  START 1; (no dash in date, nospace in seq_num,no leading zeros in acct_num)
      PUT NUMPICTURE(ACCT_NUM,'#0')!'|'  START *;(no leading zeros )
      PUT BILLING_DATE!'|'  START *;(no dash)
      PUT DUE_DATE!'|'  START *;(no dash)
      PUT &TTL_PAGES!'|'  START *;
      PUT ADDR[1]!'|'  START *;
      PUT '|'  START *;
      PUT '|'  START *;
      PUT '|'  START *;
      PUT '|'  START *;
      PUT '|'  START *;
      PUT '|'  START *;
      PUT  ''  START *;
    ENDIO;
    CLOSE OUTFILENAME;
  ENDIF ; 
  
1.       Create a condition for &JOB_TYPE == ‘f’ before you end your document. Make sure you have already called ‘End Group’.

2.       Write the index file to ‘ZIPFILE’. Your name for the writerecord can be anything. Delimiter is | (see example below).

3.       The first value is the same as the file name you defined in step 4 above.

4.       The 2nd value is the account number

5.       The 3rd value is the beginning date.

6.       The 4th value is the ending date.

7.       The 5th value is the image count.

8.       The 6th value is the name.

9.       All other values are optional. I don’t think you need anything else right now.
