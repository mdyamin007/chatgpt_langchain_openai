title: Format Once - Eliminate multiple format step to reduce processing time
description: At format step, embed FORMDEF and graphic resource information for print, estmt, and archival. Our objective is to have one print module and adapt Timitoo Rewriter solution to apply resources to each of the product output accordingly.

comment: # Ernest and Terrence are working closely with Markus to resolve print step functional requirement.
 # Next Markus will do a demo to demonstrate how their product can output AFP print file for printing, individual AFP for estatement, and PDF for archival.
 # After, InforImage will need incorporate Timitoo-rewriter into our processing infrastructure in order to do a complete parallel test and study the benchmark information. Here, we will need to acquire a test license from Timitoo and have the software installed.
 # Allocate resource (programmer) for training
 # If everything above are executed with satisfaction, we can then negotiate and proceed with purchasing contract.
