title: Check number visible in the 1st line in some letters
description: In the mapping provided to me I read:
{quote}When there is multiple pages for this notice we will see "ACCOUNT NBR CHECK NBR AMOUNT" (these need to be suppressed all subsequent headers except for the last one which will be placed at the top of the transactions).
{quote}
In the exported project, document #1 (you can see the account # below) has 2 pages, yet the first line has CHECK NBR:

comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com], actually I am not sure I understand the requirement for the first line.

This is expected.  That check number was from data file.

Here was the snapshot of one multiple page account in data file.
The verbiage "CONTINUED" meant this account had multiple post card data.
The header line "ACCOUNT NBR" in yellow was not displayed.
The header line "ACCOUNT NBR" in red was the last one and it was displayed.
