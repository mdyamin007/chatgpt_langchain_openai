comment: [~eric.yan]
There aren't any new resources as the data file is a pdf. This just needs to be verified when the e-notice index file is ready

Confirmation is still needed from the AC is still needed for the letter names and has it's own bug tracking ticket:
[BT-68] Additional descriptions are needed. See below in "Description" - Jira (infoimageinc.com)

Currently, the SOW says that 307: PermanentCredit, 317: ProvisionalCreditCreditCard, 318: MerchantIssuedCreditCreditCard, 319: CreditCardPermanentCredit.
