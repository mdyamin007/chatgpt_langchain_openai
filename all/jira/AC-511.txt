comment: Update the due date tosince client will move this project to October.

See client's update today:

"Our credit card conversion was moved from April to October and will happen at the same time as our core conversion.

I assume we'll still need to go through the same process. The file that was put out there is no longer there.

Perhaps we should touch base with Phoebe who is our PM on this conversion.

Thanks!

Kathy"

comment: Per Phoebe, thisprogramming should be 'cancelled' and and the work order should be billable based on the work already completed even though we will not be releasing the change.. See below (comment #61 TS#26909).



"Dawn, as mentioned in my comment #55, based on the original request for this programming update, the code release would have been needed if the CU wanted to move forward with discontinuing the VISA statements prior to the core conversion. I believe that the programming should be 'cancelled' based on Kathy's confirmation, and the work order should be billable based on the work already completed (programming hours), even though we will not be releasing the change.

"

Comment #55" But Kathy is correct, there is no programming update/change that needs to happen any longer to split out VISA statements from monthly statements.

10/1 production cycle will be run "as is" with Mo and VISA statements combined.

As of 11/1 production cycle, the new program that Keri is working on will REPLACE the existing monthly statements based on the core conversion."
