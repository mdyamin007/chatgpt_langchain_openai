Is there any update on the print samples?

Is it paper side only?


author: william.kong
comment: [~kdishroon]: Live date is 12/31 and because we are not done with QA yet, I don't believe live date will be achievable. Based on reading the description, it like we are adding new letters. If so, this job will require parallel run as well. Because next week is year end, we will need to coordinate with OPS to see when they fit in parallel so that we can decide on a revised live date.



If there any questions or concerns, please alert me or [~yameelee]before 12pm PST today. Peter is still OOO.

1. Is there any update on the print samples? for both letters

2. Is it paper side only?

3. please attach an updated SOW


author: tohiduli
comment: Hi [~berezinez]

2. Yes, the update is for paper side only.


author: william.kong
comment: [~berezinez]: Please advise status on when you can anticipate the completion of the QA.



[~kdishroon]: This project is past due, 12/31. Can we target the 3rd week of Jan since we need to run parallel? Maybe 1/18/2022? Please advise so that we can set proper expectation on live date and the resourcing scheduling.

Can you please check-inEWBBDL020.prj andEWBBDL021.prj? Instead of just copy files. For best practice, please use the prj files from your local ISIS directory (DO NOT USE 0 BYTES PROJECT FILES).

Please send message to me when ready to release again.
