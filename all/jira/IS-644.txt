Hi Keri,

Attached the sample ALCU_retirement_stmt_sample1.pdf


author: kericapote
comment: [~rukmaniR] ALCU says:

* There are some statements that have a second page. Do you want this 
to print on the back side or go to a second sheet of paper? We would 
want to print on the 2nd page not at the back.

* For those that have a second page did you want the logo to print on 
the top left as well? Typically if it prints on the back side there is 
no logo but if it prints on a second page sometimes credit unions want 
it. We would want all pages to have a logo on the top left. But your 
sample was showing that the logo as too high, can this be adjusted to 
lower it down a little bit. Please see attached sample.

* Also, for masking we mask to the last 4 digits but what if the full 
account number is 4 digits or less? There is an account 26. How should 
that mask? If account is only 4 digit, please mask the first 2 digits 
of the account number. If account number is more than 4, then mask the 
first 4 digits of the account number.[^ALCU Correction on the Logo for IRA Statements.docx]


author: kericapote
comment: [~rukmaniR] to clarify:

the masking starts from the left to right so it is the last numbers that 
are not masked. We asking InfoImage to mask all by the last 4 numbers. 
Example if acct number is less then 10 digits lets say the account is 3 
digits then it would look like XXXXXXX123. If account is 2 digit then it 
would be XXXXXXXX23.


author: JIRAUSER11100
comment: [~kericapote]

Thanks for the clarification! Can we assume that the account number will not be more than 10 digits?


author: JIRAUSER11100
comment: [~kericapote] [~ratnam]

Timeline shows that the 2nd sample is due on 31st and it's a holiday.


author: ratnam
comment: Hi Rukhmani and Keri, CU confirmedmaximum length of the account # is 10.Transaction description max length should be 60. The transaction amount field needs to accommodate one billion dollar. 



Thanks

comment: [~kericapote] [~ratnam]

Thanks! Since today is half day and tomorrow is holiday, is there any change in the timeline?


author: kericapote
comment: [~rukmaniR] the sample is due to the customer Monday so 1/3 is good.


author: JIRAUSER11100
comment: [~kericapote] [~ratnam]

I've made the changes. I see the 2 and 3 digit IRA plan numbers only in the cross reference file, not in the data file. If they send the data file with 2 or 3 digit account number, we can test it.


author: kericapote
comment: [~rukmaniR] will you be providing a sample today?


author: JIRAUSER11100
comment: [~kericapote] yes, I'll do it today. If the customer can send the data file with 2 or 3 digit IRA plan number, I can test it too.


author: JIRAUSER11100
comment: [~kericapote] [~ratnam] Attached ALCU_retirement_stmt_sample2.txt
As I mentioned earlier, I couldn't test for masking 2 or 3 digit IRA Plan Number since the date file doesn't have any. I've lowered the position of logo. Also, if there are 2 or more pages it'll be printed on another sheet not on the back.


author: kericapote
comment: [~rukmaniR] sample approved 1/4 (as I mentioned on our phone call but wanted to put it here as well).

I've attached the ALCU_annual_retirement_invalid_mail_address_121621_1.csv
As we discussed earlier, there was no invalid address in the data file the customer sent. I've modified one account with dummy address and have created this report.

Thanks!


author: ratnam
comment: Hi Rukmani, could you please correct the headers, Include member number, app type as noted in SOW in Invalid Address Report?



Add the following message at the beginning of this report:



The following is a report that contains all the addresses that we extracted from your data files that USPS classifies as non-mailable.



Report Header: Member Number,AppType,Name,Addr1,Addr2,Addr3,Addr4,Addr5

I've already made the changes for the SSN and statement date switch. Once Ratna confirms the SOW I'll reprocess and send you the index file. Ratna, please confirm the password for the  pdf archival zip file. 


author: ratnam
comment: Hi Rukmani and Keri, I provided the last updated PDF Archival specifications to CU to review again. They were reviewing sample with incorrect SOW specification. I will let you know if we need to make any update at all and also add password. We cannot make changes and provide another sample until they confirm updated specifications.



Thanks

Ratna


author: JIRAUSER11100
comment: [~ratnam] [~kericapote]

Thanks for the update. Should I ask Peter for the password? I couldn't find it in the SOW.

Thanks!


author: ratnam
comment: Hi Rukmani, CU has approved the *PDF Specification* that we send the samples for as they were referring old spec. You don't need to make any changes except they requested the zip to be password protected. This is done for few other client applications and you may want to check with Peter on this. Please review SOW PDF Archival specification one more time to be sure we are good with it and let me know once you create samples with password protected zip. You will need to provide password once you create the sample for CU review. I will review the file before it is placed in client pick up.



Thanks for the help!

comment: Thanks Rukmani, the index file looks good. Please copy the password protected zip sample to client pick up folder and let me know when its ready.



Thanks

Ratna


author: ratnam
comment: Hi Keri, PDF Arch is not approved yet. Rukmani is working on samples to create password protected zip file. CU only approved specifications that I sent for review as they didn't have updated SOW. I just reviewed the index file and requested Rukmani to place in client pick folder.



Thanks

Ratna


author: ratnam
comment: Hi Keri, Rukmani mentioned return address is required. Currently logo *do not* include return address. I checked SOW and I see your comment custom#10 envelope. So custom#10 envelope with InfoImamge's Return Mail PO Box on it correct? Please confirm to Rukmani.



 !image-2022-01-13-20-52-02-339.png|width=438,height=142!

I checked the Return Mail SOW (IS-216) and looks like all their existing applications use InfoImage Return Mail PO Box.

Thanks

Ratna


author: ratnam
comment: Hi Rukmani, please review below feedback from CU. I am not sure how the zip was password protected as I couldn't review. They only want the zip file password protected and not the individual files.

Looks like the anchor doesn't work.

ifPosition of "Federal regulations require that we report fair market value of IRAs" is the page anchor. and its missing the program should stop and an error message should display in the message list "an anchor is missing"


author: JIRAUSER11100
comment: [~berezinez] Address and the IRA plan number are used as the anchor. I'll have to add another error message if it is missing.

[~ratnam] We can't use statement date as the anchor because it is in all the pages and is the same. Can you please update the mapping document?

Did you code for*+Suppressions+*: Hold All Mail or Hold Mail ?

** I seeDo Not Mail only.

Per SOW :

*+Special Handling/Suppressions+*: If Do Not Mail, Hold All Mail or Hold Mail occurs in address block, suppress from print. Include in pdf archival and eStatement (eStatement is phase 2)

comment: [~kericapote] [~phoebe.george] [~rukmaniR]

Keri - Per SOW - the endorsement should be on printed DOC,

but it already appeared on envelope 5306.

The Endorsement should be printed OR on a printed letter OR on the envelope.

Next time please check on it before requesting printed samples, because now we should wait for the third set of correct samples.

Please advise where the Endorsement should be?, and request a new set of samples, and update the SOW. !endorsement on printed doc and on env.GIF!

Per Sow -

author: JIRAUSER11100

 # Where should the endorsement appear? on the envelope? or on the print samples?

  **** it's already on the envelope 5306

if it's on the envelope, you should update the SOW, and request a new print sample without an endorsement. It's never on the envelope and on the printed documents.



Please advise...Please ask [~phoebe.george]if you need help.

author: kericapote

I didn't get the answer, where did the endorsement should appear?




author: berezinez
comment: [~kericapote] [~phoebe.george] [~Igor.Khosid]

Have you seen the printed samples?

if the endorsement

*On Outer Envelope*  Requires a custom preprinted outer envelope

Please request print samples without endorsement on it.

[~rukmaniR]please provide a new DPVS without an endorsement and with IMB on it.

one time we received print samples without IMB,

the second time we received print samples with an endorsement.
