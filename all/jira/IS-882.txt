Here was the assessment of account bill pdf.

We can extract anchor and recipient address lines.

I attached a sample output from Redtitan where we masked out address lines.

I make up program to generate several accounts having invalid addresses.
Attached invalid address report.
 [^CAIG_accountbills_invalid_mail_address_07192022_2.csv] 

Also attached DPVS that showed 7 accounts went to 5mis.
 [^caigls1219.print] 

We don't need to print this DPVS.  Just a reference to show the mis file.
