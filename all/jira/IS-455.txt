I am wondering if the logo should be updated on the backer as well? >>> see below

author: jira_naru
comment: Igor:

The new logo is just an image with no address. So, we are updating the image and not the address. The address should be the same as production.

So you are seeing the new logo on both the front and the backer.

comment: Hi Nar,

Can you please provide a DPVS as well? The client wants physical print samples.

Here is the client's feedback:
 In instances where our logo is represented at sizes of a width of 1.24" or less, please use our logo with larger sized "Credit Union" subheading, attached here: [^WCU_HORIZ_LOGO_CMYK_FINAL_K.tif]


author: jira_naru
comment: Keri:

The latest Logo[^WCU_HORIZ_LOGO_CMYK_FINAL_K.tif], is too big for the daily letters. Please advise.
