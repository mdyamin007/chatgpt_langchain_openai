title: BKPL Monthly Statement Backer Update
description: BKPL Monthly Statement Backer Update

The very last sentence on the backer currently reads, Please refer to BankPlus Schedule of Fees for research fees. The bank needs to add the following sentence below that sentence:

This Electronic Funds transfer notice is applicable to only Consumer accounts.

It will be OK to take out one or two of the Check No. lines above in order to gain the extra lines for the needed sentence.

Here is the sample[^BKPLMS21.pdf]. Ignore the all missing check images. This is generated from my local machine that's why no check images. Just see the verbiage addition.

For this simple update, I guess we can ignore the dpvs or index file . It's just adding a line and we are not using any new fonts here that can create issues while printing or on isd side, let me know.
