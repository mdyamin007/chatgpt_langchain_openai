comment: Hi [~phoebe.george],

So, I ran my script to transfer statements for the first 100 accounts on pilot as I want to have the client confirm if everything is working as intended before I do the whole list on pilot. I have provided 3 log files which the client can look at.
 # *debug.log*
 ## It provides a break down of what is happening during the migration process. It's mostly useful internally, but the client may find it useful.
 # *account.log*
 ## It provides a break down of what ultimately happened to the accounts that were being transferred.
 ## It provides information on what account was able to successfully transfer statements, accounts that didn't exist, and accounts that were created in order to have statements transferred over.
 ## The client should focus mostly on this file!
 # *test.log*
 ## These are some of the accounts that were created during the migration. I found these accounts from the account.log.
 ## The client should login with these accounts. They need confirm that they can SSO with these accounts, go through the enrollment steps, and see if the statements shows up.

comment: [~mac] Thanks for the info. SSCU validated on pilot and all looks good. However, they wanted to confirm for these two account numbers if they should be seeing eStatements posted for them in pilot. I know pilot site does not have all eStatement cycles posted, so wanted to verify if they just didn't have any estmts, or if tied to a different reason:

100197470

53942

They were pulled from the account.log report.

Thanks,

Phoebe

Hi Phoebe, I'm not fully understanding the question. So, is the two accounts not suppose to see statements. I see statements from them on pilot.

comment: [~mac] Oh got it, the CU is logging in through online banking SSO (test environment). Their member site only displays 36 months, so these statements from 2018 are not visible from how they are accessing. I'll sen them these screenshots so they can review in Admin Pilot and confirm if approved.



Thanks!

comment: [~mac] As discussed, I received confirmation that pilot site is approved. Please prepare for QA and provide any background they need in order to QA.

[~Igor.Khosid] [~nprimak] FYI, this is a one time update for migrating historic eStatements from one account # to another. SSCU tested/validated and approved on pilot.

comment: Documenting production release steps with SSCU:
 * Our developer will run 10 records in production.
 * Once completed, I will forward to you both to validate/spot-check in production  this will allow you to see the full history tied to production for the surviving member number.
 * Once you have validated, please let me know.
 * Our developer will then run the full list in production.
 * The CU will then validate any other accounts from the listing in production from the full list.

[~mac] As discussed, SSCU has validated the subset of accounts in production and provided their approvals to move forward with running the full production file. 

They will validate in production as well once completed.

Thanks again for your help!
