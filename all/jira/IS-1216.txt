title: KYCU - StmtPDFi Conversion to AFP2PDF Python [InHse]
description: Update existing processing script to no longer use PDFi tool to create pdf.
 Instead use afp2pdf.py program with index_build_multicore option for ALL statement related apps.
 The smaller daily notice jobs can use the current index_build options.

All the zip file, pgp encryption, index file contents, and PDF file naming convention must remain exactly the same original specifications.

Please ensure the standard SOP on the directory structure must be followed: 
 ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/pdf, ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/zip, ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/work is followed.
 Also, clear the folder directory folder before each processing. We do NOT want to accumulate previous runs.

The current program should support checking total PDF counts verification to make sure the expected pdf matches the total number for pdfs generated; If not, incorporate this standard verification logic

comment: [~mahbubS]: Sorry to do this! But I do need a copy of the production file so I can compare accurately. Can you re-run the job with cycle 6/30/2022? I backed up a copy of the production file. I will update the description now to reference 6/30 instead of 5/31.

[~Igor.Khosid]: This program runs on RHS2. I ran pdf_compare.pl. Since there were no completed PDFi projects this morning, I increased the number of documents to check from 6000 to 15,000 document. pdf_compare.pl did NOT report a single difference.

Please wait for [~mahbubS]to submit to QA. In the meantime, here are the testing results:

Please start qa on this.

Project is in qa folder: /d/iss/qa/KYCU/KYCUMS11.zip

Parallel id:20220721115655

Paper and estatement sample is given using 2nd segment data and archival sample is given using segment 1. The 1st segment is big and 2nd segment is small data. *The prime purpose is to qa archival*. As the data file is big, so i ran the paper and estatemt using 2nd segment to save time.
