comment: [~premraj.patil] and [~kent.chan]: Tien reported while testing, the script complained about ssh connection issue from the cp_to_texas.sh script.  This program handles copying print files over to Texas. Please advise if you can open port 22 connection to Texas.



Please advise how you would like me to update the Brisbane server list if needed.

comment: [~kent.chan]:  Per our discuss during today's Brisbane meeting. You will need to work with Ferhat to get this working. But in the meantime, i will need to find a way to work around not copying afp files over to Texas for testing until Ferhat comes back with a permanent solution.
