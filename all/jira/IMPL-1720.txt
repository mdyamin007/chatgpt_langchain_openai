comment: Why is the Electronic due date so different from Print? We can't do anything without Print composing the statements.

comment: Sorry Tai. Those are just for filler for now. I'm waiting for a sample date from IS. Once I have, I'll update with new dates.

FFIN has no expectation on timeline.

What are the letter codes and descriptions for this?

comment: FYI - This is on HOLD while FFIN is researching the following issue.
 # Can you send the data file as a .CSV (instead of an excel file)?Yes
 # *For the co-applicant part, is it possible for you to add a co-applicant indicator field ? For example, you can name this field Has Co-applicant and enter Y or N.*
 # Regarding the credit bureau; will these always be Transunion or will we be programming to handle all 3 bureaus ?This will always be TransUnion.

comment: [~enricob] [~rodriguez]- Attached is a new sample file for the Adverse Action notices in csv format. The file also contains one new field on each record (added at the end) to indicate when a coborrower is present:[^csv1634329108050_details.csv]

Hi guys, file looks ok to me except for one thing, I do not see an account number. If these are going to be posted to e-statement we will need an account number. Also account number needs to lead off with 1 or 6 to derive the app code/type.

comment: FFIN confirmed no eNotices for this particular letter. SOW has been updated.

Sounds good. This file format will work. Can we possibly get a file with more records for testing ? This one only has two lines of data.

Thanks,
