title: ca-rtitan-pr-01:  Missing D:\ and share folder
description: Currenlty the ca-ritan-pr-01 (10.4.20.222) server is missing the D:\ partition. I believe this is because we don't have Isilon Server to setup a 2TB D:\ Partition.



+*Temporary Solution:*+

I temporarily created a folder:

C:\brisbane_temp\D  [Share Name is "D"]

C:\brisbane_temp\K  [Share Name is "K"]



+*Permanent Solution when Isilon Server is Up:*+

*!image-2020-08-12-22-01-47-013.png!*
 * Unshare the names above "D" & "K" from the c:\brisbane_temp\ folder
 * Create a D:\ Partition w/ 2TB storage.
 * Right click the D:\ partition and create a share name "D". Add local user rh1login. Give Full Control access permission for the rh1login and Everyone user: !image-2020-08-12-22-01-23-234.png!


 * Under D:\ partition, create a folder "K". Right click D:\K folder and create a Share name "K". Add local user rh1login. Give Full Control access permission for the rh1login and Everyone user:
 * !image-2020-08-12-22-04-17-518.png!

comment: why are we creating these partitions on isilon when we're moving the server over? These VM's for redtitan for just for your testing
