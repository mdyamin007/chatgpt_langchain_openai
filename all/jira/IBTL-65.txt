CFCU MV1 was failed to process in Brisbane rhs2 (10.4.20.40)



- cfcumv1_process.sh is callingcfcu_ecl.pl to create ECL files.

- The process is failed to access "/z/isd_input/I3" incfcu_ecl.pl.

comment: [~TunA]: Thanks for reporting this issue. It is a known issue where isd_input server is not available yet. I'm going to see if I can help ISD get this configured for them to expedite our testing process. Once done, I will re-assign this ticket to you.

comment: Hi Will,

Adding extra status.

- After comments out "cfcu_ecl.pl" script, the process failed in message manager.

- After comments out "message manager" flags in control file, the process failed in file scanner.

- After comments out "infotrac" flags, the process completed. But the e-stmt afp files cannot be created in /z/isd_input_dev/ file. (cp: cannot create regular file `/z/isd_input_dev/indiv_afp/cfcu/afp-archive/cfcumv3-08122020/': No such file or directory)

Thanks

comment: [~TunA]: Please retest the ECL program and re-enable infotrac flags. The /z/isd_input_dev directory is working. I finally am able to mount to ISD isd_input dev server.

comment: Hi Will,

The ECL script stage is OK now. But we still have issue file scanner stage.

The process failed with "Error: /home/test/master/chk_file_id.pl missing file_size".

If we get this error, normally we need to rescan the file in infoftps folder (In this case, /z/infoftps4/jha/cfcu/cfcu081220.vis.zip.pgp).

But the file is not pick up from that folder.

Please advise.

Thanks,

Tun

comment: [~TunA]: Thanks Tun for confirm that the ECL is working. The internal ftp scanner is a known issue not being available yet and notated in the Known Global Issues. I will assign this ticket to me for now until all issues are resolved and re-tested.



Thanks!

comment: Hi Will, Just to be clear. We cannot turn on infotrac flags in control file if internal ftp scanner is not working, I think you asked me to re-enable infotrac flags for testing.

Thanks!

comment: [~TunA]: Can you restore the control files and retest this in RHS2 {color:#de350b}*parallel**environment*{color}before Friday?

comment: Hi Will,



After I restored infotrac flag in control file, I got following file scanner error again in (rhs2:10.4.20.40) and process stopped.

The files scanner does not pickup files from either/z/infoftps4/jha/cfcu/ or/d/infoftps4/jha/cfcu/

Please advise.

Thanks,

Tun

comment: [~TunA]: Can you confirm if you copied the data file into /z/infoftp_int/JHA/cfcu folder to ensure the file was scanned and in the database? Unfortunately I cannot find the /cfcu083120.stm.zip.pgp and cfcu081220.vis.zip.pgp to verify.



Please advise.




author: tuna
comment: Thanks, Will! Seems like/z/infoftp_int/JHA/cfcu is worked for scanning.

I will keep update the status.
