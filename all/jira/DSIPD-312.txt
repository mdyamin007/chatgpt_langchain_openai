comment: I've been facing some issues in DR-VM03 (10.4.18.43 ). I see there's docker installed , but the docker daemon/service isn't running.
(systemctl status docker) command returning it's not active.

Also it couldn't be able to connect ubuntu host to update ubuntu package manager (apt/apt-get update)

comment: From the list I can see that logstash, ConextualSearch and infoscanner should be on DR-VM01 (10.4.18.41), but in smartsheet I'm seeing it's under DR-VM07(10.4.18.47). Can you please clarify me where should I put which services?
