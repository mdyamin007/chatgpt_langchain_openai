comment: [~anil.dasa] - On print side the job is processed successfully & its also been processed by the Index FIle Processor.Can you please check why its (proc id 2268837) not visible on Bris Prod InfoTrac?

We have 42 pages on job status table. Job 2268837 has file received date as 08/15. So I had to search with dt_job_id for viewing job.

comment: Thanks [~anil.dasa] - I can see the job listed.



[~cesarg] [~William.Kong]- Also please note that the afp files did not get copied to /d/isd_share/frst/afpfiles hence InfoTrac is unable to open pdf via JobStaus.


author: william.kong
comment: [~Peter.Dang]: Can you see the message above to see why afp files did not copy over to /d/isd_share? Is there any way we can manually recover?

comment: New online proofing has this code. Not sure if this was intended, but it will not copy the afp if processing_proof='y'



[~William.Kong]



if [ $call_for_processing_proof = "Y" ]
 then
 # new online proofing update
 new_online_proofing_create_copy_prf_pdf_to_isd "${base_dir}/${cid}/${baseAfpFile}"

else
 echo -e "$baseAfpFile.${dateTime}" >> ${isd_share_fileid_folder}${fileid_idx}
 vcp ${base_dir}/${cid}/${baseAfpFile} ${isd_share_afp_folder}${baseAfpFile}.${dateTime}
 if [ $? != 0 ]; then
 echo -e "Error in vcp ${base_dir}/${cid}/${baseAfpFile} ${isd_share_afp_folder}${baseAfpFile}.${dateTime}"
 echo -e "Error in vcp ${base_dir}/${cid}/${baseAfpFile} ${isd_share_afp_folder}${baseAfpFile}.${dateTime}" >> ${fn}.log

comment: [~shailendrar]: Can you help me verify if Peter's assessment is correct and review the implementation of the new_online_proofing_create_copy_prf_pdf_to_isd function to see why the afp files are not copied over?


author: shailendrar
comment: [~William.Kong] - I don't think so as Menlo has the exact same code & afps are getting copied over. I'll need to spend more time research.


author: shailendrar
comment: [~Peter.Dang]- If the job has proof file set to 'Y' the track_by_rec() function is called twice:
 * From isisdisk script (For regular afp files)
 * From olp_handler.sh (For proof file)

Before calling track_by_rec for regular afp files the processing_proof is always set to "N"; see below code snipped from isisdisk_daily:

#new online proofing update

2990 if [ $checkfile = "${fn}.prf" -a -s $checkfile ]
 2991 then
 2992
 2993 # set a flag to indicate we are calling for proof file not full file
 2994 call_for_processing_proof="Y"
 2995
 2996 new_online_proofing_process "$checkfile"
 2997
 2998 # set call_for_processing_proof="N" after finished
 2999 call_for_processing_proof="N"
 3000
 3001 fi

so the issue is not related to processing_proof flag;FRSTME3 has no afp copying issue when ran on Menlo server.

Also one of the other job (EWBBDNA) has a proof file & it did not have any issues copying afp's over (https://jira.infoimageinc.com/browse/IBTL-163).

comment: It is strange, the afp file all of sudden appears. The process was Oct, 29. We may need DP to retest if time permits.



VCP log indicated it was copied successfully.

comment: [~cesarg]: Scratch that! I don't want this re-testing to impact OPS testing. Please disregard!!

comment: [~cesarg]: Pleaser re-test. Our print & inserting test is completed. I just want to make sure the issue above is resolved.

comment: Shail,



Look like the prf.pdf file was copied over instead of afp file. Please check the code below.



#if called for processing then convert the prf afp to pdf
 if [ $call_for_processing_proof = "Y" ]
 then
 # new online proofing update
 {color:#FF0000}new_online_proofing_create_copy_prf_pdf_to_isd "${AfpFile}"{color}

else
 echo -e "$baseAfpFile.${dateTime}" >> ${isd_share_fileid_folder}${fileid_idx}
 echo "---^^^---vcp ${AfpFile} ${isd_share_afp_folder}${baseAfpFile}.${dateTime}" >> ${fn}.log
 vcp ${AfpFile} ${isd_share_afp_folder}${baseAfpFile}.${dateTime}
 if [ $? != 0 ]; then
 echo -e "Error in vcp ${AfpFile} ${isd_share_afp_folder}${baseAfpFile}.${dateTime}"
 echo -e "Error in vcp ${AfpFile} ${isd_share_afp_folder}${baseAfpFile}.${dateTime}" >> ${fn}.log
 fi
 fi

comment: Also notice in this function notice the vcp afp to isd_share does not have timestamp.



new_online_proofing_create_copy_prf_pdf_to_isd() {

echo "$0 starting copying prf pdf to isd..."

local AfpFile="$1"
 local baseAfpFile=`basename $AfpFile`
 #need to create prf pdf for online proofing
 local prf_pdf_name="${baseAfpFile%afp}pdf"
 echo -e "${prf_pdf_name}.${dateTime}" >> ${isd_share_fileid_folder}${fileid_idx}

{color:#ff0000}vcp ${AfpFile} ${isd_share_afp_folder}{color}
 if [ $? != 0 ]; then
 echo -e "Error in vcp ${AfpFile} ${isd_share_afp_folder}"
 echo -e "Error in vcp ${AfpFile} ${isd_share_afp_folder}" >> ${fn}.log
 fi





I compared production and BB logs and found that production does not copy pdf file over.

All the files are copied as expected. Are you saying the code on Brisbane server is different than current production?
