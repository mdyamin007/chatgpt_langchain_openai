comment: Dave, this is done, except I did not open port 992. What is this port for?

comment: Kent,



I forgot to add the ca-ftpbu-pr-01 (10.4.20.35). Can you help open the ports for this one as well. You can ignore 992 for now.

comment: BTW, I try the telnet command on ca-pui-pr-01 and 02 but do not have any luck with any of the port.  Can you help double check.

Trying 10.4.10.17...
telnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection timed out

comment: Can you guy confirm if the DNS has been created for secure3? I found this (ca-s3ftp-pr-01)on the sheet but it is not setup when I do nslookup.

ca-s4ftp-pr-01, andca-s5ftp-pr-01 seem to work.

Thanks
