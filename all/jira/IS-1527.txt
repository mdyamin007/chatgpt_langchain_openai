title: EWBB - Stmt - Hong Kong PDFi Conversion to AFP2PDF Python [InHse]
description: Update existing processing script to no longer use PDFi tool to create pdf.
 Instead use afp2pdf.py program with index_build_multicore option for ALL statement related apps.
 The smaller daily notice jobs can use the current index_build options.

All the zip file, pgp encryption, index file contents, and PDF file naming convention must remain exactly the same original specifications.

Please ensure the standard SOP on the directory structure must be followed: 
 ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/pdf, ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/zip, ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/work is followed.
 Also, clear the folder directory folder before each processing. We do NOT want to accumulate previous runs.

The current program should support checking total PDF counts verification to make sure the expected pdf matches the total number for pdfs generated; If not, incorporate this standard verification logic

DT_JOB_ID:

Processing Scripts to modify:
 /home/master/isis.sh (option 130)

Data Files to use:



*NOTE*: This job runs on RH2. Since we are migrating from RHS to RH2, we should test all options so that we can do afpcompare and also ensure there is no errors in the processing logs.



*Additional Note:*

If it is easier, we should move away from isis.sh to create a standard ewbbms4_process.sh script. However if it is quicker to update isis.sh instead to support AfP2PDF.py, then that is ok.

comment: [~anwarh]: As you are aware, we discovered this app needed PDFi conversion as well. Can you assign resource when time permits?

comment: Hi [~William.Kong],

Parallel ID: 20221025163103
production cycle: 10/18

Data files:
/z/dsi_pdfi_testing/ewbbms4/data/EWBB_HK_SRS007801_10-18-22.txt.pgp

Only thing you can compare is these two files
/z/isd_input/indiv_afp/ewbb/afp-archive/ewbbms4-07292022/ewbbms4_10182022_1001601066060_0.pdf
/d/isd_input/indiv_afp/ewbb/afp-archive/ewbbms4-10182022/ewbbms4_10182022_1001601066060_0.pdf

Notes: 
* This doesn't have any archival, it uses pdf to post to estatement.

Thanks,
Anwar

comment: Hi [~William.Kong] , not sure about this, afp shows it correctly. The issue occurs in afp2pdf. I've not found any afp2pdf parameter that can fix this. My guess this image inside the overlay is scaling. But it's scaling in two different ways in two systems.

I can try recreating the image and the overlay to see if that fixes this.

Thanks

comment: [~anwarh]: Do you have an update on re-creating the image? Please advise.


author: william.kong
comment: Hi[~anwarh], please don't forget to provide me a status update on getting the image replaced so that we can re-test and get this project completed this week.

comment: Hi [~William.Kong], is this work?  [^ewbbms4_10182022_1001601066060_0.pdf] 


author: william.kong
comment: [~anwarh]: The heading on the newer version is tiny bit bigger but acceptable. However, could you adjust the footer so that the Chinese characters are the same size as production. The newer version is bigger and noticeable since is it not aligned with the sentence vertically. Please compare with the production version to see what I'm seeing. This should be the last item to address and we can finally get this project to QA.

comment: [~William.Kong], Please check now. I think Papyrus messes up position and scale if the placeholder of that image is larger than the image itself.

comment: [~anwarh]: For some strange reason, I'm not able to download? It's erroring out on my browser. Can you please it in your folder so that I can review?


author: anwarh
comment: seems like I also can't download it. The pdf file always generates in this location: /z/isd_input/indiv_afp/ewbb/afp-archive/ewbbms4-07292022/ewbbms4_10182022_1001601066060_0.pdf

comment: [~anwarh]: Thanks! This looks much better!



[~Igor.Khosid]/[~Andrey.Kutsenko]: On Monday, please review. There is only one 1 document for this cycle. This application does not generate a lot of docs at all. The files are in:

ca-unittest-pr-02:/d/pdf_compare/ewbbms4_prod/

ca-unittest-pr-02:/d/pdf_compare/ewbbms4_parallel/


author: william.kong
comment: [~Andrey.Kutsenko]: Would you be able to find time to review this particular QA request. There is only one document to QA and should be quick. We have 3 more projects to complete Phase I including this one. We are targeting to wrap up Phase I of this project next week before Thanksgiving so that we can shutdown RH2 server.

comment: QA is completed.
The document on parallel looks clearer.
