title: MFCU - [31778][pvt][in-house] Daily Letter #18.01 - Exception Error on Prisma
description: *UPDATE 8/24/22:* Per ticket #31757, comment 22, MFCU has requested to use branch code 3 TIFF for 7. They want to HOLD the change of not using a TIFF if a branch code is not recognized. This will revisited at a later time.



-We need to make a hot fix to not pull any tiff image when there is no tiff associated with the branch code. The branch code 7 is missing a tiff resource. Below is a list of branch code in the program. Can we double check if these are all the expected branch code for this letter? It looks like we have a tiff image for these branch code in production. We would need a Jira ticket to update the format program to not use any tiff if the branch code is not in this table. Please create Jira to make the fix.-
