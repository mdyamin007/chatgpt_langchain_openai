I have deployed in Pilot.



Previously shows the account number in batch download.

Now shows the account *description* (nickname) in batch download from the USR_ACCT_TYPE_MAPPING table instead of account number. If any account description isnt assigned to an account then show the account number.

For more clarification, I added screenshots.

Thanks!

Client can use this URL to do SSO: [https://washpilot.infoimageinc.com/]

The client can do the SSO using the net-teller vendor:
 * *VENDOR_USER_ID*: 44ac2919e4ac4d75f0777c5274aaad41



Thanks

Now needs to search Statements according to account description and statement types. So for that need to add _date range, select accounts, and select account types_ then click on the *search* button. Here I added the informations andmarked its as red color.
NB: Account# Select All or Statement types# Select All are not mandatory. You can select one or more.

Client is asking:

Do you know if this change will go into effect for our consumers as well? Our businesses use our on line banking platform from Bottomline and our consumers use Net Teller.


author: JIRAUSER11002
comment: Hi [~Bryanl] ,

Yes this change will affect both businesses and consumers as this wasn't applied based on user types or sso types.

Thanks!

comment: To QA

I have deployed my changes on stage.

Previously the site used to show account number in batch download, now it will show the accountdescription(nickname) in batch download instead of the account number. If any account description isnt assigned to an account number then it will show the account number.

I described details previously step by step: https://jira.infoimageinc.com/browse/ISD-7402?focusedCommentId=45261&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-45261

QA can use the following credential for testing:

net-teller VENDOR_USER_ID:97d08488563400e5571a3a70b45dcfa8
