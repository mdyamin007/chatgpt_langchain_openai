comment: [~kdishroon] This will be assigned to DSI. This new pilot will be 4/8. Please attach the Logo, font, colors scheme, and the eStatement disclosure with the new logo for the update. The personalization document doesn't have much that we can use for this project as most of the items are same as the current setup.



[~rifat.mahmud] [~mamunur.rashid] Please review the personalization document, especially item 7 and confirm if the verbiage is currently in place.

comment: [~kdishroon], [~Tin.Chak],

I have a few questions/feedback regarding this rebranding
 # They are going to take two new features contextual search and pop-up alert,right? So which types of pop-alert will they show? i.e undeliverable email , unviewed documents
 # For #7 on the personalization document, they currently do not have any verbiage there, but it is doable with toolTip, it will be visible on both enrollment step#3 and profile page. !Screenshot_20220324-172512_Meet.jpg|thumbnail!!Screenshot_20220324-172905_Meet.jpg|thumbnail!
 # as Sean already saidPlease attach the Logo, font, colors scheme, and the eStatement disclosure with the new logo for the update. Cause without them I do not have anything to work with.

Thanks,

Abdullah

Please see attached eStatement disclosure with the new logo [^E-Statement Agreement Update 3.29.22.pdf]
 # Please provide the eStatement disclosure with the new logo. {color:#de350b}Please see attached.{color}
 # For the two new features, contextual search and pop-up alert, which types of pop-alert do you want to show? i.e undeliverable email , unviewed documents, etc. {color:#de350b}These are the standard options but they also have the ability to customize the pop up message, correct?{color}
 # For #7 on the personalization document (attached for reference), you currently do not have any verbiage there but it is possible with toolTip; it will be visible on both enrollment step#3 and profile page.{color:#de350b}Can you confirm where on the profile page it will be displayed? They currently have language like this on the profile page  see below. In addition, can you please add the language shown below that we currently have on the profile page to enrollment step#3?

comment: Hi [~kdishroon],

Still pending items are:
 # new sample.pdf

Other than this all the thing that can be done on my end is done, once i have the sample pdf i can pass that to initial QA and then on to pilot.

As per your previous comment,

1. Noted.

2. yes, I was asking for QA purpose like which features should be tested by the initial level of QA. so I will add the as standard and test. As per customized messages, Yes for undeliverable email they can show a custom message.

3. Their message can be shown exactly where it is right now. I was giving another option where they can show this message as well. !Screenshot_20220324-172905_Meet.jpg!

comment: Hey [~kdishroon],

Apart from the Sample.pdf (which is pending from your side), everything is ready for the hypercube side for the pilot.

Do you want to proceed to pilot on the 8th without sample.pdf so the client can review it?

Thanks,

HFCU is deployed on the pilot. HFCU is ready for the client to be reviewed.

I have turned on Contextual Search & Pop Up Alert for them as well.
 # The contextual Search file is not ready on IS side, so we will be able to see a new search field on the statement page but it won't show any statements if they search with a keyword.
 # Pop up alert is turned on InfoTrac site admin can configure them.

We have another round of testing on the pilot. from our testing UI element's color code matched with the file provided. but if the client has any confusion/concern regarding any specific item let me know so we are on the same page.

comment: Hi [~abdullah.baki],

This is the client's feedback on the eSite:
 # *I noticed the orange of our logo and the orange of the buttons/bars are different. Has there been any alteration to the colors? Are we using our brand orange on the buttons/bars?* - Can you match the buttons closer to the color of the logo?
 # *White text on orange buttons does not pass website accessibility standards. Are we able to change that to black text on the orange background?*



Regarding the pop-up alerts:

*Our team has reviewed the pop up alerts and we have provided feedback and a few clarifying questions below.*
 * *ENotice  we would like to select all of these except for the Closed Account Letters which infoIMAGE no longer sends out on our behalf. Looking at the sample notice below if the member has more than one unopened notice type it would all be listed on the one popup which is good.*
 * *ETax  We dont believe HFS currently uses ETax so we can skip this item*
 * *eStatement  we would like to select this.*
 * *Undelivered emails  Can InfoIMAGE confirm that we are able to use this pop up with our current system setup and settings? and if so can we modify the language? If the answer is yes to both of these questions, then we feel this would be a good one to also add.*

*Also, can InfoIMAGE confirm if the verbiage can be changed on any or all of these pop up alerts?*

Are we using our brand orange on the buttons/bars?*-{color:#172b4d} Can you match the buttons closer to the color of the logo? Yes these two orange looks different. this might be because we had to convert the .tiff logo file to .jpg , can the client provide logo in jpg format so that we can check if both color are the same or not?{color}{color}
 # {color:#de350b}White text on orange buttons does not pass website accessibility standards.

comment: Hi [~kdishroon],

Abdullah was able to use the logo on the site. He was out sick for the past 2 days. He will join us tomorrow and will match the color with the logo and make the other changes that they've requested. He will put everything on pilot tomorrow.

Thanks,
Rifat 


author: abdullah.baki
comment: hi [~kdishroon],

All the changes are on pilot now, please make sure to clear the cache.

Let me know if there's any mismatch. still, if there's a mismatch between logo and color, we will need a specific color code from the client.



Thanks,

comment: Hi [~abdullah.baki],

Here is the client's feedback:

*We have reviewed these screenshots with our Marketing team. The eSite looks great.*

*May we request one more very small change? Please change the color of the various links throughout the site (exe-statement agreement, [www.hfsfcu.org|http://www.hfsfcu.org/]) from the color red to the color orange to match our button colors.*

Can they be reloaded, it looks like the color message is not showing because the campaign has a different date. I have created a new campaign with the statement date that was loaded so hopefully that will fix the issue.
