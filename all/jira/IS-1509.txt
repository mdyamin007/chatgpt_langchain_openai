I used the data file "wash_dda_08192022.zip" for testing and there is total of 1111 accounts in this file that would get the insert.

Here is dpvs:[^washds1119.print]

File:washds11194.2o1

Range: 1-22

parallel id:20220826095538

project:qa\WASH\WASHDS11.zip

The minor code are added to these two variables "D_MINOR_CODE_INS_SET='01,02,03,04,10,17,19,33,34'" and "S_MINOR_CODE_INS_SET='20, 21'". Whichever minor code should get a insert will go into this variable. The logic is that it will check if the major code 'D' or 'S' and have a "*_MINOR_CODE_INS_SET" with the minor code in this set then it will get an insert in bin 2.

comment: Hi [~Natalie.Tom] [~Igor.Khosid]

I spoke with both Igor and Daphne/Jessica regarding this and we will have a one time approval process setup for client to approve as print samples dont show selective insert. I have let client know, thanks!
