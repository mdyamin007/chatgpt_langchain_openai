comment: [~kdishroon], can you provide me the enotice descriptions for each letter? It looks like we sort of have them already but I want to confirm exactly how they should be casing/spacing wise on the site.

Thanks,
Shun

Btw, do we have a new due date for this project as well as their enotice setup, JEF 47330?

As per Thomas comments, see IS-244, reverting status to "In Progress"

"There is a separate JEF47330 for enotice setup that is on hold currently. We can hold off on checking enotices until that project is resumed."

comment: [~kdishroon], it sounds like this project is still on track to release while we need to hold off on JEF 47330, is that correct? I would still need to release my portion for JEF 47330 if that's the case, which I can still do on time but I just need confirmation.

comment: Hi Shun,

I am pending Will's confirmation on when IS can release code. As soon as I hear back from him, I will let you know.

Thanks!

comment: Hi [~kdishroon],
Per our spark, I've released the following enotice codes/descriptions to production:

024 - 05 Day OD Letter
025 - 07 Day OD Letter
026 - 15 Day OD Letter
027 - 30 Day OD Letter
028 - 35 Day OD Letter
029 - 38 Day OD Letter
030 - 45 Day OD Letter

I've also released only the general enotice functionality on production as part of JEF 47330 so that we can post, won't be releasing the enotice descriptions for JEF 47330 until later.
