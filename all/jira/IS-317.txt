comment: [~dawnl]: Please advise if we will be receiving approvals today. Nar will be OOO from Friday and will return Wednesday. We also need time to run parallel. Live date of 9/28/2021 may not be achievable. Please advise.



[~TunA]: FYI: The project file should have data inside the project zip file. Nar has not run this at all in parallel since it is pending approval.

Subject: RE: [**External**] PAMD - New Sutter logo for letters #21000

Hi Dawn,
They are thinking about another change to the letter address. I will get back to you once decision is made.

Thank you for understanding,

~Best,
Sharda




author: william.kong
comment: [~dawnl]: Please advise what the changes are so that we can re-quote the estimate and re-schedule the timeline for this project based on our next availability.






author: william.kong
comment: [~dawnl]: Any updates on the re-work client wants to propose? I'm hoping it is minor so that we can quickly quote the job and fit it in. If not, and it requires a lot of re-work, then this project may have to be pushed out further early next year. Please advise if we can get an updated this week so that we can assess the efforts for the additional programming work and to see if we can fit this change into this year. The quicker we get the feedback the sooner will see if we can fit this into our scheduling.

comment: Here is client's response on 10/6: "I am still waiting to hear from my management regarding the image change. Once I hear from them, I will let you know."

I have reached out to client for update on 10/14 and again on 10/19.



author: william.kong
comment: [~dawnl]: I'm going to put this on hold since we've been waiting for client to provided revised specs in order to determine the amount of extra coding efforts and revised timeline.


author: william.kong
comment: [~dawnl]: I don't believe client still has responded. [~jira_naru]may not be able to do any coding until February of next year. Please ask client if they are needing this update on or before 11/30. If not, most likely we need to resume this project possibly in Feb/March. If they need to resume this project, we need the feedback no later than Monday morning and evaluate the extra programming hours to see if we can fit this in.



We will not reserve any time slots until we get commitments when they want to go live.



I want to make sure we communicate this expectation so that client is not surprised that we cannot accept any work during Dec/Jan timeframe.


author: william.kong
comment: [~dawnl] : We cannot resume this project until February or later; no knowing what the feedback effort is from client.. Please advise client to still reach out to you to plan when to resume this project so that we can plan ahead during the code freeze for when on or after February to resume. Please do not wait to February to reach out, otherwise this project will delay further more.



{color:#de350b}*If there is no response by Jan 31, 2022, we will ask that this project closed out and billed.*{color}


author: dawnl
comment: I have discussed with Jessica,   we will close and bill this project due to no response from client  for sample approval since 10/14/2021.


author: william.kong
comment: Thank you!



[~jira_naru]: I will update your ticket to be voided. [~dawnl]/[~Jessica]will bill client for the effort you've spent on this project. Thanks!
