The client had provided new templates (attached); can you update and provide new samples? 

Thank-you,

Keri


author: william.kong
comment: [~thomasY]: Per our conversation you are going to review the template and see when you can provide updated samples.



[~kdishroon]: The live date is currently set for 9/16 (today). Is the client expecting us to go live today. If so, please let me know ASAP.


author: kdishroon
comment: No, they are not, please provide a new timeline.


author: thomasy
comment: [~kdishroon]Those pdf files you attached do not look like templates? Regardless, the data is print image so I do not know what I'm expected to do with those pdfs. Is there new data with these new verbiages?


author: kdishroon
comment: My apologies Thomas, please see data files attached.


author: william.kong
comment: Hi [~kdishroon],

[~thomasY]will need to review it this week. Can we for now mark the new live date to be 9/30/2021 since this Jira ticket is past due (i.e. 9/16/2021). This project will require parallel and I estimating roughly by 9/30/2021 or earlier. Please advise if you agree.

author: william.kong
comment: [~kdishroon]: Also, please confirm my comment above regard revised timelines? We need to get this updated on the ticket as well. Since [~thomasY]just provided the revised samples, can we get final approvals by Thursday so that we can submit to QA on Friday, go parallel and target 9/30/2021 live date.



If these dates don't work, please let us know what client is suggesting to see if we can fit it into the our scheduling.

comment: [~kdishroon]: Looks like we are starting parallel today. Do you think parallel can be completed by 2pm PST/4pm CST? If not, there is a high probably we may not be able to release the code today and will require your assistance to hold production tomorrow if we+must+ run the new notices tomorrow morning.



Please advise.
