comment: [~barnetts] It depends whether there are resource updates needed.
[~eric.yan] are there any resource updates we need to do on ISD's end? If not then I think we can close this ISD story.

comment: [~barnetts] This change was an IS update only, I don't recall needing to upload any resources on my side.
[~eric.yan] Can you take a look? Below are the index files which those two accounts are in:
visa index: mv1_04152022_04182022_1122_ofcu.txt
heloc index: me1_03312022_04012022_1101_ofcu.txt

There's a resource I didn't provide to ISD to upload. It's uploaded in parallel now. Could you ask DP to rerun the latest me1 job in parallel and let me know when it's finished so that I could verify the update? After confirmation, I'll release the update to production.
