title: MFCU - Update to DMV Dealer Letter (100) - verbiage/MFCU - Letter 123 Business Analysis Statement - change to paper only; needed by 2/28
description: Requesting changes to be live by 2/28/22.
 There are 4 changes to the letter 100:

First paragraph - remove the sentence: Our records show that we have not received the Certificate of Title for the vehicle listed above.
 Third paragraph - change the last sentence to: We appreciate your prompt attention and cooperation in assisting with completion of the DMV paperwork.
 Remove the whole paragraph on "VEHICLE CODE SECTION 4456a".
 Update the document number to: DMV-DL-02/22
 Template attached.

Letter 123:
 Is it possible to make this notice print and mail but at the same time post to the eportal for member online access?
 Would you please change the setting for letter 123, Business Analysis Statement, to paper only?

Some organizations do not have access to online banking so they cannot view enotices. This change will need to be implemented by 2/28.

Thank you.
