comment: Rifat, this is the ticket I'm talking about. Please work on this and provide screenshot on pilot. This should be in "ssoExchangeErrorMessage". If the CIF doesn't existed when the user logs in, it will display the message.

comment: [~mamunur.rashid] There is one update to the 'Error' screenshot - can you change the word 'Error' to: 'Oops, something went wrong' verbiage? They wanted that at top in bold/larger font in place of the existing 'Error' verbiage.

The second screenshot with the email contact verbiage has one update to capitalize the 'S' in Secure. It should read: Email us through Secure Message

Thanks!

Here are the updated screenshots:

*ssoExchangeErrorMessage:*

The bold and largeword 'Error' is by default in hypercube for every client. It will be a global change if we want to replace the word 'Error' with 'Oops! something went wrong'. Should I do the global change?



*Updated Contact Info:*

comment: [~mamunur.rashid] One more fix that they caught! Please add an apostrophe to 'were' so that it displays as: we're

The screenshot of ssoExchangeMessage is not the final one. I have just created it by hard coding in hypercube. I need some confirmation about it.

comment: [~mamunur.rashid] Sorry, I can't have the error header changed globally.

Can you change back the 'error' header right away, and note the Oops, something went wrong similar to your original screenshot. But please bold and enlarge the font for Oops, something went wrong by 2 additional font sizes? Just so it stands out under the Error header. Please still add the apostrophe for the we're sorry.

Please provide new screenshot this morning so we can ensure this gets approved and deployed before the code freeze.

[~Tin.Chak] FYI in case DSi is OOO by now.

Here is another one with a little bit small font size of "Oops, something went wrong". Let me know which one is better.

comment: [~mamunur.rashid] The updated screenshot is approved based on your last comment for the Error message, thank you!

For the email line on the site page, can you change S in 'secure' back to lowercase, sorry about that! they had requested the change in error, it should still be this based on your ORIGINAL screenshot. This is approved with this final change. Thank you!

comment: [~mamunur.rashid] Sean let me know that this update would be released today - can you confirm what time?

Also, just wanted to make sure you saw my last comment - the customer approved the error message, and the 'email' verbiage, with the update to change the 's' back to lowercase. Just want to make sure that update was done before the release. Thanks!

[~Tin.Chak] FYI
