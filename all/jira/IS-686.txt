I updated the program to use primary account number to search for matches from "IDCU_CML_XREF_111821.csv" for e-suppression. However, there was no match for e-suppression match using the test file. Can customer confirm if there should be any match from this test file "CML_LN_BLXTR_111821.7z.gpg"? If there is none, do they want to send a new test file that should have matches? Attached is a list of the primary account numbers from the data file "CML_LN_BLXTR_111821.xml".

Are we okay to proceed with update? Or will customer be sending a new test file? Per last comment, the current test doesn't show any e-suppression for print because the primary account # in data file have no match. We can only verify e-stmt and archival still work as expected with"CML_LN_BLXTR_111821.7z.gpg".

comment: [~jun], sorry, I took over IDCU and this slipped off my radar. I forwarded them the sample and your question about the sample. I will let you know what they respond with.

Thanks

comment: [~jun], IDCU dropped a new test file in the test folder. Can you try again?

CML_LN_BLXTR_021822.7z.gpg

Thanks!

There is still no matches of primary account number fromIDCU_CML_XREF_021822.csv to the primary account number inCML_LN_BLXTR_021822.xml. Can customer provide a couple primary account numbers from this test file should match for e-suppression?


author: dyuen
comment: [~jun], I reached out to IDCU for some examples. Pending response.


author: dyuen
comment: [~jun], IDCU updated with the following:

We need rework and validate the code behind the CML Xref file. E-Suppression needs to be based on the <Account AcctNbr> in the data file and the delivery method specified at the account-level, not the <PrimaryAcctNbr> in the data file. The delivery method specified on the Primary Account Number isnt necessarily how the Commercial Loan bill should be processed.

Thanks

comment: [~dyuen]: This project is past due and we will need to revisit timeline for this project while they revisit their logic fix based on your comment above.


author: dyuen
comment: [~jun], this is the client's following response:

The Primary Account Number isnt unique in the LN_BLXTR file and, therefore, wont be unique in the CML Xref file if this is the field that is to be used to identify the delivery preference.

The account number located in the <Account AcctNbr="708732211" MLAcctNbr="" CombAcctNbr=""> tag is unique. This is the account number in the test CML Xref file.

Please let me know if the programmer still wants us to proceed with updating the Xref file with the non-unique primary account number.

[~William.Kong], IDCU is aware that the timeline has been pushed back. Based on the latest response and Jun's feedback, please provide a new timeline ASAP.

comment: Hi [~jun], IDCU sent another file for testing.

"Everything looked good on the original file!



I just dropped one more test file to the FTP TEST folder:

  CML_LN_BLXTR_031522.7z.gpg.



This file contains two of our "problem" loans and we want to validate the changes with this specific member/loans. "



Can you process a new sample from this test file?

Thanks
