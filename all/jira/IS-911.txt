comment: Samples provided via FTP on 3/7. Client approval due by 3/9.

comment: Anwar, can you provide ISD the index on ISD-6613 so they can post on pilot for eNotices? 


author: andreav
comment: See client feedback below and provide new samples:

Can we ask that you suppress the cents of the credit limit variable in the top right hand corner and in the body of the letter?  It should always be .00 in the file.

We would like to make a change to the callout lines in the top right of the letter and instead of having those lines above the date be left justified, we would like them centered as it appears on the new templates I have attached below.

I corrected the templates also (attached) to have the correct document numbers in the lower right hand corner.  Our previous templates had them reversed.

We don't necessarily need you to provide the whole file of accounts that we provided.  If it is easier, you can just provide us with a sampling of both letters.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks.
