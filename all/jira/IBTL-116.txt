title: infoftp_int parallel folder set does not match current
description: [~William.Kong] I was going to push an ISBK data file through the infoftp_int parallel scanner to Brisbane server, yet it does not look like the corresponding file is set up. I decided to compare the current infoftp_int folder set against the Brisbane folder set and there appear to be a number of folders missing:

CURRENT:

BRISBANE:

comment: [~glenn.grimes]: Thanks for reporting this observation. I only synced it once. But now, I added it to the schedule to sync once a day between Menlo to Brisbane to create the missing folders.



I'm going to close this ticket out for now.
