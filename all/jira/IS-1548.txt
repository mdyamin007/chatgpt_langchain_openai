The second point says to show any - (minus) related values within () brackets. Does that suppose to mean whenever we find a negative amount we need to change it with () brackets?

comment: [~Sheikh_Fahim] im going to give these to the customer but i wanted to mention i see on the last name we are removing a comma in some cases, can we add that back in? for example "THISSTRUSTEE" should be "THISS,TRUSTEE" as it comes in the data.
