This update to add the backer for the EWBB Loan Bills has been made. Please refer to TS#29672 comment #18 for backers to use based on the existing e-forms/preprints. Note that the letter 6090 e-form/preprint does not currently contain a backer, however, per client request they would like to add a backer for e-statement, so for this update I have added the same backer used for letter 6088 for letter 6090. Will need to confirm this with client when samples are provided for review.
 * Exported updated project files to \\download-nas02\qa\EWBB\EWBBLN<###>.zip
 * Requested ISD on ISD-7620 to upload new resources and post the e-stmt index file to pilot
 * Also attaching individual pdf samples, which should reflect what is shown electronically
 ** EWBBLN001 (letter 6088) new statement:[^ewbbln001_new_stmt_sample.pdf]
 ** EWBBLN001 (letter 6088) not new statement:[^ewbbln001_not_new_stmt_sample.pdf]
 ** EWBBLN002 (letter 6090):[^ewbbln002_sample.pdf]

In the output of both lettersEWBBLN001.dfa andEWBBLN002.dfa ,I found not a newstatement backer,

EWBBLN001 (letter 6088) new statement: - also should be there? if so what account has it in data file EWBB_6088_043018.CR.fix ?


author: JIRAUSER10906

Yes, the new statement backer is a possibility only on EWBBLN001 (letter 6088). In data fileEWBB_6088_043018.CR.fix, I have mocked up the data so that the first four accounts are classified as new statements. Example: acct#9173671

Hi Alis, I have made a last minute change to this job, specifically for letter 6090, since a backer should also be added for print (originally only added for e-statement). So, to get this backer to appear for print, the letter 6090 e-form has been modified to include a back page . The backer added is the same as what was approved for e-statement here:[^ewbbln002_sample.pdf]

Please review to make sure the correct backer has been added, and that the e-form is working correctly.

Thanks,
Sam

This update to add the same backer that was approved for letter 6090 e-statement to print has been complete and released to production.

DP does not need to reprocess. Please request production print samples.
