title: CAIG BC Notices HOT FIX
description: The mismatch in the DPVS occurred due to nesting of the CancelNonPayNotice's and the ListBillCancelNonpay Notices.

This is happening to both AG and AH notices:

Example:

File 1: 1317_0-CIG-0-1011347ListBillCancelNonPayNotice_AG.pdf

File 2: 800_0-CIG-0-1193856CancelNonPayNotice_AG.pdf

The substring *C
In previous test files ListBillCancelNonPayNotice_AG.pdf were not present or named differentlyancelNonPayNotice_AG.pdf is present for both file 1 and 2. 


example: 1317_0-CIG-0-1011347ListBillCancelNonPay_AG.pdf

-above word Notice is missing


1) Hot fix I can get done in about 2 hours
