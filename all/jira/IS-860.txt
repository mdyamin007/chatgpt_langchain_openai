title: MFCU - TS26785_26791 Credit Card Post Live Updates
description: -We want to center the statement on the PDFs in eStatements. On print because of the bardcoding on the left margin, the body of the statement is pushed to the right. In eStatements we want the body center on the PDF.- (Not needed, already centered)

In addition, please setup FTP Trigger to automate the process when this file arrives.

*Adding this from TS #26785*
 * Create a customized print module so that first page will pull from second tray if an account comes from noncoupon file.
 * Increase summary box size so the bottom border doesn't cut into the last line in the box.

-*Adding TS27116*-
 -1. In the Summary of Account Activity make two changes:-

-1. Include Balance Transfers on the list of items. Put right underneath Cash Advances.-

-2. Bold Fees Charged and Interest Charged words-

- In the Interest Charge Calculations under Annual Percentage Rate (APR) for each rate include an (a).-

- Under the Interest Charge Calculations section add a footer:-

-(a)= Average Daily Balance Method (including new advances, purchases and fees).-

-Please see the Average Daily Balance and Balance Subject to Interest Charge sections of your Cardholder Agreement for more details.-

- In the Interest Charge Calculations for the rates under Annual Percentage Rate (APR) the rates only need to go to the hundredth position. So it would go from 9.900% to 9.90% [^Credit Card Statment Changes.docx] [^Annual Billing Rights Notice 03 2020.docx]-

-Add inline insert:-
 -Attached is the approved disclosure. I also confirmed we want these to go in eStatements and archive.-
 -Print the disclosure on the first available blank side.-

-If a statement had a page 1 and a page 2 then print as a page 3 on the second sheet of paper-

-If a statement had a page 1 a page 2 and full or partial page 3, then print on page 4 the back of the second sheet of paper.-

Sorry, misread Will's instructions. I am voiding the PR forms. Per ticket 26791, the client has not approved the samples and has requested a correction on spacing in the Summary of Account Activity Box. Le will provide new samples.

author: andreav
comment: Hi Le, please use this new test file for all samples/testing going forward. Once they get back on feedback or approval on the last samples, we will need to run this new file and post on InfoTRAC pilot so they can proof them.

comment: Le, there is another TS 27116. Is this update included in the last set of samples?


author: william.kong
comment: [~andreav]: TS27116 is outside of the scope of work. Please get this quoted and we need schedule this in the next run.

I'm crossing off your description of work as this is outside the scope of the original request.




author: andreav
comment: I already made the request for hours and timeframe on 3/2. I have reminded Peter to provide it.
