QA pass, ready for client approval.


author: andreav
comment: [~rumanb] - Client says samples look good so far but would like additional samples: 

 "Can I ask that you produce samples of 2 actual charge off accounts from last month's production run before I approve?  Account 12111510 and 22213450." 

Please provide the samples.
