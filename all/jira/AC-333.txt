This is similar to many documents we sent out already including the Member Statements (see example below and also refer to APCUMS21.dfa)

This means, moving forward all files will this will be the permanent file naming convention for the daily notices process.

seq # is a 3 digit number to identify the multi-part batch number whenever zip file reaches 10,000 files.

Zip Logic will need to be changed to zip files by 10,000 file each.
