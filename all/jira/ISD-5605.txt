comment: Hi [~phoebe.george], is there any update on these CTFC logo tickets? Since there hasn't been any recent activity on our end (I think maybe one resource update in the past 3 months?), David suggested we close these stories. Please discuss with him if you have any feedback. Thanks!

comment: [~phoebe.george] Fyi, I will be out for the next couple weeks starting tomorrow and will be back on 6/17. We shouldn't need to do anything else besides update the resource file, which should already be done. If parallel passes today then I think I can go ahead and close the related ISD stories myself, if not please let Sean know so he can have someone else take care of it. Thanks
