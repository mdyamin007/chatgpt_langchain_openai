comment: [~phoebe.george] , Per my spark to you on July 26, this application is not set up for estmt yet on our side, though I believe we only need to update the script to take "f" option for estmt process. I am not sure if ISD added this application to their side either. We would need to go through testing for estmt, I did not continue with the paperless option since we have not set up estmt yet. Would need ISD to confirm if they are set up and then we would need to do testing with it. Which is not the one hour quoted. I am not sure if they were ever charged for estmt set up (not sure how the addendum works).
