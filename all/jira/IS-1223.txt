title: VWCU - Stmt - Combined Monthly & VISA PDFi Conversion to AFP2PDF Python [InHse]
description: Update existing processing script to no longer use PDFi tool to create pdf.
 Instead use afp2pdf.py program with index_build_multicore option for ALL statement related apps.
 The smaller daily notice jobs can use the current index_build options.

All the zip file, pgp encryption, index file contents, and PDF file naming convention must remain exactly the same original specifications.

Please ensure the standard SOP on the directory structure must be followed: 
 ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/pdf, ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/zip, ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/work is followed.
 Also, clear the folder directory folder before each processing. We do NOT want to accumulate previous runs.

The current program should support checking total PDF counts verification to make sure the expected pdf matches the total number for pdfs generated; If not, incorporate this standard verification logic

DT_JOB_ID:
 133592-C00.01-V21885

Processing Scripts to modify:
 vwcu_stmt_combine_process.sh

prefix:*vwcums1*

Data Files to use:
 vwcu_combined_053122.zip



*ADDITIONAL NOTE*: This job combines with Visa Statements, so testing of ms1 & mv1 will be required.



*{color:#de350b}ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENT (9/23/2022){color}:*Add the following to vwcums1.control file:

afp2web_version="v4"



*NOTE*: This job runs on RH2. Since we are migrating from RHS to RH2, we should test all options so that we can do afpcompare and also ensure there is no errors in the processing logs.

Data files:
/z/dsi_pdfi_testing/vwcumsb/vwcu_combined_073122.zip

old zips: /z/dsi_pdfi_testing/vwcumsb/old/
new zips: /z/dsi_pdfi_testing/vwcumsb/new/
zip password: 6s1Xe9

Note: It's a combined process with apps containing
ms1
mv1
ma1

[~William.Kong], I had to modify the core module 'isisdisk.sh' because it doesn't pass a 2nd parameter 'LOOKUPFILE2' with our normal archival call (). Previously it did pass it for the 'pdfi' job sel.
Don't think it's going to affect any other apps, still discuss it with Peter. 

Thanks,
Anwar

comment: [~anwarh]: I took a quick look at vwcums1 (Monthly Statement) and noticed there are an issue with the graphics. The AFP2PDF shows a border but PDFi does not. Can you see why there is an extra border line? I'm assuming this graphics is permanent and not part of Message Manager, so if it is a permanent resource, we do need to address this issue:

comment: [~anwarh]: I'm going to let this border issue slide since this is message area 2 and will change month by month. However, I would ask that you add the following to /home/control/vwcums1.control so it will force Message Manager to use the current AFP2WEB server of PP03; This will allow client to see new behavior in future Message Manager approval process:

{{afp2web_version="v4"}}



I will ask Andrey/Igor to proceed with the QA process.



[~Igor.Khosid]/[~Andrey.Kutsenko]: There are 3 application to review. They are all in the following folder:



*ca-isis-pr-04:*

/d/pdf_compare/vwcumv1_prod

/d/pdf_compare/vwcumv1_parallel

/d/pdf_compare/vwcuma1_prod

/d/pdf_compare/vwcuma1_parallel

/d/pdf_compare/vwcums1_prod

/d/pdf_compare/vwcums1_parallel



I attempted to start initial testing so you can review the vwcum*_compare.sh; I completed vwcuma1_compare.sh last night but did not finish QA.
