 [~Shun.Kuwashima] please check ARM notice: Subsequent - 1705922862 (ROBERT P VAN AUKEN)
I see a discrepancy between the document name and the view:

comment: [~Andrey.Kutsenko] Per our call yesterday, this seems to be expected based on the enotice description in the SOW and the data we received. We may want to update the letter description to something else.

[~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] Currently letter code 301 has description "Initial Rate Notice" in our database, however the SOW shows both "Subsequent Rate Notice" and "Initial Rate Notice". Letter codes and descriptions are 1 to 1, we cannot map two different descriptions to the same letter code 301. Since it's one letter code, we have to either combine them (i.e. Subsequent and Initial Rate Notice) or change it to something like ARM notices which Rukmani suggested. Can you advise whether we should update the description for letter 301?

to a NEW one:
*Report Header: "Account Number","AppType","Letter Code","Name","Addr1","Addr2","Addr3","Addr4","Addr5"*
