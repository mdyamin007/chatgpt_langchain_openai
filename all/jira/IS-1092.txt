Please provide :
1. Updated mock-up, as on the TS#19322 - are 168 comments
2. Update SOW
3. Wondering what is the ISD story, sounds like missing


author: igor.khosid
comment: The story received late 05.20.2022 _ 4:17 PM



author: igor.khosid
comment: Thank you, [~Tevis Mak] for uploading - mock-ups 

[~Kbittmann] - pdf sample ready for the client review

1. Provide update SOW
2. Confirm ISD story - not needed

Please see client feedback below:
We are very close. I see a couple of minor things:
 # On the first line, at the beginning of the 2nd sentence, the word should be "I'm" there appears to be an odd character there.
 # The HUD logo is missing from the footer.
 # I don't see that the supplemental pages are included - what we refer to as our 'BRP Package'.
 # I would like LN2302P referenced somewhere. Perhaps under the date? or near your reference CD2161P?


author: yameelee
comment: [~Kbittmann], I assumed the supplemental pages are only for ticket #19324 for LN2302. I was not aware that it is to be included in this notice and did not quote for it. I know it was attached to the ticket with a comment from Peter about setting a call on the 3 notices to be on same page (which I was not yet included in the projects) but it was not mentioned anywhere that it is to be included in this notice.



This will delay the project and it will require more hours. See how ticket #19324 is 25hrs because its including the 13 inserts.


author: yameelee
comment: [~Kbittmann] , FYI, since we will share the same resources for inserts as Sams program, please add another 5hrs to the 8hrs originally quoted.

Sample is attached on TS#19322

Index File:[^banb_afp_enotice_10292021_164950_1.txt]

Note that the page before the BRP inserts will be printed duplex but a blank page will be on the back. This is to mitigate an issue where the BRP inserts start printing on the back of the previous page when it should start on its own sheet.

FYI, [~Igor.Khosid]


author: JIRAUSER10911
comment: [~Tevis Mak]

The client says everything looks good. However, they want to send an updated BRP insert. They haven't attached it yet.


author: JIRAUSER10911
comment: [~Tevis Mak]

Updated BRP attached to Team support ticket 19322. File size is too big to attach to Jira ticket.


author: yameelee
comment: [~Kbittmann], this new BRP will be extra hours as per Sam's comment on his Jira.


author: JIRAUSER10911
comment: [~yameelee] [~Tevis Mak]

Please advise on added hours.


author: yameelee
comment: [~rodriguez], please check with sam after client confirm on his ticket IS-1046 whether it is only 2 pages of BRP that needs to be updated or more and provide how many hours to make the update.


author: JIRAUSER10911
comment: [~Tevis Mak] [~rodriguez]

Yes, only 2 pages will require an update.


author: rodriguez
comment: [~Kbittmann]Updated timeline and hours same as IS-1046. Please update Jira Due Date to reflect new timeline:

Please see below revised timeline and additional programming hours for updating the BRP resources once more:

Programming: 2 additional hours

BT-72 - The error is related to tickets IS-1046[19324] and IS-1092[19322]. It's about SOW.
