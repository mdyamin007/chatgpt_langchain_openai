title: Hypercube - Update "Show entries" Pagination Verbiage 
description: For pagination on the eStatements page, instead of
"Show 10 entries", change to "Show 10 entries per page".

This is to provide more clarity on the fact that it will show up to 10 entries, but there may not necessarily be 10 entries. More inline with most pagination UI on various sites.

In addition, we should make this update for any page with pagination to keep the verbiage consistent: always "Show X entries per page".
