title: 21920 - SPCU - Old name showing
description: Members are seeing the old credit union name on the account dropdown menu on production. Attached screenshot spcu_21920.png from the client.

Old: SF Police Credit Union
New: The Police Credit Union

Notes:
* This looks like production and not pilot, the insert in the screenshot looks to be only active on production.
* Checked all 4 hypercube servers and the name looks correct in the properties.json file.

If there are any updates, please pass them on to Tai.
