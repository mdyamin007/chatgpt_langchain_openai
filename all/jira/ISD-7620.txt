lna_08272022_08292022_1214_ewbb.txt posted on pilot [jobId: 189132].

N.B. The statements are posted under the accounts with type '03'. We have to provide a description on the _DOC_DESC_ table for this type so that they are being displayed on the account select drop-down on client site. What should I set as the description for type '03'? ["Loan" is not available as it is the description for "LN" on the doc_desc table].

[~Tin.Chak]please advise.

Thanks

Azhar

Perhaps "Loan Bill"? This job (ewbblna) is a daily loan.

We may not need to insert any new description on DOC_DESC table yet.

For the accounts on the lna index file, we might be provided with an AUTH/CIF file to create/map users, so that the clients can login to client site and view the new loan statements.

In this cif file, a sub-type will be passed for which we have to have a description on the DOC_DESC table. This sub-type might be "LN" and we currently have the description for "LN" on the DOC_DESC table.

[~Tin.Chak]Let me know, if I am missing anything.

[~rifat.mahmud]fyi.

Thanks,

Azad

I have reviewed the CIF file(csv) that you attached and found that EWBB might use 'HL' as sub-type for this accounts. Also, they are using '03' as the type for those accounts in 'lna' index files. So we will map HL with 03 in our database.

Nevertheless, we still need the description for 'HL' to set on our database so that, the description can be shown on the account selection drop-down on client site. For now, I am setting "*_HELOC Loans (TEST)_*" as a placeholder description. Please see attached screenshot (_EWBB_Heloc_Desc_on_AcctSelector.png_).

Please provide me the appropriate verbiage for Heloc statements and I will set it for client to review.

Thanks,

Azhar

I provided the auth file in .txt format

I couldn't post the auth file as this file has 13 columns. EWBB auth file should have 12 columns separated by tabs and no header. Please see [^EWBB_CIF_062022.txt]as a sample.

The revised CIF file couldn't get posted. EWBB Auth file will contain 12 columns and each column is tab separated. Here are the issues against each column --


||Column||Issues/Note||
|1. BANK (bankNum)|bankNum should be "01". In the CIF file it is "1"|
|2. CIF_KEY (cifNum)|cifNum should be zero(0) padded to make all columns aligned|
|3. CUSTOMER_TYPE (clientType)|Looks fine|
|4. FIRST_NAME (firstName)|Looks fine|
|5. LAST_NAME (lastName)|If no lastName provided, then it should be left empty. Revised CIF file has "NULL"|
|6. APPLICATION (subType)|Provided "HL". Looks fine.|
|7. ACCOUNT_NUMBER (acctNum)|acctNum should be zero(0) padded to make all columns aligned|
|8. DATE_CLOSED (dateClosed)|Closing date should be in MMddyyyy format. Provided in MM/dd/yyyy format|
|9. OPEN_DATE (openDate)|Open date should be in MMddyyyy format.Provided in MM/dd/yyyy format|
|10. ACCOUNT_NAME (acctName)|Looks fine|
|11. PRODUCT_CODE (productType)|If no product code provided, then it should be left empty. Provided "NULL" in the CIF file|
|12. MAINT_CODE (maintCode)|Provided "A". Looks fine.|

Please follow the conventions and take a look at the [sample cif file|https://jira.infoimageinc.com/secure/attachment/29136/EWBB_CIF_062022.txt] for reference.

I couldn't post the revised CIF file. It is not "tab" separated. Instead the data columns are separated with "space".

Take a look at the CIF file posted today for EWBB on Prod PUI, job ref #3508201, file name:EWBB_CIF_091422.txt. Please generate the CIF file the way that CIF file (_EWBB_CIF_091422.txt_) is generated.

The file couldn't be posted. The issue was for column 4(FIRST_NAME) and 10(ACCOUNT_NAME). Each name is consist of 2 words and the words are separated by tabs, instead of space.

Data for each column should be separated by tabs, but the FIRST_NAME or the ACCOUNT_NAME are single column. For example, the name "DAVID GARCIA" is a single data. "DAVID" and "GARCIA" should not be separated by tab. The words should be separated by space.

To sum up,
"DAVID GARCIA" - correct, because not separated by tab, as it is data for a single column.
"DAVID  GARCIA" - not correct, because the words are tab separated.

[~Tin.Chak]Please advise.


Thanks

comment: [~MattL] You mean the CIF file, right? They can just send it normally through the FTP. They can give it another name and have DP post it manually.


author: mattl
comment: Hi [~Tin.Chak] [~Azad]

Due to the delayed parallel the client is requesting that we release with out a completed parallel, I have attached the confirmation to the the Team Support.



Please expedite release.
