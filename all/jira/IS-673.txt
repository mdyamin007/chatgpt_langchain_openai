comment: Hi[~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com],

Attached sample:[^SURU_Upfront_stmt_121921_071315.pdf]
 Note that the amount position in "GT" is inconsistent.

example:
{code:bash}
GT,"01/16/2022","$7,500.00"
GT,"$47,740.00"
{code}
So, if there are two fields, taking the 2nd one, if one, then the first one.

Thanks,
 Anwar
