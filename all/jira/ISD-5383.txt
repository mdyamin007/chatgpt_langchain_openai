comment: [~mac]Hello and welcome to InfoImage! When will you have a sample of the bounceback report for IS to create this letter from? Also IS is asking where the bonceback report will be in production so they can write the program to pick it up and create these letters? Let us know. Thanks!

comment: [~kericapote]Thanks! I have attached a sample here for the bounceback. If you didn't already see, Ethan already commented on Team Support on where the report will be in for production.
