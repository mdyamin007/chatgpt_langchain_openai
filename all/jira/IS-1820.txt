comment: Hi [~barnetts]

So, for the share type 7 i need to print it on the PRIMARY AND SUB SAVINGS ACCOUNT section and for the share type 37 print on the CERTIFICATE ACCOUNTS section?

As currently on the ts35677 your last comment showed the share type 37 is in SAVINGS section but in the code all of those share types are in the CERTIFICATE ACCOUNT section. The below ss shows all the accounts that are currently under CERTIFICATE ACCOUNTS section in the code

PER CLCU,
We don't want these share types to print in either the Savings or Certificate sections. They are both technically Checking accounts. I through we clarified this in a previous discussion. Why can't we simply include them with the other existing Money Markets (Share Types 8, 9, 38, and 39)?

Thanks, Barnett
