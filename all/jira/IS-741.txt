Sure, I will change to 2.

Any other fix I need to do?

comment: [~zhuoxinT] [~gthillaivel]
Please check if you are using the correct template?
 - The very first record, based on the mapping, should be used with template "MB," but it sounds you are using "IP." 


author: igor.khosid
comment: [~zhuoxinT] - Please disregard my last comments >> template is correct


author: igor.khosid
comment: [~andreav]
[~zhuoxinT] - please upload updated project into the QA folder
[~gthillaivel] - please continue mapping testing, we will discuss it today on our QA daily meeting

Month should display as years as per datafile
 [^Initial ARM Notification mapping.pdf] 


author: JIRAUSER11101
comment: [~gthillaivel],

Yes, for template "IP", subsequent sample, it should be months, for "NB", initial sample, it should be years
 I don't see the problem on this. Could you double check that?




author: gthillaivel
comment: [~zhuoxinT]-yes the templates is IP, mapping matches with pdf data
