comment: Hi [~William.Kong]

Normally we do cvs checkin which moves the files to xfer folder say /d/is/cvs/xfer/ronyD, and normally tell the manager ( Peter/Tun) resources are in my xfer folder. But recently we are filling up the transfer form for while submitting new projects or old projects but with lot's of resources. But this is only one dfa.

Do we still need the transfer from here? Is the because if there are resources for multiple tasks/issues in the xfer folder the transfer form will tell which resources for which issues?



Thanks
