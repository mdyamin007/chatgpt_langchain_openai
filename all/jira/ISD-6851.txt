comment: The issue is caused by
sess_login_id = 'inactive_!7682146_07122011 143710'
sess_active_status = 'active'

The SSO key verification is expecting 3 values and space in sess_login_id is causing it to think there are 4 values.

Updated sess_login_id value to '!7682146'.

Found 63 other records with same condition for FNBT and updated sess_login_id.
