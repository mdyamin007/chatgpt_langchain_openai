title: SSCU - [28800] [ptv] eStatement Enrollment File for Core Update via FTP
description: Setup separate file to be sent back to CUs FTP client pickup folder daily with member delivery preference; CU will use to
update their Fiserv DNA core based on existing Fiserv process. Here is the information for the report:
Fiserv has recommended we use their e-Statement Maintenance Application to ingest your file and maintain the enrollment
status on DNA. Below are the required specs for the file. I have also attached the documented specs for your review if there
are any questions. We are utilizing the Delivery Method field on DNA to document the enrollment status.
Update type (D), Account Number, User field value (WWW=enrolled PRNT=unenrolled)
Enrolled in eStatements example:
D,12345,,WWW
Unenrolled from eStatements:
D,12345,,PRNT
