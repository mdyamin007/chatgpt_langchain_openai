Hi Matt, this is ready on pilot.


author: mattl
comment: Hi Mac,


Can you please provide testing instructions for the client?


author: JIRAUSER10913
comment: [~MattL]

Hi Matt,

They just need to send a test file in this format

*necu_enrollment_mmddyyyy_hhmiss.txt***

**so I can see if the file will be triggered.

Hi Matt, thanks I didn't see it. The client will send that file encrypted correct?

So it would be*necu_enrollment_06172022_110000.txt.pgp*.

Also, in the provided file. The client forgot to include the SMS for each entry. Can you tell them to do that? I will retest it once I get an update file. Thanks.

Client reported the following:



Hi Matt, we do not have cell phone for all of our membership. i do not believe, as i do not see how we would, that we are including SMS number for all members now. that should not be a mandatory field.

Fiserv does our encryption. For just the data validation, can you use this file without the encryption, knowing that Fiserv will encrypt in production?

Sorry, I mean if they do have an SMS number they can provided it, otherwise provide an empty one as each entry must have the right amount of columns. We expect to see 9, but we only get 8.

This is the first entry in the file, it have 8 columns. (No SMS provided)

*001237606|3328070028|CK|Go Green|yasa_m@hotmail.com|E|EMAIL|1655463532*

If they don't have a SMS they can just update the entry to this. (empty for the SMS)

*001237606|3328070028|CK|Go Green|yasa_m@hotmail.com||E|EMAIL|1655463532*



As for the encryption, yes this file that I'm currently using for testing on Pilot is acceptable. But for production, the file should be encrypted.

Hi Matt,

I ran the file through the scanner. It looks good. Can you have the client confirm on Pilot? Thanks.


author: mattl
comment: Hi [~mac]Can you confirm exactly what the client needs to be confirming?

comment: [~MattL]

They can check on InfoTRAC or the eStatement site if they can view the paperless status of these accounts if they would like.

Pilot, if its good by the client. I can go ahead and release to prod.


author: mattl
comment: [~mac]I've requested the client review in pilot. Please be advised this may take a day or two as the client typically has long response times.

Hi Matt,

We can support these two file naming conventions

necu_enrollment_MMDDYYYY.txt.pgp and ENROLLMENT_449_MMDDYYYY.TXT

We will need new dates, so let me know.


author: eric.yan
comment: The first day of the new file naming convention is 9/25/22.


author: mattl
comment: Hi [~eric.yan]are we good to accept the following formats?



necu/enrollment/enrollment_449_MMDDYYYY.MMHHSS.TXT.pgp



&


|necu/enrollment/necu_enrollment_MMDDYYYYY.MMHHSS.TXT.pgp|


author: eric.yan
comment: Hi [~MattL],

Yes, I've updated the names in the file scheduler. But we need to confirm with [~mac]and see if the scanner job needs to be updated as well.

I also manually process the four files with new naming convention in the following sequential order.



necu_enrollment_09232022.384094.TXT.pgp

enrollment_449_09232022.384111.TXT.pgp

necu_enrollment_09252022.384473.TXT.pgp
enrollment_449_09252022.384495.TXT.pgp
