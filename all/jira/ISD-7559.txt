comment: Hi [~Ricky Lopez],

I set it up so that it will automatically post the CIF file. I used the file*BRIL_CIF_072122.txt* which was successfully posted to Pilot. However, the newer files seems incorrect. I found these files on production, inside the EQBK folder as the client are sending it there. Correct me If I'm wrong, but I believe the client should be sending these files to the BRIL folder?

Correct:[^BRIL_CIF_072122.txt]

Incorrect:[^BRIL_CIF_080822.txt]



Thanks,

Mac

comment: [~phoebe.george], do BRIL files go in Equity folder or does BRIL have its own folder?

comment: [~mac] 
All BRIL files will go to EQBK FTP.
CIF file specifically should go to eqbk\estmt

Thanks

Hi Ricky, for the fileBRIL_CIF_MMDDYY.txt, can the client send it to the BRIL FTP instead of the EQBK FTP? On our end, we do have a folder for BRIL.



Also, can you update the dates for this ticket?



Thanks,

Mac

Hi Ricky, any updates on this? I hope you saw my previous comment.

Thanks,

comment: [~mac] I reviewed with Ricky - unfortunately, we cannot setup a separate FTP for 'BRIL'. However, we can setup a separate sub-folder within EQBK's FTP directory for 'bril' - will this work for automated processing?

Thanks!

Hi Phoebe, unfortunately, we can't do that then as the file needs to be sent through BRIL's FTP for the automated trigger of the file for BRIL. If it is sent through EQBK, it will auto trigger for EQBK instead.

Thanks,

Mac

comment: [~mac] One option I wanted to ask is similar to what we did for 'CAMB/IVBK' setup, as CAMB is the 'parent' company that hosts the FTP, and IVBK is the 'child company'.

Because the file is going to EQBK, can we have the file automatically copied to a 'brilbu' folder on our back end? That way, EQBK can continue to send the file to their current location, but we move it to the correct 'bril' folder in internally only. Let me know if this is possible (if it makes sense).

[~Ricky Lopez] FYI

Hi Phoebe, you are right actually.

I set up EQBK/BRIL like how CAMB/IVBK is set up and it works. The BRIL files will also be copied to the 'eqbkbu' folder, it won't get copied into brilbu folder. The file will be auto triggered and posted for BRIL, does this sound good? When is the release date for this?

Thanks,

Mac

Can you confirm if we can update to decrypt the file first before processing? I did not include that in the extension name, but the client is encrypting the file.

As we spoke today over the meeting,

I checked EQBK's latest CIF file ofEQBK_CIF_082922.txt and it opens correctly, it was encoded in UTF-8 which is expected and the file processed successfully. Can we see why BRIL's file is being encoded differently even though they mentioned that they have the same setup I believe?

Thanks,

Mac

comment: [~mac] Now that the issue with the CIF file is resolved for BRIL (and EQBK), can we move forward with scheduling this automation to load the BRIL file automatically?

Thanks!

comment: Hi [~mac], I was needing to follow up on this scheduling. Thanks

Do we have new live dates? I'm ready on my end.

comment: [~mac]-This can be released, is it possible to include with todays, if not when is the next possible release? Thanks
