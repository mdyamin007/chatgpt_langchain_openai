comment: User with email addressis tied to44037489 and10767320, however client is saying they should be tied to70118625,70118633, and70112016. No users are tied to the 3 accts client mentioned, which were all created on 7/13/18. MSBK used to have an auth file process but it was discontinued in mar 2020, and post process was removed in 2016 anyway.

comment: User only appears to be logging in to their personal accts, not their business. None of the statements under the business accts have been viewed and there's no user relationships to any of them, however client is claiming they can login to those business accts. Issue still remains where because the ufa doesnt exist for the business accts, the email isn't saved either and so the user is not receiving emails when stmts post.

comment: Internal call, everyone acknowledged that the SOW does not contain much information on how we should handle business user emails and perhaps with the turnover rate at msbk, it might be expected that we dont handle business emails and the newer employees at msbk may not be aware. Pending response from client.
