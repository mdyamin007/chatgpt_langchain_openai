comment: Hi [~Jessica],

Upon making the updates, I also found that their logo image contains e-Statements and e-Notices. Do they also want this updated? I attached screenshot tkcu_logo.PNG to this ticket. If so, please have them provide the new image in .jpg format and I can replace the old one on the sites. Current dimensions are 201 x 86 pixels.


author: jessica
comment: Yes I think they want it removed everywhere. I will ask them to provide us a logo.


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: Thanks, in the meantime I'll work on getting pilot screenshots for the rest of the places where the text is updated.


author: jessica
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] Customer send the attached logo. Let me know if this will work.


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: Hi [~Jessica], the logo works but it was a bit bigger than the current logo. I reduced the size to match the existing logo to ensure it doesn't affect the rest of the site. I've attached screenshots of the disclosure (tkcu_pilot_disclosure.PNG), home page for estatements (tkcu_pilot_sso_estatement.PNG), and home page for enotices (tkcu_pilot_sso_enotice.PNG) for them to review changes on the member site. 

I didn't provide any screenshots for the pilot admin site since they should be able to login themselves, here's an account they can check to verify the verbiage for estatements and enotices: 1115156

comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] They want to re-size the logo. What size should they send?


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~Jessica] the current logo on the site is 201 x 86 pixels, so I would suggest they provide it in that size.


author: jessica
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima]Attached is an updated logo. client requested the following:  Also, on the disclosures, can we make it consistent and change e-Disclosures to eDisclosures and e-Disclosure to eDisclosure?


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~Jessica] the updated logo TKCU Header.jpg is size 629 x 269 pixels, so I would still have to downsize it myself if they are ok with that. 

Also if they want to make the verbiage consistent and remove the hyphen from e-Disclosure(s), should we also remove it from e-tax and/or e-sign as shown in the screenshots I provided? If so then it would be an additional programming hour to make these changes.


author: jessica
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] attached is a new logo and yes please make the additional changes. they will pay the extra hour.


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: Thanks [~Jessica].

I've updated the logo and made the additional verbiage updates on pilot, so we should no longer see the following words with hyphens:
eStatement(s)
eNotice(s)
eTax(es)
eSign
eDisclosure(s)

Please provide the attached additional/updated screenshots to the client for pilot review.

comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] Customer feedback:
I just saw something that "technically" should be changed that is unrelated. At the bottom of the eNotice, eStatement and eTax page it should be (800) 456-4828, option 6.

This would remove the ext. 2255 and put option 6 instead. Technically it isn't wrong with the 2255, but we changed this a long time ago. What would be the charge, or possibility, of changing this too? If it's not, it is approved as is.


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~Jessica] We can update the phone number too since it's just verbiage in the code, but it would be an additional hour. If they wish to proceed, I can probably make the change as early as eod today. 


author: jessica
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima]go ahead and proceed. I will add the additional hours to the work order


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~Jessica] Change has been made on pilot, attached updated screenshots for etax, enotice, and estatement. 


author: jessica
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima]The changes and additional hours are approved.


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~Jessica] thanks, I'll get this moved onto stage for QA to test.

Can we also update the due date? If it's up to me, I think we can release to production by 4/20 so that we can give QA a bit more time to test if needed.

comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] Due date has been updated.

comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid], this consists of multiple verbiage updates on both SSO and the admin site. Below are the items to verify:
* All hyphens should be removed from the following words: eStatement(s), eNotice(s), eTax(es), eSign, eDisclosure(s). For SSO, it's mainly checking the disclosure on the enrollment steps and the Statement tab upon logging in. On the admin site, we would need to check each tab. Note: There may be some slightly different casing such as Esign vs ESIGN, that should be fine. 
* On the SSO site, there should be a phone number (800) 456-4828, option 6 when viewing each statement tab.
* The logo at the top left corner on both SSO and admin site should not contain any hyphens in 'eStatements and eNotices'. 

For the SSO test page, you can use the default sso7 tab and the rest should be straightforward. Here are some accounts which should take you to the enrollment steps and has estatements, enotices, and etaxes to verify the verbiage:
8265332
7356963

Feel free to use the pilot screenshots for reference. Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks!
