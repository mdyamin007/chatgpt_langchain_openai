PLEASE NOT BELOW ISSUE:

while creating the test file I encountered and issue and it can be problematic if not addressed.

2 out of 3 provided test account have the verbiage "Consolidated Analysis Statement" too close to the address lines. (see cambaa_bad) this causes the program to pick up this verbiage instead of line 6 of data.

the other account is ok. (see cambaa_good)



seems like because the contact and phone number are empty those fields are omitted, and its causing the body of statement to be shifted up. these fields do exist in the prod file even if the values are empty. (see cambaa_prod)



Please advise how to proceed.



Thanks!

comment: changed due date since I have not gotten feedback since the 21st of June.

comment: Hi Hosein, FISERV is wondering how far down they need to move the"Consolidated Analysis Statement" down. They are also concerned that this will effect the good accounts.

FISERV is having to update their template to accommodate this change on their end. Hence the delay.


author: hkhosravani
comment: Hi Matt,



as long as they don't remove the contact an date lines one the right (these could be blank lines instead of the verbiages) the process should be OK. the attached screenshots should show the spacing needed for this fix.


author: mattl
comment: Thanks [~hkhosravani], I've forwarded this to the client, they also advised that it maybe a few more weeks before they're able to get this back to us.

Can you advise where the screenshot are attached?

author: hkhosravani
comment: No problem just let me know when. Also can we move the live date back since it'll be a few weeks until client gets back to us?






author: mattl
comment: Sorry! Client has not approved. Client advised they are still working on updated from Fiserv.

comment: I will place this change to HOLD status.


author: mattl
comment: Hi [~Peter.Dang] , the Epic ticket has been on hold for a few weeks.

It looks like this client sent some revised data files on ticket 19513 comment 65

Can you please take a look and advise if that is what we'll need to proceed with the project?


V/r

New test file has been processed without issue. I attached a DPVS (cambaa1130_DPVS.pdf) and a set of pdf samples (camb_aa_samples.pdf) have been uploaded to your secure share folder since file size exceeds Jira max.

Note - Logo is missing from samples since this uses preprint.

Client finally approved. Please let me know when you'll be able to pick this project back up.

comment: [~MattL]Got a new timeline, start date 2/15, live date 3/15


author: mattl
comment: Hi [~rodriguez],

Is there any chance we can resume this project.

It has been open since mid June 2021, and from what I can see all we need to do is print samples and Parallel testing.



Please advise.

It is highly possible I can pick this back up next week. Since this project timeline was updated, I have been working on a daily imp project, an SNFB core conversion, other miscellaneous projects plus tickets and helping out with the new programmers getting adjusted. I've been busy. It may seem all we need to do is print samples and parallel testing but this is a RedTitan project and must be handled with care, so its not as easy as it seems to people looking in from the outside. Plus, this project was assigned to another dev and unexpectedly assigned to me when the original dev left.

With that being said, I may be able to pick this up again next week. Right now SNFB Guardian Black Knight Core Conversion is number one on my list. I'll keep you posted.

comment: Hi [~rodriguez]just want to confirm the 3/15 is still viable.


author: rodriguez
comment: Hi [~MattL], for sure, 3/15 is still viable. I'm waiting for Rukmani to wrap up IS-843 so I can use the updated code. As soon as that rolls out I will finish my testing and have this over to QA some time by Wednesday next week at the latest.

author: rodriguez
comment: [~Igor.Khosid] [~MattL]Looks like they printed the incorrect samples. Correct samples should have 2D prefix xhb. Also, the address is formatted incorrectly in the print samples. The correct format are in the xhb 2d prefix samples. Please request again using the DPVS "PRINT_DPVS_CAMB_AA.pdf". Same filename and range.

comment: [~Igor.Khosid] [~MattL]Samples look good




author: mattl
comment: [~rodriguez]is there anyway, given the time frame of this ticket, we by-pass Parallel.


author: rodriguez
comment: [~MattL]this was ready for parallel on 3/7 when QA was completed. Not sure what happened, but no we cannot bypass parallel for this. There is grouping and this is redtitan. Too risky to bypass parallel.


author: mattl
comment: Hi [~rodriguez],



I'll open the PR but just an FYI I can not open PR tickets until we have print samples.
