title: 22144 - BANB - PDF Captcha code bug
description: Customers had issues going past the pdf captcha step of the enrollment steps. This was only happening sometimes on certain clicks because of how the captcha code was being pulled. Updates were made so that the correct code is pulled on every click of the 'I can see PDF' button.

There was an issue with new customers sometimes not being able to move past the PDF captcha page on the enrollment steps. We rolled out a fix on pilot, can you help us test? Below is some info on how to hit the enrollment steps:

q2sso hypercube no nicknames/q2sso hypercube: Either page should work
CIF Number: Any cif number that does not exist in the database.
UserType: P
All other fields can remain with prefilled values.

Ideally we want to hit the enrollment steps, enter the pdf captcha code, click on the 'I can see PDF' button, and then proceed to the next page without errors. 

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Shun

Can you help me verify the PDF Captcha code fix again, but on SSO stage this time? All we did was move the code update from the pilot code to the stage code, so everything should be the same as on pilot. Let me know if you would prefer to do a screenshare again to expedite this.

Thanks,
Shun
