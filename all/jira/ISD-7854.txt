There were issues with the formatting in the last index.

Please use instead:

I processed_ml1_20220815_1_20221114_1114_hrtb.txt_ and_ml2_20220815_1_20221114_1121_hrtb.txt_ and encountered data error. Those files didn't contain *Account Type* on each line.

Please, update the files and let me know.

Please confirm which type of statements will be processed via ml3 and ml4.

For example, from previous comments,

ml1_20220815_1_20221111_1206_hrtb.txt => Loan
 ml2_20220815_1_20221111_1222_hrtb.txt => HELOC

ml1 will be Loan and ml2 will be HELOC.

I need to know this for ml3 and ml4 also before posting those on Pilot.

Thanks
