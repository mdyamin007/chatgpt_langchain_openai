title: EWBB - [33042][pvt][in-house] Escrow Analysis Statement Account Number Update (ML4)
description: Hot fix for ML Escrow Analysis (ML4 applications):

Update EWBBML41.dfa to no longer expect a maximum of 10 characters (i.e. do not truncate any part of the account number). While the longest account number in any previous cycle has been 10, that should not be taken as fact. Rather, the program should accommodate a longer account number.

Hi Gnana,

I have made updates to EWBBML41.dfa,EWBBML51.dfa, and EWBBML61.dfa to match Andy's changes to his EWBBML11.dfa and EWBBML21.dfa. Please review.
 * Exported updated project files to: \\download-nas02\qa\EWBB\EWBBML41.zip

I have also reprocessed in parallel to produce an e-statement index file containing a couple 10-digit account numbers:
 * E-statement index file:ml4_20220916_1_20220920_0949_ewbb.txt
 ** Acct#6666666666
 ** Acct#7777777777

Thanks,
 Sam
