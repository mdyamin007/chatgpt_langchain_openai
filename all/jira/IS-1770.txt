Please export project to QA folder


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~rony]- Can you please provide a sample with LFC and ST? I don't see those fields on any of the samples.


author: JIRAUSER11700
comment: From the samples, nothing strikes me as bad.
Since we have no requirements but a few remarks made on a page, I think let the client look at the sample and decide if they want us to change anything.
Just in case:

PKWH - KWH Rate - page 1

LFC - Late Fee Amount - page 11

ST - Sales Tax Amount & Tax Rate - page 5

comment: [~rony]- 1 update. Please remove "Tax Rate" from printing. Please see attached.

comment: Validated the fields in the project, all ok. Tax Rate is indeed removed.

The TS ticket says the new fields are currently being sent in the data file.
Is it the data file exported with the project?
Just in case, wanted to make sure the field names in the data file (PKWH, LFC, ST) match the ones told us by the client.

Actually no. The data file exported with the project is a modified small data file that contains all 3 fields. But herethe field names in the data file match the ones told us by the client.

Thanks.
