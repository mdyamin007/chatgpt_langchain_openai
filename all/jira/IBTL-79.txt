comment: [~hkhosravani]: Can you troubleshoot and share the parameters that is being passed into /home/test/master/update_insert.sh so that we can research what the issue is?

Need to know if his a permission issue, directory missing, paperless file missing, or etc?

If so, what is the value the program is expecting so that we can look at it.

comment: [~hkhosravani]: Cool! so the root cause of the issue was the contents of the paperless file. I thought it was a missing directory or some.. thx!
