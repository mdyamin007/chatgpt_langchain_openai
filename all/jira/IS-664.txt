I noticed the timeline given is just outside of the customers target live date. Could we please use the below timeline?

We would like these inserts to start on 12/27 statements (rec'd 12/28) and end on 1/26 statements (rec'd 1/27).

comment: [~Kbittmann] The timeline on Epic is showing 12/27 but sample date is still the same. I think we can still follow that timeline on Epic ticket. Sample to QA 12/21 and approval date 12/24 then parallel and go LIVE 12/27. Unless client takes longer to approve etc.

These are selective but out of the 15k+ accounts in this cycle less than 100 have no insert - almost all have Privacy insert. Some accounts have both the Privacy insert and the NSF insert. No account have only NSF insert.



The 3 PDFs below are from PDF archival process on test.

has both inserts ->[^12192021_808097498_83.pdf]

has only privacy insert ->[^12192021_186045898_3771.pdf]

has no insert ->[^12192021_161036023_15070.pdf]

Per our discussion DP will hold weekend cycle and code will need to be rolled back first thing 1/31.

No need to hold weekend cycles. We just need to completed the rollback before we process the 1/31 file.
