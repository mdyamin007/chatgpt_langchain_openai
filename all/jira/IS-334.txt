comment: Hi [~eric.yan] [~dyuen]

The resource should be uploaded now. 
One thing I noticed is that the index file dla_20210305_1_20210831_1115_wash.txt on stage has accts with enotice 017, but not 018. If I'm not mistaken, shouldn't we be testing both 017 and 018? Or is there perhaps a new index file that I'm not aware about?

[~Igor.Khosid], fyi notices 017 and 018 already exist with the description 'Overdraft Notice', so I think the resource is the only thing that was needed from ISD's end.

Thank you, Shun



Eric,
Please let me know if the new index file is needed.


author: eric.yan
comment: [~Igor.Khosid] [~Shun.Kuwashima] 

Both 017 and 018 uses the same resource, but I only found data file for 017. Testing just 017 should be sufficient in this case.
