comment: Per Tina:

The process we documented and communicated to the client facing team in 2019 & again as a refresher in early 2020, remains the same. It should have been uploaded to the wiki for review.



We manage the process through a ticket.

If its handled through IMP b/c its part of a full color programming effort, it goes through the parallel process.



There are no forms and there are no questions to ask. The message either prints in color or it doesnt.



The only risk is that the AM didnt pay attention to the client list for who cannot be sold the service. Celeste becomes the gatekeeper on that, b/c she will validate prior to generating the addendum.
