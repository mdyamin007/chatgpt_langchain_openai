title: EWBB - [33042][pvt][in-house] 1098 Account Number Update (ML5)
description: Hot fix for 1098 (ML5 applications):

Update EWBBML51.dfa to no longer expect a maximum of 10 characters (i.e. do not truncate any part of the account number). While the longest account number in any previous cycle has been 10, that should not be taken as fact. Rather, the program should accommodate a longer account number.

Hi Gnana,

I have made updates to EWBBML41.dfa,EWBBML51.dfa, and EWBBML61.dfa to match Andy's changes to his EWBBML11.dfa and EWBBML21.dfa. Please review.
 * Exported updated project files to: \\download-nas02\qa\EWBB\EWBBML51.zip

I have also reprocessed in parallel to produce an e-tax index file containing a couple 11-digit account numbers:
 * E-tax index file: etax_1098_12312021_50_09202022_090531_ewbb.txt
 ** Acct#55555555555
 ** Acct#99999999999

Thanks,
 Sam

Posted index file in stage " etax_1098_12312021_50_09202022_090531_ewbb.txt " 
Verified the sample acct # 555555555,  Acct#99999999999 ,looks good 
Verified the acct #9142097---esite posted statement has leading zeros(which is expected)-0009142097

Sam -Can you confirm if there is any control file change at all

I can confirm that there is no control file change for my mortgage applications as "track_by_rec" is already turned on.

Thanks,
Sam
