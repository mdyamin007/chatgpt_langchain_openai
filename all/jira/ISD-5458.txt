Can you please confirm me the followings:
1. Will new accounts will be created via etax process?

2. Will email notification be sent automatically after etax process? (For doc process, they send email notification automatically).

3. Do we have a confirmed archival period for etax?

Thanks,
Moshiur

Can you please provide me the pilot date of this?

Thanks,
Moshiur


author: kericapote
comment: [~moshiur.rahman] it's currently 1/3.


author: moshiur.rahman
comment: [~kericapote] 
Is the sample file ready? If the pilot date is 1/3, We'll have to process the sample file to check whether the p-ui setup from our end is correct. Also, we'll have to make sure that from the customer site the etaxes are showing properly or not.

Thanks
Moshiur

comment: [~moshiur.rahman] you will need to coordinate with IS for that.

comment: [~tai.trinh]: Do you think we can have someone help post the pilot files versus waiting for DSi tonight? If so, can you please update [~andreav]& [~diegof]that it was posted. If not, then we will have to wait tomorrow morning. Hopefully there is no issues.

 I tried to process the above two files on pilot but got error. Error code is 103 which is "Account Type is Missing". So, I think account type is required for pfcu etax file.
 Also, I was getting another error saying DT_JOB_ID is missing. But I did bypass this error via p-ui frontend.
 
Thanks,
 Moshiur

comment: [~moshiur.rahman] there should be a conversion done in terms of the account type. the tax entries i believe come in as '30' but internally IS will pass 'TX'.

also i have moved pfcu_cif_01032022.dly.pgp to the pickup folder. can you process this file in the pilot system.


author: moshiur.rahman
comment: [~diegof] 
 # I've processed pfcu_cif_01032022.dly on pilot. All data are processed properly but 3 rows got warning. acctname were missing for line 6881 and 29553. Thats why, user has been created but account creation has been skipped. nickname was missing in line 19509, but, both user and account has been created.
 # Is 'TX' is a new account type for PFCU?
 # As i stated before, acctType is required in etax files. So please let me know when you can provide me the updated etax files so that i can go ahead and process those.

Thanks,
Moshiur

comment: [~moshiur.rahman] please post to pilot asap for customer review. Timeline shows due today. Unfortunately these MUST mail 1/31 as they are taxes and we do not have any flexibility.

The 3archival samples that [~thomasY]provided (PFCU_1098_311_2021.zip.pgp, PFCU_1099I_311_2021_1.zip.pgp, PFCU_1099I_311_2021_2.zip.pgp), we usually don't process these archival sample files from our end i.e eStatement side. Can you please ask the IS team to process those files.

We usually process index files provided by IS team. As stated earlier, I need the updated etax index files so that I can process that on pilot. Perviously, account type were missing from the index files thats why it couldn't be processed.

Thanks,
 Moshiur

comment: [~moshiur.rahman] I need you to work directly with IS. You can post on their ticket or @ them here on this ticket. The pilot was due 1/7 so please let me know when it is ready asap. Thx

I tried to process the etax files that you provided. The account type related issue is now resolved. There were no data related error there. But, etaxes were not posted because, zip files were not exist on server. Can you please check whether the zip files are on server so that I can process?

Thanks,

I've processed two files on pilot.

etax_1098_12312021_311_01112022_134846_pfcu.txt is processed successfully.
etax_1099int_12312021_311_01112022_135036_pfcu.txt is also processed but 77 rows (from line 1453-1529) failed because account number is missing in that rows.

Can you please confirm me the archival period for etax? As there is no SOW and the archival period for the other statement types is 36 months, currently 36 months is setup for etax as well. Please let me know if its needed to be changed.

Thanks,
Moshiur


author: kericapote
comment: [~moshiur.rahman] I just added SOW as I went over it this morning with the client. Please review. They want 18 mo for tax archival. Thanks!


author: moshiur.rahman
comment: [~kericapote] 
According to SOW, archival period is 18 months for etax. In Infotrac, archival period for all statement type is set as 13 months. No individual archival period is set. Should I keep this as it is i.e. 13 months for all statement types including etax? Or do I need to set individual archival i.e 18 months for etax and 13 months for the other statement types on infotrac? Please confirm.
Thanks,
Moshiur


author: kericapote
comment: [~moshiur.rahman] please do 18 mo. for taxes only. The archival per the SOW for other applications is 36 mo.

comment: [~moshiur.rahman] DP has posted the 1098 and 1099INT files onto stage for parallel testing, can you verify them? You may need to release/approve the jobs internally in order to view them on the stage sites.  


author: moshiur.rahman
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] 
I've approved the two files1098 and 1099INT on stage.

comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] [~kericapote] 
I've released this update on production. Release note is attached to this ticket above. I've also updated the Hypercube Versions document. You can take a look.

Thanks,

author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~moshiur.rahman] Fyi, the etax email template was not enabled in the InfoTRAC client management configs on prod. I added it in per Keri's request, however please make note of this for future app setups.
