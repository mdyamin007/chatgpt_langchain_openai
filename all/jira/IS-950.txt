comment: [~Najoa]Client approved on 3/24 @8:50am. Please move to QA. Please provide dpvs, file id and image range for QA print sample request.
[~Igor.Khosid]Approved sample is the only one sample attached to this ticket. I do not see a post live section on your smartsheet any longer, let me know if I should attach latest approved sample on the original row for 059 letter.
