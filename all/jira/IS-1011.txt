I don't believe we've ever received a 2021 1099-INT test file, so I'm not sure if there are any changes in format that would require an update. Below was the client's response from back when the differences between the 2020 and 2021 1098 forms were brought to their attention:

_"You are correct, our vendor had an issue at year end and we had to quickly switch to a new vendor for year end related documents. All the other files are the same, we still use the existing vendor for these documents. You will need to program for the new 1098 documents, that can be done secondarily."_

Please check with the client. In the meantime, we can proceed with the update to accommodate the 2021 1098 changes. Thanks!

Please have the client review samples for the 2021 1098 file on pilot.

Please also ask the client about a 2021 1099-INT file.

Thanks!

Hi Sam,

The index file is already processed successfully on staging PUI, but I don't see tax forms on InfoTrac. Actually I don't see any statements on tested accounts.

Accounts I tested:

10003115
5810026155
87802833
6810006340

Thank you,

I took a look at the InfoTrac staging site, and I was able to see the estatements for the accounts you listed.

Sam , you attached screen shot from InfoTrac Job Status tab. I need to verify accounts on InfoTrac Account Management tab and they are not showing

What's the status for verifying the 1099-INT e-posting?

In case you missed Phoebe's e-mail response, she said that "EWBB uses Admin Portal, not InfoTrac site for production/pilot."

Thanks!

At this point, samples for both the 1098 and 1099-INT changes are available for client review on the pilot site.

One thing of note is that I had to fix the file names for both the test files used:
 * ewbb_ml_tax__1099I_12312021.pdf.pgp   ->  ewbb_ml_tax_1099I_12312021_01.pdf.pgp (extra underscore before 1099I and missing segment)
 * ewbb_ml_tax_1098_12312021.pdf.pgp    ->  ewbb_ml_tax_1098_12312021_01.pdf.pgp (missing segment)

comment: [~SamV2021] I received approval from EWBB on the pilot site; okay to move forward with next steps.
