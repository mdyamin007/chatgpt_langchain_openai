[IS-357] TFCU HELOC - Enable selective account and zip code for MM3 - Jira (infoimageinc.com)

Delayed for few weeks.



Nar has two upcoming Implementation projects that he is starting now and later this month. We absolutely do not want these TFCU project to drag to further along impacting is other two implementation projects. Can we get client commitment to get these two projects approved this week and probably we can re-schedule for an EOM live date into next month, there is a potential that this project will not resume until February 2022.



Please advise.




author: william.kong
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]: At this time, we cannot commit any resourcing for this project until next year. Please ask client when next year they want to resume this project. We want to+reserve+ the timeslots for [~jira_naru] . Please provide update on this when you return from your vacation.


author: william.kong
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]: We cannot resume this project until February or later. Please advise client to still reach out to you to plan when to resume this project so that we can plan ahead during the code freeze for when on February or afterwards to resume. Please do not wait to February to reach out, otherwise this project will delay further more.



{color:#de350b}*If there is no response by Jan 31, 2022, we will ask that this project close out and billed.*{color}

author: william.kong
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]: [~jira_naru]clarified. The code is released already. If they want to use this new criteria, they just need to select and apply it. For now, we will close out this project as you requested above.
