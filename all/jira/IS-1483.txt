I can't create a new parallel id because sscudle.control is held by another id20220812100803

The updated to is added/home/test/control/sscudle.control

The update can be viewed on stage. AOLP is turned off.

comment: [~jun] Do you need to merge your update with the current programming update, or can you release yours after? We don't want to release this until some time AFTER 9/1, as I believe the current update that AC is working on is scheduled to go live 8/29. The CU still wants to keep AOLP for this change and then disable after 9/1 some time.

[~Igor.Khosid] Please confirm if you can complete QA on stage instead, we do not need customer's approval on pilot site since we are 'disabling', not enabling this feature.

Thanks!

comment: [~jun] I forgot to ask if this update requires a parallel test. Please confirm. Thanks!

comment: [~phoebe.george], I can release this as planned on 9/1. Natalie will be releasing her update without this one then I will merge the code. We don't need parallel testing.
