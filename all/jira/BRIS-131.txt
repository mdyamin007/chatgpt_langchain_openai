I+think+ changed the IP address to 10.4.20.24; I can't find the email/Jira ticket mentioning that he changed from 10.5.20.24 to 10.4.20.24.



I tried pinging both IP addresses and no activity.



I pinged the DNS name ad it is resolving to 10.4.20.24, so I believe this is the correct IP address, but please double-check with Kent to be sure. If so, can we update the Brisbane Smartsheet row 538.

comment: [~premraj.patil] and [~kent.chan]: Can you review this ca-rcs-pr-01 down time issue and confirming the correct IP address clarification request. Not urgent. Sometime later this week is fine.
