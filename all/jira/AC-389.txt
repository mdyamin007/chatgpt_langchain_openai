*Per client's comment #53 on TS#23875 1/12/2022:*

*What is the split count or size for each batch?*

500mb is fine.

*What will be the index filename?*

Happy to hear your suggestion. I'm just making this up on the fly but I'd assuming, something like... statementType-index-date

*What is the archival email recipient's address?*

itadmin@ppcu.org and possibly accounting@ppcu.org. The itadmin email I'm thinking should be the main email, so we can monitor any issues with the import.
