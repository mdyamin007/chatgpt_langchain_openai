I think it is okay to have createAccount enabled on Development. However, that should not be enabled on the higher environment (Pilot, Stage, etc.)

Hi [~tai.trinh]

In EtaxRegistrarFactory, we've used HypercubeEtaxRegistrar, it was basically developed for TKCU migration. The difference between EtaxRegistrar3 and HypercubeEtaxRegistrar is that, in EtaxRegistrar3, if an user is created based on the global.autoregistrar flag, then a SSO date is inserted for that user. This logic doesn't exist in HypercubeEtaxRegistrar. And another difference is if user is created in EtaxRegistrar3, it doesn't insert in usr_mapping table, but in HypercubeEtaxRegistrar, it inserts in usr_mapping table, which is required for new hypercube clients. HypercubeEtaxRegistrar was developed to keep consistency with HypercubeEstmtRegistrar.  Let me know your thoughts on this.

Thanks,
Rifat

Hi Rifat,

I have reviewed the HypercubeEtaxRegistrar and the differences from ETaxRegistrar3. Everything looks good. 

Thanks,
Tai
