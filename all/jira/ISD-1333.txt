comment: Given a list of accounts, use Revert_To_Paper PUI process to revert each paperless record related to the accounts to paper. (all paperless records for all various stmt_types (Visa, HELOC, Membership, Business Visa)).
 
What Revert_To_Paper does, is it takes in a file with a list of account numbers, and account types (if global.enableAccountType is set to true in the conf file).
It will search for the account id related to the account numbers & account types (if account type is enabled). Then it will look for all paperless2 records linked to the account id, taking in the various stmt_type fields. It will query the paperless2 table based on acct_id and stmt_type, checking if the record doesn't exist, or whether the p_latest_status is not set to paper (B). If either is true, it will insert a record into the paperless table with new status as paper.
