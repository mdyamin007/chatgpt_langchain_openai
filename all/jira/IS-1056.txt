comment: Hi [~lemoy28]

Per our discussion, please update manual message for this month too. We will need to discuss with [~Peter.Dang]and [~William.Kong]in next scrum meeting for how to handle this.

This request comes every month without initial assessment. 

We will need provide instruction and training to change request developer. Currently SFCE is under [~rumanb] .



Hi [~Bryanl], I just see this request since we didn't access and reserve in IS resource list. The timeline is unrealistic. Due date is today. Please message to Le for possible sample date and live date.



Thanks,

Tun
