[~Kbittmann]: Approval dates are missed. Please advise client that we needed their approval yesterday. We are approaching code freeze and I do not want another escalation from IDCU to expedite code release when they missed their approval date. Live date is today.

IDCU is working on adding changes to the sample. They have been made aware this is more than likely to be pushed back till after code freeze.


author: william.kong
comment: [~Kbittmann]: I will put the status "On Hold" for now. Please still continue to get feedback from client so that we can plan and schedule when in Feb/March to resume this project.

author: william.kong
comment: [~Kbittmann]: Just curious. Any feedback on this project. As discussed, we will target Feb 1, 2022 on this project. But if they approve early we can see if we can release earlier (no guarantees as it is tax month). I will update due date to Feb 1, 2022 for now.

Still pending client feedback at this time.

Still pending sample approval. I've advised the client this will need to wait until after code freeze.


author: william.kong
comment: [~Kbittmann]: If they provide approvals before code freeze, please let us know anywayz so that we can schedule the resourcing to resume after code freeze. For now I will put status to "Waiting for Customer Approval".



If data passes Feb 1 without any news, I will put project status to be On Hold.

Sounds good.

comment: [~jun] Customer approved on 1/18. Please confirm new go live date.


author: william.kong
comment: [~jun]: Please schedule this with [~Igor.Khosid]to see when QA'snext availability is? Then we can see if the Feb 1, 2022 date be adjusted accordingly. With IDCU being a hypercare account, i think 'maybe' QA can try to squeeze it in.

Please prep your project for QA and update your Jira status.





Thanks!
