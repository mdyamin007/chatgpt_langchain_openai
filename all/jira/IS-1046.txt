File will not attach as Jira determined it too big of a file. Please review the TS ticket. 19324. comment 158.

Note that the page before the BRP inserts will be printed duplex but a blank page will be on the back. This is to mitigate an issue where the BRP inserts start printing on the back of the previous page when it should start on its own sheet.

Please inform the client that for this notice, rather than printing the 2 pages of the notice as simplex and duplex for all the BRP inserts, the first page of the notice will be printed simplex, the second page will be printed duplex with a blank back page, and the BRP inserts will be printed duplex.

Also, please create ISD story.

Thanks!

We will not be able to meet today's live date (06/30) as client has not yet provided feedback on the samples provided. Please provide a new timeline when possible. We will still need to request print samples and have QA do tap test, along with parallel testing.

Thanks,

Please see the below notes from BANB.
 # In the 3^rd^paragraph starting with I have enclosed on the 4^th^line, the word options has an extra space in the middle. Can you remove that space?
 # We will be changing the signature line name from time to time and will do so before we go live with this notice. Do you need to be notified?
 # No, we do not want the loan number truncated.
 # We will also send a new updated BRP.

Other than this, it looks very good.


author: JIRAUSER10906
comment: [~Kbittmann]
 # Yes, I will work on removing that extra space.
 # We do not to be notified for this change.
 # Sounds good.
 # Once the client sends an updated BRP, we will have to assess how many extra hours the client will be billed since we need to once again convert these pages into image resources.

Updated BRP is on Team support ticket 19324. File size is too big to attach to Jira ticket.


author: JIRAUSER10906
comment: [~Kbittmann]

Could you please confirm with the client whether only pages 1 and 2 of the latest BRP(Borrower Response Package 7-7.pdf) are different from the one provided previously (Borrower Response Package 6-9.pdf)

Thanks!


author: JIRAUSER10911
comment: [~SamV2021]

Yes, you are correct. That was the only change.

Per Jira description, this notice should not have eNotice or archival. Can you please confirm with the client that they truly want to exclude archival? All notices in this application are setup for archival, so to exclude this specific notice, we would either have to:
 # Exclude all heavies for all notices in this application (would need to ensure that no other notice producing heavies needs to be archived), OR
 # Rewrite the archival process (which would apply to all notices in this application). However, in this case, what ends up being archived are the format AFPs (no OMR, IMB) instead of the print step AFPs which are the ones currently being archived.

Please also request print samples:
 * PARALLEL ENVIRONMENT
 * DPVS:[^banbdla129_dpvs_rev2.pdf]
 * FILENAME: banbdla1295.hvy.afp
 * IMAGE RANGE:1-38
 * TRAY 1 STOCK: 4005

Please add a description of Archival Specifications:

 - file index structure
 - output directory

Archival description:
 * zip file: banb_DL_[cycle]_[seg].zip

 ** pdf: banbdla[segment][cycle][print afp].pdf (e.g. banbdla1295.hvy.pdf)
 ** no index file

 * output: in production, outputted to /d/infoftps3/BANB/client_pickup/banb_DL_[cycle]_[seg].zip

Zip file is correct banb_DL29_2.zip. I had included an extra '_' in my earlier comment. So, expected zip file naming isbanb_DL[cycle]_[seg].zip

My mistake! Thanks!


author: JIRAUSER11104
comment: [~Kbittmann]please update SOW for zip file naming:

Should be like this >> *zip file: banb_DL[cycle]_[seg].zip*
