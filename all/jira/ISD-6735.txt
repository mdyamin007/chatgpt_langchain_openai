comment: [~rifat.mahmud] Can you have some one look at this? Ethan is out for the week. This is a project to do PDF deconversion. Your team should have training on this already. This is on its own server and the script is inside Docker.



Ethan provided files for April 2021 and September 2021 mortgage, but this is what the client said about the April file:

-The April 2021 file looks like Home Equity statements, not mortgage statements.

-Correction, both Home Equity and Mortgage files are present here which is throwing me off a bit. These are typically not received together... any reason why they are combined?

Another question is they be separate.

Hi [~dyuen],

I'll be trying to test if I can get an archival with just mortgage statements today. Will have an update once a month is processed.

I've sent over:

Jan 2021

Mar 2021

mortgage statements to the client's pick up folder.

comment: Hey [~dyuen],

I've sent over:

April 2021

Sep 2021



As well. This should be all of it.

I'll wait for client confirmation that all looks good before closing this out.

Thanks.

comment: Hi [~Ethan.Yu], do you still have the index files? If you still do, can you attach to the Jira and/or place in their client pickup TEST folder?If not, can you at least provide the values/configurations of the index file?

Thanks

comment: Hey [~dyuen],

From my notes it looks like IS provided the archival for this job.

Ethan, Daphne provided archival specs to the client on ticket 25997 and they responded:

"I think we can work with that, I'll need to adjust a few things on my end but I think with the cross reference we built out recently, this should work."
