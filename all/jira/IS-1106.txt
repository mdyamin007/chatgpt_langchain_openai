As you can see, the story status is "In Progress," meaning that the project has never been submitted to QA for testing. Original timeline agreement for testing 07.15-07.21
Because of the EOM, I can't guarantee the estimated delivery dates

[~gthillaivel] - FYI Upon receiving the project, please expedite the testing if possible
