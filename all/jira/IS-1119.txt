description: Customer Reply:Yes ignore the minus in just principal tag. total I have for this s/b $25,030.82

Phoebe: You are correct, the value of the "Total" field comes from the summation of <principal>, <interest> and <lateFee> tags. Can you confirm what the total should display as for this particular example on your end. We mainly want to confirm if we need to ignore the minus sign for the principal tag or the minus sign altogether.

comment: Hi [~phoebe.george],

I tried to generate sample using production data cycle 0504. That data has only one customer.

And that customer has negative sign in data for Interest column.

For this reason the "Total" column is getting negative sign.

Please inform about this to client and we suggest to ignore negative sign from Principal, Interest and Fee fields so that the Total column value get correct value.

Thanks

comment: [~mahbubS] MVCU has agreed with your recommendation to ignore the negative sign from the Principal, Interest and Fee fields so that the Total column value get correct value. Can you proceed and provide samples?

Thanks,

1. I can't decrypt the file because the key is not available:
 !scr_key_is_not_available.png|thumbnail! 
2. The process with this index file did not work:
 !scr_PUI.png|thumbnail! 
3. I have to check E-Site Admin, but there is no statement for this date:

comment: [~Andrey.Kutsenko] Sorry, i forgot that although we originally coded for electronic, we did not fully enable in live production. This will be for print/PDF archival testing only.

Do you want me to provide the non-encrypted file to you?

[~berezinez] Not sure if you can assist with the decryption, or if I should provide the non-encrypt version of the data file.

About point 1:

For archival testing please use/z/pdf_afp/mvcu/mvcuml4/zip/MvcuBusinessLoan_archival_050422_1.zip.001

I mailed to [~Shun.Kuwashima]about issue 2 and 3.

I released following code per your message. I just notice that the status is still on "QA completed". I am not sure parallel passed or not.

If you have parallel issue and need to roll back or update, message me again.
