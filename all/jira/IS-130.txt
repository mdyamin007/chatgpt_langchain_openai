QA test result: Pass and Sample ready for Customer review
Additional testing will be after client approval:
1. Index file posting and validating content on the Admin site
2. Print samples validation after the sample will be approved by the customer

comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid],

Regarding the index file, since it's just 1 account, I created it on stage and was able to post the index file successfully on pilot/stage. Additionally after looking at the code, it appears we've never set up flcu to show notice descriptions on the site, so I think it is expected to have no descriptions. Therefore, the only testing for the e-side would be simply pulling the enotice.

The client requested some changes to the document. Please see the attached pdf. They would also like the blank page 2 removed.[^Welcome Packet Sample with notations.pdf]


author: jun
comment: [~jharvey]Attached new PDF samples "FLCUWL002_Samples_07092021.pdf".

The blank page can't be removed. This notice is set up as duplex. The blank page is the back page. We can add some verbiage like "This page is left blank intentionally" if they don't want it to look blank.

I have 2 questions:
 # Can you please check with customer we can use the loan account number field to post?We were not able to find acct#0009782784. This might be because it's a test account. Just wanted to double check I am getting the correct field for account number to post.
 # Will this application start using paperless file since now it has enotice? If yes, I need to add the existing letter "001" to ignore paperless since that letter doesn't have enotice.

comment: Jun,

Customer responded on ticket 19853:

FYI, we were testing the end-to-end file transfer process and there is a new test file in the \Test folder of your FTP site. We had to rename the file inside the zip to Solar Loans Data. Would you be able to provide a sample for this test file in addition to the first test file?

As for the questions from your IT team:

1. Yes, you may use the Account Number + Loan ID to uniquely identify the records.

2. Yes, we request that the welcome letter be emailed to those members who have opted to receive communication electronically vs. printed. All the rest, should be printed and mailed.

If the words regarding the blank page may be added, that would be great.

comment: Hi [~billr],I only mentioned if the account # can be used to post. Not sure why customer is now mentioning acct # + loan id. They might've got confused with the question. I will ask ISD to check if acct # + loan id will work for posting enotices.

Hi [~tye.wu@infoimageinc.com] [~Shun.Kuwashima],

Can you please check if these 4 account #+loan id below exist for posting?? Customer said to use acct# + loan id to post.

Acct#:

97809713001
 97809713003

97827843000

97827843003

Attached PDF sample FLCUWL002_Samples_07122021.zip with the new fixes.

Please send samples to customer to review while we look at the enotice posting issue.

comment: hi [~tye.wu@infoimageinc.com] [~Shun.Kuwashima],

Any update on if FLCU can use acct # + loan id to post? I don't think we need loan id to post. Customer might've just misunderstood the original question. Please double check before we clarify with customer.



Acct#:

9780971*3001*
9780971*3003*

9782784*3000*

9782784*3003*

comment: Hi [~jun],

As per our spark, I believe we should be posting to the accts 9780971 and 9782784, which is what we have going for us anyway. 

[~billr]: The only question I have remaining is whether we should enable account creation for enotice postings. Acct 9780971 does not on production, so if we were to receive this account in an enotice production file first before a statement file, it will not post. Should we keep enotice account creation disabled?

comment: [~billr]: PLease advise status. Have you responded to Shun's question above. Live date is on Wednesday.  Just want to make sure we are on schedule since we are still pending client approvals.


author: jharvey
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima]

Please go ahead and enable account creation for enotics postings.



[~William.Kong]

The client may not gain approval before our Go Live date on Wednesday, sometimes their reviewers take longer than a day or two, I will work with IS and ISD to gain a new Go Live date if this happens.


author: jharvey
comment: [~jun]

Client approved new samples provided. Would you please provide a new Go Live Date?


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: Thanks [~jharvey], I've enabled acct creation on lower environments, so we should be good to go for production release from ISD's end.
