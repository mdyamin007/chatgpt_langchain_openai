title: Tap test right - part of return address is not visible
description: !tapRight.png|width=694,height=477!

Return address ZIP code is not visible in tap test right. I'd also move the logo a bit up, if possible.

comment: [~zhuoxinT]thank you,
moving up was not critical though. The issue was the right side: the index is cut off then the paper is in the rightmost position.

As far as I can measure you need to move the logo block left 1/4" and scale it down so that its width is reduced by 1/4" (to 2 3/8"), then it should pass both tap left and tap right.

Thank you, updated on the parallel environment also.
Let me know if I need to do any changes.

comment: Decided not to scale down logo so that we don't create visible difference with letters already in production.
 Logo block moved left as far as it was possible; main zip code is now visible in tap right.
