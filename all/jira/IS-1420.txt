title: WASH - [31407][pvt][in-house] Electronic Overdraft Notice (EP6280P) sent to the wrong customer
description: The issue is happening due to extra blank page was inserted only for paper not for enoitce and the paper same paper txt is being used for enotice. So enotice is pulling extra page from next customer since blank page is not added enotice. To resolve this:


 # Remove the blank page addition from code
 # Display all the pages in duplex format, currently it is showing only the 1st page as duplex , subsequent pages as simplex but only used tray1 which sets to duplex.
