title: BBBB - [31239][pvt][in-house] DP - BBBB he file - Wrong Naming Convention
description: Total: 2 hrs

1 hr - Update bbbbdla_checklist.txt (contains regular expressions corresponding to valid files inside the original zip files). The script bbbb_process.sh currently already makes a call to check_files_in_zip.sh, so only this regular expression .txt file needs to be updated to correctly expect the right files.

1 hr - Test changes with invalid/valid 'he' zip file.



This will be a client change request.
