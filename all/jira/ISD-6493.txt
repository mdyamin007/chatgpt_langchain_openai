title: MFCU - MFCU - Member Statement Changes
description: # For member, credit card and mortgage statements, we want to center the statement on the PDFs in eStatements. On print because of the bardcoding on the left margin, the body of the statement is pushed to the right. In eStatements we want the body center on the PDF.
 # Add verbiage **Please retain this final statement for tax purposes** on any close share or loan during the period. See screen below for example. I believe you can use record 498 Closed Share Line and 598 Closed Loan Line to tell if the share/loan was closed during the period.
 # Lessen the spacing between the share summary and totals, and the dividends from last year. Spacing should be consistent for all those items.
