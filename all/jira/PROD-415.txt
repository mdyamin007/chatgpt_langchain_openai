Hey Jun,

Thanks

Forgot to mention. Please put William's Schema as priority if you are doing them separately.

Thanks
David

Hi Jun,

I think we didn't request this originally with you. Because we are going to have only one physical database (i.e. 10.4.24.22) for temporary testing until November 14, 2020; We also would need to include the stage and dev schemas migrated over. The prod schema (i.e 'datatrac') is migrated over and seems to be good, but I just need to have the other DBs migrated over from our dev database into this Brisbane 10.4.24.22 box as well.

Would you be able to prioritize and synch the following schema first:

isparallel
is


DAVID: Can you add include your other schema as well too in this email? I hope you don't mind if I can prioritize my schema first.

Thanks!
