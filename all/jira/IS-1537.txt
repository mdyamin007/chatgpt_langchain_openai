The client just sent over a revised template; please see [^Confirmation Letter_Single (Complianc Final) 09 07 22.docx]

Please update the sow. We will add a new letter 167 and disable 009. 
Letter 167 will have e-statement, paperless suppression and no archival based on the existing one. 

Thanks,
Anwar

comment: Hi [~kdishroon]/[~Igor.Khosid] ,

Here is the sample: [^MFCUDL167.09152022.pdf]
At the bottom right corner, I put the previous letter's layout and document number. 
Confirm with the client if that will change for this.


[~Igor.Khosid], This is a new letter, not sure do you need to test it now or later. 
 But here are the resources:

Thanks,

I get it that the letter uses envelope 4401.
 In preliminary tap test, part of logo is hidden in tap right:

!tap right.png|width=451,height=340!

but any fixing will probably require downscaling the logo a bit since it's almost at the edge in tap left:

!tap left.png|width=460,height=351!

Are we allowed to do that?
 -Also, I'd move the logo up a bit. It was higher back in DL009 letter[^MFCUDL009.pdf](but I don't know, maybe we change this in all recent letters).-


author: JIRAUSER11700
comment: P.S. in my subjective opinion, it would look better if the logo and the return address line had the same width: they are rather close to allowing that.

comment: [~avannik], I just generated both of them from the server, and their position looks exactly the same.

comment: It's negligible, but I'd also change a period after800.500.6328 to a comma. I know it was like that in the mockup, but there should be a comma, and I am an uncurable perfectionist :)


author: JIRAUSER11700
comment: [~anwarh]I see. I probably have an outdated version of MFCUDL009 in QA folder. In any case, the vertical position is ok as it is.


author: JIRAUSER11700
comment: [~kdishroon] I don't see any issues except what I noted above, which may or may not be considered an issue.

If not, ready for the client review.

comment: Hi [~avannik],

Per my zoom message, I believe that is how the letters are currently in production so I am going to send to the client for review.

Thank you,
