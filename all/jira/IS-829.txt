comment: [~sadiqs]: Per my understanding with [~diegof], the live date will depend on parallel passing. I'm updating the live date from 4/11 to 4/19 (Tuesday) so that we do not have past due dates in Jira.

comment: Hi [~gthillaivel]

Would it be possible to ask isd about the application type issue? We used sscuml4 as prefix and in index file we used loanbill as job type.

comment: [~gthillaivel] [~rony] I was just made aware yesterday that this app needs to be under its own loan tab, so I haven't made the updates for this yet. I'll try to make the updates by eod today and will let you know then.

comment: [~Najoa] [~sadiqs] As discussed, please shift OCR in order to match current placement of VISA statements from right edge.

Please provide new DPVS.

In the meantime, I have also created parallel MPT ticket #28737 in preparation for parallel test.

If all is good with DPVS samples tap test once the updates are made, would like to try an initiate parallel test. Please include IS checklist and transfer form.

comment: Hi [~phoebe.george] [~Peter.Dang]

Below is the transfer form. After today we will be off for a week. So onshore may need to involve here to release in prod. Below are the instructions:

[^IS_829_PROGRAM_TRANSFER_FORM.doc]

parallel id:20220310062829

Resources are not in the xfer folder yet, since the parallel is still not done .

Need to add sscuml4 to the paperless file.

Move/home/test/keep/maillist/sscuml4_mail.lis to production.

Need to set cron:

20 08 1,2,3,4,5 . /home/control/daily.control; /home/master/sscuml4_process.sh 1 0 2>&1 >> /d/sscu//sscuml4_today.log

same timing as sscuml3

DSI attached the transfer form before they left as we waited to complete parallel testing.

Please confirm this can be done today due to the number of production files we are holding for SSCU loan bills.

Thanks
