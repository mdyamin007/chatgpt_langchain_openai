*Description:*

There are several applications that still use the legacy AFP2WEB utility. We need to confirm if I've installed all the legacy afp2web utilities correctly on preprocessing02 and to test a handful of clients+manaually.+

*Objectives:*
 * There are 2 or more versions of afp2web command line utilities (afp2web36, afp2web32, etc..); I've identified afp2web32 and afp2web36. I don't+think+ we are using afp2web32. First objective is to have someone analyze all of our existing code and confirm which versions of afp2web we are using on current preprocessing02. Need to document the findings here as this list will serve the purpose when we do the more end-to-end thorough testing between March to mid-May.

 * Manual Unit Testing \{parallel environment}: Please do unit testing by manually copying an input AFP file from current Menlo Preprocessing02 server and try to execute on this server. *NOTE*: I did not create the CIDs in /z/ftpu /z/download/ /z/CID/ /z/daily/ /z/prep/CID /z/pdf_afp
