title: FCBT[pvt][30831]: Enable automated advanced online proofing for print/electronic - LIQ Complex Stmt (lq3)
description: As a permanent solution for L3 30831, configure setting up AOLP for electronic for the below CID's/Applications;

CID's:
CAFC
CTFC
FCBA
ALFC
MILB

Enable electronic AOLP as well for ALL of their LIQ applications:

LIQ Simple Bills
LIQ Simple Statements
LIQ Complex Bills
LIQ Complex Statements
Funds Held
Daily Notices

This will allow for the auto-posting needed to fully automate for these associations to eliminate the manual posting needed on the DP side once print samples are approved.

Note that this should ONLY be done for the above CID's. All other CID's (aside from PLBA which doesn't have AOLP) still have bills generated from their other core.

Enabling/Automation should be for the following:

Print AOLP
Electronic AOLP
Auto-posting
Auto-email trigger

Hi Ricky, could you please have PC create both staging and pilot DT_JOB_IDs for the following cid's:

CAFC
CTFC
FCBA
ALFC

This is for LIQ Complex Statements. Please also ensure that 'eJob Tracking' is turned on for each version.

Thanks,

comment: The above 5 sub-cids have been posted to staging. I have checked to make sure the approval button is visible on InfoTrac UI, and that e-statement is automatically posted. Below are the e-statement index files:

ALFC: lq3_20220701_1_20220926_2357_alfc.txt
 CAFC: lq3_20220701_1_20220926_2359_cafc.txt
 CTFC:lq3_20220701_1_20220927_0001_ctfc.txt
 FCBA:lq3_20220701_1_20220927_0003_fcba.txt
 MILB:lq3_20220825_1_20220926_2033_milb.txt

Holding off on posting to pilot and moving to QA asISD-7728 is currently on hold.
