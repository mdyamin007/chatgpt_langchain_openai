I have checked hypercube and it has support to send *userName* viaSMS as well. Let me know, if we are going to support that for ASFC or not.

Thanks,

Yes, let's go ahead with that feature also.

Thanks,

Do we have Error/success messages for the following scenarios:
 # after successfully sending the Username
 # failed to send the username
 # invalid information

I have updated the error message documentwith the one I'm currently using, you can update the message there and let me know.

Thanks,

Abdullah

Did you commit to pd-tools? I do not think the commit was synced over to the brisbane svn instance. The last commits I see are for the DSO Enrollment. Please re-commit.

Thanks,
Tai
