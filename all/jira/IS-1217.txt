title: FRST - Letter - Dormant Certified MailPDFi Conversion to AFP2PDF Python [InHse]
description: Update existing processing script to no longer use PDFi tool to create pdf.
 Instead use afp2pdf.py program with index_build_multicore option for ALL statement related apps.
 The smaller daily notice jobs can use the current index_build options.

All the zip file, pgp encryption, index file contents, and PDF file naming convention must remain exactly the same original specifications.

Please ensure the standard SOP on the directory structure must be followed: 
 ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/pdf, ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/zip, ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/work is followed.
 Also, clear the folder directory folder before each processing. We do NOT want to accumulate previous runs.

The current program should support checking total PDF counts verification to make sure the expected pdf matches the total number for pdfs generated; If not, incorporate this standard verification logic

DT_JOB_ID:
 133585-C30.01-V21900

Processing Scripts to modify:
 frstdc1_process.sh

Data Files to use:
 "Frst_Checks_091720.csv, Frst_DormantLetter_091720.csv"



*UPDATE*:

Please ensure this script can run on RHS server since this program currently runs on RH2. If there are any errors related to running on RHS server, please report it in this ticket and make the appropriate corrections.

Getting below errorwhile running frstdc1 process in rh2.

Please advise.

Thanks

comment: [~mahbubS]: I'm guessing that is a test system URL hence it is not working via pilot/parallel. As long as the production URL is unchanged (i.e. your code is current and the production URL has not changed), then we can ignore this connection issue. If and when this passes QA, please diff the code to ensure the URL in production is the same as your code (i.e. just want to make sure no one changed the URL while you work working on this project).



I also noticed that this script runs on RH2. Since we are migrating RH2 to RHS server, please remove any associate logic that is hard coded to RH2. Please also regress test all options to make sure it is compatible with RHS server. If there any issues, please report via this ticket and report what was fixed. Description of work has been updated.

comment: Hi [~William.Kong],

In the processing script i can only see hardcoded rh2 at the beginning of the main function.

I will update it to rhs and run the script in rhs and let you know the impediments I face in the way.

Thanks

comment: Hi [~William.Kong],

I commented out the rh2 part in script. The same Walz issue is happening if I run in rhs.

And i can see in production code no archival index file created and in SOW nothing is mentioned about archival index.

Thanks

comment: Hi[~William.Kong],

The updates are done.

Ran the process in rhs2 using data file "Frst_Checks_091720.csv" and "Frst_DormantLetter_091720.csv".

Sample is at:/z/pdf_afp/frst/frstdc1/zip/frst_DormantLetter_07152022_1.zip

Please check.

Thanks


author: william.kong
comment: [~mahbubS]: Per instructions above, please run using *RHS* server instead of RHS2. The Papyrus version on RHS2 is different compared to RHS & RH2.



In addition, please use a more current production cycle data file so that we can compare the production version vs parallel content via afpcompare and pdf_compare.



I've made a backup copy of the PDF archival files from production



Please use the following Production Cycle 7/15:

[williamK@rhs2 util]$ /home/test/util/get_processed_filename.pl frst 2409043
 cid: frst
 jid: dc1
 proc_id 2409043
 file_name: Frst_Checks_071522.csv

 file_name: Frst_DormantLetter_071522.csv
 md5 6f3dcce6bfefcaa2605a8185842a027f





I've made a copy of these data files in:/d/ac-secure-share/dsi_print/mahbubS/is-1217/
