For print samples:
 * TEST ENVIRONMENT
 * FILENAME: cambdla2184.2o1.afp, cambdla218.sam.afp
 * IMAGE RANGE for cambdla2184.2o1.afp: 1-3, 15, 109, 110, 131, 145, 227, 593, 595-596, 599-600, 605-606, 613-614, 619-620, 652-654
 * IMAGE RANGE for cambdla218.sam.afp: 75, 84, 110
 * TRAY 1 STOCK: 4000

Note that print samples are requested from cambdla218.sam.afp as letters 12 and 19 as they are found here but not in cambdla2184.2o1.afp. Accounts for letter 12 are most likely designated for non-print/estatement/non-estatement, while letter 19 only creates PDF. Also note that letters 14 and 15 are discontinued.
