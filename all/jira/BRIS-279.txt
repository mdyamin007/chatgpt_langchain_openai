title: wrapperservice URL fixing and docker volume mounting issue
description: from wrapper-pr-01/02 afp2web port 9040 was not accessible. so, removed the 3 part property to one property from wrapper which is afp2web-base-url.

I've changed the URL for afp2web url in wrapperservice.properties
the previous protocol:host:port has been changed to base-url
{{afp2web.afp2web-base-url=}}{{[https://afp2web-common.infoimageinc.com|https://afp2web-common.infoimageinc.com/]}}
So, now we don't need access to any other ports as it's using the default HTTPS (443) port which is already open. the latest codebase has been commited into gitlab master branch
