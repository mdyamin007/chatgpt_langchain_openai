title: Generic Temporary Windows File Server 
description: +*Summary:*+

Per Kent, there are several servers that we plan to+physically+ move over from Menlo to Brisbane during the live weekend cutoff period. In order for IS & ISD to continue testing the Brisbane server environment, Network can create a generic "single" file server that will+temporarily+ replace all the "windows based" file servers.

e.g.:

infoftp

infoftp2

infoftps3

dell-2100

lanieradmin

etc.



*Specifications:*
 * Setup 1 Server ONLY:
 * OS: Windows 2016 Datacenter
 * CPU: 2
 * Memory: 4GB
 * Disk Size: 250GB for now (subject to change/increase as we test);



Once completed, please share with us via email this+temporary+ IP address. IS and ISD will be responsible for creating the folders to replace the servers listed above.
