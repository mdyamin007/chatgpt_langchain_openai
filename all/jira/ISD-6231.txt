comment: Hi [~Tin.Chak]

I am not sure who is assgined , so I am just including you.

Would you please post this index file cc1_20211017_1_20220304_0547_sscu.txt to pilot.

[^SSCUCC1.zip]has all the resources.



One thing to let you know. While pdf conversion transparent flag(PKEY="TRANSPARENT") needs to be on in the configuration.

Thanks

comment: [~rony] I uploaded resources onto pilot, but I'm not able to post the index file onto pilot. I receive this error: "infoTrac_flag is on but dt_job_id is missing from dataTrac(IS) database". Can you double check if everything is updated properly in the IS database?

comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] Can you assist to post the new index file from DSI-IS in previous comment. Please keep previous posting up as well, as they are two different cycles.

Please update resources also when possible, as we are using a new logo, replacing previous resources provided. Thanks!

I'll update the ISD Jira story also.

comment: [~phoebe.george] Per Ruman's comment, I've updated the resources and posted the latest index file. There's only 1 file posted on pilot because there were issues posting the first file, cc1_20211017_1_20220304_0547_sscu.txt. If that one needs to be posted, then I think I need assistance from IS per my previous comment.

comment: [~rony] [~Shun.Kuwashima] Igor and I re-checked on staging this morning and it looks good on our end too, we don't see the grey bar.

No additional research is needed. Thank you!
