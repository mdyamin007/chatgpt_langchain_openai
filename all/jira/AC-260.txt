title: SNFB - [22823][pvt] DP / SNFB Report Upload Error on PUI
description: Expected Live Date is27/Oct/21 for this internal change.

Details



The Missing Product Code Report does not generate any report if there are no errors. However, we are going to make an update so that the report is always generated, but inside there will be a message like "No Error Occurred." That way it is clear that no errors occurred and not because some bug caused the report generation to fail.



This change will also fix the issue reported by DP, since the Report Uploader is looking for the file and results in error when no file is found.
