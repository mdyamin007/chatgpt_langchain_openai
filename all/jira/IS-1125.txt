comment: [~rony] Sorry for the delay, waiting for ISD to update in pilot as well for customer to test. I will need to shift the live date slightly. Thanks!

DSI, in talking SUCU, we will not be going live with this after EOM. I'm pending confirmation from client and we will update the ticket due date once confirmed. But it will not require release for this EOM, but shortly after so we have enough time before next EOM.

What is the plan for the due date?


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~rony] [~sadiqs] We are holding a pilot site review/training with SUCU on 6/13/22. Once training is completed, we will be able to move forward with QA/release. 
Let me know if okay to update the due date to 6/20/22.

[~Juliana Vannik] Once DSI confirms a new live date of 6/20, please update due date on the story and epic, as well as informing Eric of the updated due date on the ISD story.

Thanks!

comment: [~rony] [~sadiqs] We completed the pilot site training for the customer yesterday. The only thing that was noticed in the pilot site is that 'Application ID' was not appearing. Is that just due to being in pilot site?

If that is controlled by PC, then we can move forward and I'll ensure they update it for production for the launch.

[~eric.yan] FYI

[~Juliana Vannik] - please update Epic status to APPROVED. Thanks!

I am not quite sure but possibly controlled by pc.



Thanks

comment: Hi [~phoebe.george]

Can we go for release?


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~rony] Does this require parallel test? I wasn't sure if this was a configuration or programming update that requires parallel testing and/or QA. 

[~eric.yan] [~Juliana Vannik] FYI


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~rony] I talked to Igor, and this should go through QA. Can you prepare? Thanks!

[~Igor.Khosid] [~Juliana Vannik] FYI. Thanks!
