*App:*Adverse Action Notice

*Description:*if type column value ( the last column in the data file ) is not present for a customer, suppress it from print, enotice, archvial.

And also below scenario can happen too in data file where.The last column which is the type column can go into next line alone. In the above example for line 16 suppress the account since it has type field missing and don't even call print_doc for line 17 ( if a line has only one | ) .

Would it be possible to ask the client to provide a sample data file name for this?

Previously there were errors in output for these entries as there were no 'type' fields for 16 and 17 lines. Now they are suppressed fromprint, enotice and archival.

They are also suppressed if the 'type' field is empty.

Therefore there is no output in pdf for these entries.

comment: Working as expected.
 Every time I edit data file so that Type field value is missing, the document is not generated in Papyrus.
Ready for the client approval.

As the project is about suppressing accounts for invalid data, it will be enough not to provide the index file and DPVS.
