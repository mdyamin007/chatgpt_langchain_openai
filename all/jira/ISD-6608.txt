Hi Stephen, I have attached a sample report which you can show the client.[^bkpl_ms2_undeliverable_1_03162022_172413.csv]

Also, what is the frequency on when they want the bounceBacks?


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~mac]- Monthly please. After the EOM statements have been processed. Let me get approval of the format.

comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]

Hi Stephen. Format:*CIF NUMBER|EMAIL ADDRESS|CODE|REASON|DATE*

Also, can we have the bounceBack ran on the 12th of every month, since that's when most of our bounceBack jobs run?


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~mac]- Yes that is fine. Still waiting for approval. Will follow up with the bank.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: Hi [~mac]- 1 update and 1 question.

Update - Please update format to be:SSN/TIN|EMAIL ADDRESS|CODE|REASON|DATE

Question - Once this has been rolled out, can we run a bounceback report on all of their past EOM cycles to get the bouceback info?

Hi Stephen, yes I can update the format to that.

Also, we can run a bounceBack report for all their past EOM cycles, which date do we go back to to start collecting from?


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~mac]- We went LIVE at the end of Nov, and they have 1 big cycle at the end of every month. So assuming we go LIVE in early April, there will be 5 cycles. Will that be ok?

Verified bounce back report for undeliverable emails on staging PUI, it generated correctly.

Thank you,

comment: Thank you [~nprimak]! [~mac]- No parallel right? Please confirm rollout.

Hi Stephen,

No, there is no parallel. I will rollout tomorrow. I have some final questions before I do so.
 # Does the client want the report encrypted? If so, we have two types of encryption.
 ## pgp, client will need to provide a recipient (email address)
 ## zip,client will need to provide a zip code
 # Does the client want a confirmation email sent out?
 ## Client will need to provide a recipient (email address).

Hi Stephen,

*An update on this.* When I am trying to generate the report for the past 5 cycles on production, there are issues.

The issue is that the report is retrieving the the api email jobs for those cycles, but they are coming up as failed. This is an issue that I'm having DSI look into as they are the ones to ask about the API stuff. So, the release of this will be delay until the issue is resolved.

Thanks,

Mac

Hi Stephen,

It has been released to production. I have also ran the report for the past 5 cycles. It has been dropped off into the *client's pick up folder,* and an email has been sent out to *InfoIMAGE@bankplus.net*.

*FYI.* I also had to use the default address (*data_center@infoimageinc.com*) as the encryption as yours didn't seem to work.
