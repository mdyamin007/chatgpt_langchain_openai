comment: Looked at the usr_session table sso dates:
Realized that the reason why there were so few users that were enrolled, is because by rerunning the pre-enrollment script on 12/1 or 12/2, and the logic of the script making every user have to go through enrollment steps, rather than set them as pre-enrolled, users who had delivery preference set to Electronic inside the pre-enrollment file they provided to us got reset to have to go through enrollment steps once more.
