Client approved samples 11/24/21


author: tanmay
comment: [~jharvey]can you provide a data file that contains these 4 letters.


author: william.kong
comment: [~jharvey]: I cannot file data file for letter code 94. Can APCU send us a test file for this scenario?



[~tanmay]: I can only locate data for 91, 92, 93

I've copied the following files into:/z/infoftp_int/jha/apcu/dn/ which will be scanned into /z/ftpbu/jhabu folder:

apcu_dn_110321_1.zip.pgp

apcu_dn_111321_1.zip.pgp



Both these cycles have 91

However, 92 and 93 are in separate cycles above.






author: tanmay
comment: [~jharvey]any update for the data file, once we get the data file we will request for QA. If there none we can use data file for 094 from QA project folder. let us know .

The client provided the file I attached here as a sample data file. They have not generated any letters for 094 due to them being annually. Please let me know if you need anything additional.[^Annual_Donation_Notice_NOTICE1]

comment: [~jharvey]any updates? From TS24636 i guess it has been passed. should we release to production.


author: jharvey
comment: [~tanmay]

I sent the Master Parallel ticket to you with Ready to Release status in Team Support. Would it be better to comment here that we are ready to release code instead of sending you the ticket?

We are good to release whenever you are ready.

comment: [~TunA] [~William.Kong] [~jharvey] 
 Transfer form has been attached. Resources have been placed at/d/is/cvs/xfer/mahbuburT/ . please proceed to production.

[~jharvey] i guess it would be better to comment here once Jira ticket gets created to maintain a single thread and change the status(i guess there is none like pending_go_live, but we can create). However if you change the status of teamsupport , please reassign us and change the group as well so that we get notification.

comment: [~tanmay]: According to the comment above, Tun released the code. Please update your hours in this ticket and mark status "Done"


author: william.kong
comment: [~tanmay]: Can you please review TS# 24128 that [~TunA] mentioned.. Unfortunately, DP does not have Jira license yet so they cannot report the issue here.



[https://app.na3.teamsupport.com/?TicketNumber=24128]



There seem so to be a processing error in parallel from your latest release. Please do not mark this project "Done" yet, until this issue is resolved.
