This is to split application prefix ea1 under mortgage to the new statement type.

comment: Hi [~dyuen],

Today was the live date. Since we have not got approval from pilot, we could not deploy this on production.


author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~jahid.hasan], I'm still pending approval from IDCU. I followed up and the Jira dates have been adjusted.

Thanks

comment: [~jahid.hasan] [~rifat.mahmud]from IDCU:

When will we see the application breakout in Pilot? We want to confirm that Alkami has correctly coded things on their side for eBranch presentment before we promote this to production.


author: 5b1ee5a72eea651bacdeca2e
comment: This is a question from the client:

Can you confirm that this is in its own separate tab? I see that it has its own email template.


author: JIRAUSER11102
comment: Yess, [~Tin.Chak]. Statements wil be shown on seperate tab based on stmt_type=escrow. And it has it's own email template as well.

[~dyuen], We have posted 3 accounts on pilot db by copying previous ea1 prefixed index file with stmt_type=escrow. These account numbers are7671443, 11586971, 12066063 (all with closing date2020-05-22). You can find escrow statements for these accounts under under 'Escrow Analysis Statement' tab. You as well as Alkami can check those accounts.

comment: Thank you [~jahid.hasan], IDCU has been notified. Pending approval/response.


author: dyuen
comment: [~jahid.hasan], per IDCU: "Will you please post the last MTG statement to Pilot? We need to have this in Pilot so we can verify Alkami has their coding correct in the staging environment."

Please confirm once complete/posted.

Thanks

comment: Hi [~dyuen],

I have posted statements into pilot from index file name 'ea1_20220520_1_20220524_1124_idcu.txt' which was the last ea1 prefix mortgage in production. So, IDCU can check those accounts now.

comment: Hi [~dyuen],

I didn't find any index file inside 'IDCU_EA_STMT_072122.7z.gpg' . I found 3 files here:IDCU_CrossRef_05242022.txt,IDCU_EA_STMT_052422.stm,IDCU_PERM_052422.txt. Can you provide me the index file name? Or can you provide me the DT_job_id or Ref # of the cycle in PROD?



Thanks,

Jahid

comment: Hi [~jahid.hasan], I don't know the index filename, but here is the PROD cycle from last month.
