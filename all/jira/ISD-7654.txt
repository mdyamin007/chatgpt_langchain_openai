The following updates are done and deployed on Pilot -
 # Logo update.
 # Right sided disclosure update with new link and new toll free number (see epcu_screenshot_1).
 # Enrollment step 1 disclosure verbiage updated (see epcu_screenshot_2).
 # Enrollment step 2 sample pdf is updated with the attached pdf (see epcu_screenshot_3).

Please advice on the followings -
 # I am not sure if the copyright verbiage at the bottom of the site needs update or not. It currently showing El Paso Area Teaches Credit Union.
 # The_eStatement Disclosure_ button at the bottom of the right sided disclosure on the home page, shows a pdf with TFCU logo on it. I think this pdf should be updated with the new logo.

Here are the urls that you will need to do sso to EPCU pilot.

ssoKeyGen: [https://epcupilot.infoimageinc.com/ssoKeyGen]
ssoExchange: [https://epcupilot.infoimageinc.com/ssoExchange]

You can use client test page [http://client-test.infoimageinc.com/sso/]

Hit heartbeat url to check if the service is up and running: [https://epcupilot.infoimageinc.com/heartbeat]

comment: Hi Azhar, I get an invalid request error when trying to access


author: azad
comment: [~MattL]

First go to client test page and search for EPCU. Select "Hypercube" on application drop-down and also click on "Pilot" as environment. You will get a form where you can provide the account number that you wish to do sso for.

Provide the account number and click on 1st submit button. You will be provided an encrypted data.

Take the data and use it to fill up the 2nd form's data input field. Provide an email and hit the 2nd submit button. You will be provided with an encrypted ssoKey. This step is called ssoKeyGen.

Take the ssoKey and use it to fille the 3rd form's ssoKey data input field. Hit the 3rd submit button and if all is well, you will see the EPCU customer site on a new tab of your browser.

I hope this helps.

fyi [~Tin.Chak]

Thanks

comment: [~MattL] The client go to the Online Banking and they will use the ssoKeyGen and ssoExchnage URL to setup a test site. If the CU doesn't want to get the Online Banking vendor involved, we can provide screenshot of the change instead.

comment: [~Azad]if we need to push the release back one week we can. Customer took a long time deciding that they wanted screen shots.




author: azad
comment: [~MattL]

Yes, we need to push the release back a few days . As the requirements get changed after Stage testing completed, we need to go through the development-testing phase again from Pilot to Stage to make everything right up to client's new requirements. Also, we need time to get client approvals for new changes on Pilot.

We have a release date fixed for Meteor 2.5 update for Hypercube on October 12th. It would be better if this changes go with this release. [~Tin.Chak]please advice.

*epcu_stage_home_page_disclosure.png*
 # 'at chat.raiz.us' is replaced with 'at [www.raiz.us'|http://www.raiz.us%27/]
 # Link url is pointed to '[https://www.raiz.us/']
 # Toll-free number is removed.



*Request to change color from hunter-green to raiz-blue*

EPCU requested to change the hunter-green color to raiz-blue on just two places (page headers on enrollment step 1 and 2). Hunter-green was used as an accent color previously. So this color is used on multiple pages on multiple components. I think as EPCU is rebranded to raiz, we should change the hunter-green to raiz-blue on all over the site. I've attached some screenshots that displays how the site will look like after this color update.
 * Enrollment step 1: [^epcu_new_enrollment_step1.png]
 * Enrollment step 2: [^epcu_new_enrollment_step2.png]
 * Enrollment step 3: [^epcu_new_enrollment_step3.png]
 * Home page: [^epcu_new_home.png]
 * Profile page: [^epcu_new_profile.png]

Please take a look and provide me the client's feedback about those changes.

*Clients Feedback:*

For the edits: on #3 - I meant to only remove the words "toll-free" since that number listed wasn't a toll-free number, but we still needed to have the phone number listed. Can you please add it back in?

*Release date:*

Client is talking to their management team to see if oct 12 is okay.

New url is updated in epcu proxy config (proxy-pr-17/18). The following line is changed:
{code:java}
server_name estatements.raiz.us epcuprod.infoimageinc.com;{code}
I checked the heartbeat and found OK status.
{code:java}
GET https://estatements.raiz.us/heartbeat

{
    "service":"OK"
}
{code}
Let me know if SSL cert updated. We may close the ticket then if everything works fine.
