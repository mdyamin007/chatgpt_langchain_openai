comment: [~rukmaniR]: This is the project I mentioned to last Thursday that it is on it's way. Please review this ticket to update the signature on each of the DFAs.



I've copied some recent cycles if you need current data files to test:

Here is all the zip files where you can gather example data for each of these letter codes. I've temporarily placed them into/d/iss/willK/sscu/TS25136/ for ease of access.
