Could you instruct DP to run SEFC EA1 in parallel to test the AOLP and autopost?

comment: Rogelio got following issue inTicket #22971 comment #14, "Processing is done but it only showed PRINT, no estatement entry in Infotrac."



Hi [~eric.yan], For some reason, Rogelio assigned ticket 22971 back to you, even though you stated that "please reach out to ISD for help. Maybe some flag needs to be turned on.".

Can you please assign to ISD? You might need to provide information for ESTMT_DT and ESTMT_PROC tables to ISD.

Thanks,

Tun
