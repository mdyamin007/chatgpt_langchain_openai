 dlc does not have the IMB under the address. It is also noted in description.

But it has this on the top of the letter.

Ops has confirmed that this application cannot be setup for ACS due to it not having an IMB.  Please change the endorsement to "Return Service Requested" and the return mail address needs to be updated to:
Shell Federal Credit Union
PO Box 578
Deer Park, Tx 77536

We will need to send this back through QA and parallel before releasing.

For dlc, I didn't update the endorsement.
and you can see the endorsement is "Return Service Requested" on the sample.[^sheldlc_sample.pdf]
