comment: Can you help me trouble shoot why the message is not showing. It should appear where the orange box appears in the photo.[https://app.na3.teamsupport.com/dc/1/attachments/9229083]



I was able to do this on demo cid on pilot. I added verbiage.html to ELCU's public/assets/resource/ folder but the message isn't showing.

comment: Hi [~Patric K],

Seems like you have missed a flag for this feature named "*bannerVerbiage*". I have enabled this flag and commit this code on the trunk. And it's working now. Let me know if it's working for you.



Thanks,
