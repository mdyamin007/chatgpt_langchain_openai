description: Similar to Phoebe's email ask Trisha what her groups process is when signing up a client for color message manager. Is there a question sheet they send to the client to have filled out....

Specific questions that they ask etc.

comment: Per Trisha:

As of today, there is no form. The only question is if they are running ran on the color printer. Which is not a question for the client but something we need to know before starting discussions and what version of MM they are onagain not a question for the client.

Once IS starts turning this feature on for a few clients, Im sure they will come back with more questions.
