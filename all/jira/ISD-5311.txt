They would like to target to go live by EOM and send the first production file as of 10/29/21.

Can you confirm the final file name they should use in production and I'll update the SOW as well. Thank you!

In the enrollment files that was processed on production, the files hasn't been processing since 11/10 because there seems to be an additional column added.
