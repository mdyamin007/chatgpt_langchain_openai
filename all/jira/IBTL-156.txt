comment: [~William.Kong] I tried scanning BANB DDA #15 into datatrac but got the message below which usually indicates that a docket wasn't 'fully prepped' meaning PC has to print the docket or something like that.

comment: [~Terrence.Tong]: can you review Neil's response above to confirm the error message is accurate and that we need PC to print the docket? If so, can you help me coordinate this with PC department?

comment: Kent,

I tested the port 10.5.20.39 -> 3491 from 10.4.20.31 and it works.

But IP 10.4.32.166 (DataTrac Jump station) cannot access this port.

Is subnet 10.4.32.* belongs to office? Can you grant access to 10.5.20.39 -> 3491
