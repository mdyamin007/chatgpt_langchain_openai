It's ok to add header to the data file, the client just need to send test file with the header and I could make update to accommodate it. (program hour: 1 hour)
In order to use a different paragraph for "Counter" status, please ask the client to send a pdf template with the changed text along with other contents. I'll convert and fit it to the current template. The pdf needs to be 300 dpi. (program hour: 4 hours)

comment: Client updated (ticket 22598 comment #15):



Unfortunately, there was a new discussion with our attorneys and they advised us to NOT move forward with the "COUNTER" letter change.

Apologies about this change while it's already being worked on, but we can't move forward.



With that said we still want to make adjustments to add in headers. I have added a sample for the Risk Based Pricing letters to go along with the AA letters.

Please let me know if you have any questions, or need anything else from me at the moment.

comment: no parallel or QA needed, as no formatting or processing logic is changed.
