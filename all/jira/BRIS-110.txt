comment: [~premraj.patil]: What is the status on this VM? We need to get this as early as today and no later then tomorrow as it is past due. The USB dongle from ISIS Papyrus is arriving on Monday. I need Ernest to install the "Papyrus Desktop" authentication client software after you get this VM installed. Please advise status. If it is completed, please assign to Ernest. 



Thanks!
