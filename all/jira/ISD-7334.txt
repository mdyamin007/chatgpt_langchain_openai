comment: Hi [~rukmaniR]

Could you test the print selective insert in your next run, I've enabled the electronic selective insert and wanna see if it works.


author: JIRAUSER11100
comment: [~eric.yan] - I talked to Peter about it. He said this request has to come from [~Ricky Lopez], he has to initiate a campaign with PC.

comment: [~rukmaniR] [~eric.yan] Please provide some account numbers that the bank can check on the pilot site.

We are not able to access the pilot Admin for some reason, so we can't verify if the account #'s pulled from the pilot PUI are actually loaded and we are checking the correct cycle. EWBB is requesting a few account numbers to check on pilot for validation. Thank you!

comment: This story is related to IS-1299.
Testing is now suspended.


author: JIRAUSER11400
comment: [~rukmaniR]can your additional testing be completed by Tuesday? The first FIS production file will be arriving on 9/8.

[~Andrey.Kutsenko]can QA be continued while Rukmani is still continuing to test so we do not lose additional time?


author: JIRAUSER11100
comment: [~Ricky Lopez] - Testing in parallel is suspended due to month end. I can test only on Tuesday and it'll be completed by Wednesday. Can you please add the folder specs to the ticket? We are changing the folder to /d/ewbb/priority so that it doesn't get overwritten by the dda process.

Thanks!
Rukmani


author: JIRAUSER11400
comment: Hi [~rukmaniR]-could you specify which folder, is it our internal folder FTPBU?


author: JIRAUSER11100
comment: [~Ricky Lopez] - It's the processing folder. For dda the data file gets decrypted to  /d/ewbb/stmt  and for priority we are changing it to /d/ewbb/priority.

Thanks!


author: JIRAUSER11400
comment: Hi [~rukmaniR]- EWBB/FIS will not be changing where they transmit the production files, this update is internal only.




author: JIRAUSER11100
comment: [~Ricky Lopez] - I'm not changing the bu folder path. It's only the processing folder path that is changed like Velo has its own processing folder.


author: JIRAUSER11104
comment: QA is completed.
Selective insert posted.
