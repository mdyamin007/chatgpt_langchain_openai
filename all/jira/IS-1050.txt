[~zhuoxinT]has concern for file naming convention.

Can you please confirm with client if they can send with following naming convention for production files?
 - Data file naming convention: WFCUDL1.mmdd.zip.pgp -> dqmortgages.MMDD



Thanks,

Tun






author: JIRAUSER10911
comment: [~zhuoxinT] [~TunA] 

I am confirming with the client.


author: JIRAUSER10911
comment: [~zhuoxinT] [~TunA] 

Client confirms naming provided will be used in production.


author: JIRAUSER10911
comment: [~zhuoxinT] [~TunA] 

Where should they send the data file too?


author: JIRAUSER11101
comment: [~Kbittmann]
it should be come with their daily letter file.
 - Data file naming convention: WFCUDL1.mmdd.zip.pgp -> dqmortgages.MMDD


author: JIRAUSER10911
comment: [~zhuoxinT]

Per the client:

Ok, I reviewed this with our programming team again. They do not want to include these test letters/data with the daily letter file. We want to send it in a separate file.

The reason for this is the daily letter file includes several letters. If for any reason, there's a problem with any of these, it will stop the other letters from being sent to you all.


author: JIRAUSER11101
comment: [~Kbittmann],

for testing, they can just sent dqmortgages.MMDD to the test folder.

But when it is live. thisdqmortgages.MMDD has to come with other letters inWFCUDL1.mmdd.zip.pgp.


author: JIRAUSER10911
comment: [~zhuoxinT]

I don't think they want to send it that way in production as well. If they want to send it separate does it have to be a separate application?


author: tuna
comment: [~Kbittmann],

If the client do not want to send production file with following naming convention, how do the client want to send data file?
 - Data file naming convention: WFCUDL1.mmdd.zip.pgp -> dqmortgages.MMDD



Can client send data file as follow? I see a few existing notice with separate encrypted files, If yes, we don't need to setup as new applicaton. Setting up new application need higher programming hours and longer timeline.
 - Data file naming convention:: dqmortgages.MMDD.pgp



*Please confirm to* [~zhuoxinT]*, Also, need to update SOW.*



Thanks,

Tun

Client feedback below:

Sorry, I think the issue is we don't want this "Test Data/File" to be accidently comingled with the live production data/files.

But from what you are saying if we put the exact nameing convetion of: WFCUDL1.mmdd.zip.pgp -> dqmortgages.MMDD it will not be accidently put together with our live data file right?


author: JIRAUSER11101
comment: [~Kbittmann],

Right, for testing: If client put it in test folder. That will not impact the production.

In the future, they can choose to do either one of following options when it's live:
1. sent the dqmortgages with other daily letter files: WFCUDL1.mmdd.zip.pgp -> dqmortgages.MMDD
2. encrypt and sent it separately: dqmortgages.MMDD.pgp

comment: [~zhuoxinT]

Please see the below client feedback.

We are needing archive/PDF copies of the notices that are sent out. Can we use the previous file we sent you when we were requesting samples for testing purpose, so our team can correctly configure our imagining system to pick them up?

In addition, they would like samples provided on Info Trac.




author: JIRAUSER11101
comment: [~Kbittmann] 
I can add the archival/PDF option for this letter.
the pdf filename will be:WFCU_DQM_\{loan_id}_\{seq_num}.pdf =>WFCU_DQM_5797_35.pdf
index filename:WFCU_DQM_index_\{proc_date}-\{segment_num}.txt =>WFCU_DQM_index_06092022-1.txt

And these files will be zipped up and dropped to client pick_up folder. => /infoftps4/wfcu/client_pickup

I will run the process on Pilot today, will let you know when its done. So client can view the sample on Info Trac.

Thanks

I am only adding this letter to the existing archival process. That being said I use the same zip file name as what we have on production now. It'sWFCU_Adv_Letter_\{proc_date}_\{segment_num}.zip
as well as the description: account name|loan_num|SSN(if available in data file)|pdf filename
