description: BKPL Christmas Club Accounts Fix

Update composition program for BKPLMS21.dfa to translate Account Type 'X' to Account Type 'S'.

On the eStatement platform, ISD will need to create a query to convert all existing posted statements with an Account Type 'X' to Account Type 'S'

comment: [~anwarh]/[~mahbubS]: Anwar, per the last minute zoom chat. Please see if Sakib can assist on this RUSH hot fix tonight (which your Thursday morning). If so, I would like [~yameelee]to do code review tomorrow morning and release it as a hot fix.



I'm going to places the converted data file in your/t/mahbubS/bkplms2.dat.zip; It's real big. It will have some examples of the Account Type X for your testing.



Network team was able to recover the original file as well. I've placed it in your /t/mahbubS/ folder. Once you are done with this project, please delete the files to save on storage.

Once completed, please alert [~tai.trinh]so he can perform his one-time query update on the old estatement docs that have account type 'X' to 'S'.
