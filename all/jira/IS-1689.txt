An additional update has been made to cambms3.control in order to process this job.The variable mail_full_serv has been changed to "ESR1" from "ASE3". This was originally supposed to be part of the CAMB return mail conversion project, but the story IS-1391 was cancelled because this job is e-statement only. However, this update still needs to be made in order to successfully process.

Please review.

Thanks!
