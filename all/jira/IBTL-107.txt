comment: [~lemoy28]: Can you help me verify this issue? Is it because message manager folder missing from /d/isd_input/I3/MsgMgr/

If not, please advise what the issue is. Thanks!



[~Terrence.Tong]: FYI.

comment: Will,

I think the script/home/master/get_msg_v2_cu_std_prod.pl would need to be updated for the brisbane server.

Below are the urls for message manager pui in Menlo, so we need to check with ISD

comment: [~lemoy28]: Can you double check again? I manually did a curl command to test the site and it is responding:

comment: [~lemoy28]: Going to re-assign it back to Ernest. I think the issue is with the pseg convert again. This time it crashed and has a segmentation fault.



[~ernestw]: Can you review why pseg converter is constantly throwing a segmentation fault?

/ is at 100%. Nothing wrong with pseg conversion

comment: [~ernestw]: Thanks for helping on this.

[~premraj.patil]: Thanks for expanding the root partition from 246GB to 4TB

[~lemoy28]: FYI. That was the root cause of the issue, i think.

[~cesarg]: Can you retest?
