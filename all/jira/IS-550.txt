title: UFCU - Update to Archival for Daily Notices
description: *Parallel Requirement*: No



From Diego:
 The use of the xfer file is new only to monthly statements. For other applications you will simply need to pull the last fields(along with the other items we already pull from xfer) which are new in the xfer file Field 21 == email address and 22 = SalesforceID

This changes the index we output from:

DocCode,MemberNum,MemberName,StatementDate, path/filename,statement name,delivery preference,YES

TO:

DocCode,MemberNum,MemberName,StatementDate, path/filename,statement name,delivery preference,YES,email,SalesforceID

For monthly statement we will need to read in the file and match up the account number to field1 of the xfer and pull those 2 fields above.

Just confirming now the actual order of the 2 new fields on index but i believe the order on their end can be set to what we provide. just wanted to add some information now.

Hi [~tanmay]- please be sure to provide all information to start QA!!

DO not just changed the status to QA.

QA failed the story!!

Returning back to "In Progress" I'll fail all other stories as well without information needed for QA to star testing

QA is completed, the Index file output changed to:



DocCode,MemberNum,MemberName,StatementDate, path/filename,statement name,delivery preference,YES,email,SalesforceID



Please attach IS checklist if needed.


author: william.kong
comment: [~tanmay]: *Please submit code transfer form for now*. [~andreav]is pending when the other UFCU parallel is going to be completed so I don't know what "Due Date" to update on this ticket. I think client wants all changes for all UFCU related projects to be released together.



For now, I will mark Monday, Dec 6, 2022. Do NOT release code on that day unless [~andreav]+explicitly+ asked you to. For now, I will not change status from "QA Completed" to "Release Ready"


author: andreav
comment: I am checking if a code release date of 12/7 will work for the client. In the meantime, please provide the information needed for IS managers to roll out the code when needed.


author: tanmay
comment: [~berezinez]IS checklist has been attached.
[~William.Kong]okay, once [~andreav]confirmed we will ask for code release
