title: PFCU - [22871][pvt] Develop method to keep email addresses current in InfoIMAGE
description: The columns needed for the auth file will be - cif | usrname | acctname | acctnum | accttype | firstname | middlname | lastname | acct_restriction | nickname | email | delivery preference | notification preference

(difference is adding email column, delivery preference column, and notification preference column at the end)



So the valid values to pass in for delivery preference field are: "P", "E", or "W" (P for paper, E for electronic, W for both). Keep the letters capital.

The valid values to pass in for notification preference are: "email" (just keep it as email for all records)



Here's an example record taken from the first line of the sample file the client provided:

21|JOHN BEMENT|JOHN BEMENT|14857928|00|JOHN||BEMENT|0|Savings|jdbement@statestreet.com|E|email

Here is client's feedback:

" please see further down in the Ticket, we already agreed to just add the email to the end of the existing daily CIF. We have programmed to those specs and sent a test file for that back a couple months ago. We are hoping to continue on with that method if possible."

comment: Hi [~dawnl],

I've tested the sample file the client provided onto the pilot environment. It ran successfully. Let's have the client check the updates on InfoTRAC pilot to confirm they see that the emails were updated correctly.



Thank you

Will there be a new directory for the ECL file on the FTP that we should send these files? See below for client's feedback

"While the team reviews the pilot changes, we can start planning for the automation to send that file each day with the CIF. Will there be a new directory for the ECL file on the FTP that we should send these files? Thanks, Dan"

Thanks.

More questions from client

"FYI - our automation is in place and I am presently sending the ECL file into the Test FTP folder for now. Is it possible to run the latest file against your production system and send us a report of emails that 'would be' changed, but not actually change them? That may be a better way for us to validate the process."

comment: Hi [~Ethan.Yu],

Here is more feedback from client:

"So far so good with the internal review today. If we treat our ECL as a full-file where it will cause email addresses to be deleted from II:

1) Is there some sort of validation or threshold that if posting that particular ECL file would impact more than x% of the records, the file would be held for review? (I think there is something similar in place for the CIF)

2) If an email record for an account/statement no longer exists in our file and an email exists at II:

 a) Does it just remove the emails for any accounts at II that are not listed in the file?

 b) Does it cause those statements to flip back to paper?

 c) Does it reset or do anything else to the profile for that statement?

"

Can you answer client's question below:

"We have completed our review of the latest ECL file and everything looks good. We will plan to start sending our files over on 9/14. If something changes and we can start sending the file sooner, just let me know. Also, is there any ECL processing report that will show up somewhere when it processes these files each day?"
