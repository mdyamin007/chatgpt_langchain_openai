title: 12584 / 44852 - FCBA / FCBT - Setup Hypercube Site
description: InfoTRAC/PUI already set up. We only need to set up hypercube.

Setup electronic/SSO customer site for "FCBT" accounts (which is also the parent account).

The CID would be FCBA.

Although we already have data files coming through and we only post to InfoTrac, the bank would like to have its own eStatement site.

All specifications to mirror existing TXFC eStatement site for branding and color.

Bank name = Capital Markets Group

Pilot info from ISD for Q2 SSO setup provided:
