title: Setup New Email Schedule
description: Add two new schedule configuration for automated email time. This is the class to update:

com.infoimage.processing.application.email.RunJobs

One of the new schedule time will be for EWBB, and the other for MFCU. Create a bat file that can trigger the new scheduled email job.

I have committed the code to staging and production. Schedule files are also committed.

You just have to trigger auto_email_ewbb.bat and auto_email_mfcu.bat from Crontab.

Thanks.
