title: VPN Palo Alto Client Update (1st Batch)
description: Hi Ferhat,

In discussing with Kent, he mentioned he spoke with you earlier today. I have now 4 individuals who stated that they cannot connect to Mitel while they are using VPN. 

Our assumption is because Mitel is a cloud base service and requires internet connection. Some of these folks who have VPN do not have internet connection which is why we are speculating the Mitel does not work.



Here are the 4 individuals that I'm aware of:



Enrico Budiman

Diego Franco

Le Tuan La

Thomas Yun



I'm sure there are more, but because you guys are swamped, we can come back to those who report the issue.



Tomorrow I will again follow-up with the team.



Thanks!



-- Will
