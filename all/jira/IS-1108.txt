comment: [~Bryanl] 
Can you ask the client if they can rename letter 319 to something like "PC Letter Credit Card" or something more unique? This file pattern name is too similar to their letter 307, "Permanent Credit" and needs to be more unique.

I have let the client know, thanks!


author: william.kong
comment: [~Natalie.Tom]: Please provide samples as discussed even though file naming convention is bad.



[~Bryanl]: SOW is not updated. We need to have the updated SOW. As for the file naming convention issue, please provide a status update on that as well.

comment: [~gthillaivel] [~Natalie.Tom]

Provided samples to client with note about alignment issue. Will provide SOW when client provides new naming convention for letter 319, thanks!


author: tuna
comment: Hi [~Bryanl],

Do you know when client can make decision to change the PDF data file naming convention and resend new test data file?*The LIVE date will be delayed, depends on client sending new data files with fixed naming convention,*



[~Natalie.Tom]is right, client needs to update file naming convention for either existing DL-307 or new DL-319. The program needs to verify letter types by the keywords in file name. The existing DL-307 is using keyword "PermanentCredit". So DL-319 file name cannot include "PermanentCredit" again.


 * Sample Data file name for existing "Permanent Credit (DL307)"
{color:#0747a6}PermanentCreditMErhar4970.pdf{color}
 * Sample Data file name for new notice "Permanent Credit Letter Credit Card (DL-319)"
{color:#0747a6}PermanentCreditLetterCreditCardAKirak3261.pdf{color}



Thanks,

Tun

Client is still pending approval from their team and no response yet either for file name convention change, will ask for an update Tuesday morning!


author: william.kong
comment: [~Bryanl]: Do you have any updates on this project?

Bear in mind, before we get approvals, we need new test files with the new naming conventions to re-test before we consider this project completed. Timeline for 6/6 is definitely not going to make it until we have this requirement.



SOW is still pending updates as well.



If there any further questions, please let us know.








author: bryanl
comment: [~William.Kong] [~Natalie.Tom]

Got off call with client and they have suggested the following two names as changing one doesn't provide enough clarity for the other:



DebitCardPermanentCredit for Letter 307
CreditCardPermanentCredit for Letter 319



Is is possible to change the keyword so these will work? They also said on their comment that 2/3 samples are approved and last one is on their end. Thanks.


author: william.kong
comment: [~Bryanl]: Discussed with [~Natalie.Tom]on the naming convention for the current letter 307 and the new letter 319. It looks to be ok and she will adjust the coding. However, we still like to get the test file with the 3 new letters to test the naming convention from client and the revise filenaming convention for letter 307.

Please advise on this.



Live date of 6/6 is no longer valid and we will need to revisit new timeline once we have the revised deliverables.


author: tuna
comment: Hey [~Bryanl], Per our discussion, I will update live date to 06/30 for now. Please let [~Natalie.Tom]knows when we got new test data files with correct naming convention.

Thanks,

Tun




author: william.kong
comment: [~dyuen]: Please advise if updated SOW was completed by [~Bryanl]with the updated file naming convention.

We are also pending from client a new test file with the right naming convention to make sure our processing program works as well.



Please advise.


author: dyuen
comment: [~William.Kong] [~Bryanl] [~Natalie.Tom], I updated the SOW. Can someone confirm what the notices are for letter codes 317 and 318, if applicable?

Thanks


author: JIRAUSER11103
comment: [~dyuen] 
The updated file name in the SOW for letter 307 should beDebitCardPermanentCredit. From above, letter 317 should beProvisional Credit Credit Card and letter 318 should be Merchant Issued Credit Credit Card.

In the description and attached test files on jira, letter 318 should beMerchant *Issued* Credit Credit Card, but from the test file originally provided by the client inTEST/FFFC_dn_RM_042022_1.zip.gpg, the file was namedMerchant *Issue* Credit Credit Card.

As seen in the screenshot:
!Letter 318 file from test 042022.PNG|thumbnail!

When the client sends a new test file with letter 318, that may clear up whether it is Issue or Issued


author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~Natalie.Tom], got it. I updated the SOW; [http://sharepoint-svr/AS/Shared%20Documents/SOW%20Directory/FFFC%20-%20Firefighters%20First%20Credit%20Union/SOW/FFFC_DailyNotice_PDF-Format_SOW.docx]

I also reached out to FFFC to confirm whether it will be Issued or Issue.

Thanks!


author: william.kong
comment: [~dyuen]: Thanks for the updates. Just a reminder, we do need new test files with the correct naming convention for final testing before we go live.


author: JIRAUSER11103
comment: [~dyuen] 
From the test file they sent "FFFC_DN_rm_061422_1.zip", there only seems to be 1 letter in it. They only sent letter 317 as seen in the screenshot provided.
!image-2022-06-17-14-58-13-129.png!

The pending test file should've contained the 4 letters:
317 ProvisionalCreditCreditCard
318MerchantIssuedCreditCreditCard
319CreditCardPermanentCredit
307DebitCardPermanentCredit


author: dyuen
comment: [~Natalie.Tom], thanks for checking the test file. I notified FFFC to resend with the 4 letters as well as gpg encryption.

Thanks


author: william.kong
comment: [~dyuen]: Any updates on the test file and also we still have not received final approval. June 30, live date will most likely be missed. PLease advise.

author: JIRAUSER11103
comment: [~dyuen] 
I wanted to let you know that in the recent and previously provided data file, the letter 318 continues to be provided by the client as "MerchantIssueCreditCreditCard" instead of "MerchantIssue*d*CreditCreditCard" soI updated the code for that and from my discussion with [~TunA], you may need to update the SOW as well.

!image-2022-06-28-08-38-52-814.png!


author: dyuen
comment: Hi[~Natalie.Tom], odd FFFC did confirm that the file would be coming in as "MerchantIssue*d*CreditCard". I will verify with FFFC again. And will update the SOW when confirmed/if needed.

[~TunA] [~Bryanl], FYI.


author: tuna
comment: Hi [~dyuen],,

In my opinion, "MerchantIssueCreditCreditCard" is better than "MerchantIssue*d*CreditCreditCard" for file names. I don't even know we can really use * in file name. Or, the client is just saying as wildcard (anything can happen in between).

You may want to confirm with client to use"MerchantIssueCreditCreditCard", instead of using to"MerchantIssue*d*CreditCreditCard".



Hi [~Natalie.Tom]: Please correct me if I am wrong.



Thanks,

Tun






author: JIRAUSER11103
comment: [~TunA]I think it's jira that's making the *'s appear because I bolded the letter 'd' and somehow it turned into stars now. But the file name they sent over has"MerchantIssueCreditCreditCard" instead of"MerchantIssuedCreditCreditCard".

To clarify, the client said the naming should have a 'd' at the end of the word Issue, but the test files don't have that


author: tuna
comment: HI [~dyuen],

We are still waiting client's confirmation for your below request. For now, I will postpone due date to 07/18. Please let [~Natalie.Tom]knows, when client confirmed. So Natalie can continue with QA/parallel/ release process.

Thanks,

Tun



"Upon reviewing with the programmer, it looks like letter 318 still came in as "MerchantIssueCreditCard" instead of the expected "MerchantIssue*d*CreditCard". We had to update the code on our end to look for the name without the 'd'. Please provide final confirmation if it will be "MerchantIssueCreditCard" or "MerchantIssue*d*CreditCard".

comment: [~Bryanl]please follow up with FFFC/[~Natalie.Tom]


author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~Natalie.Tom], I think [~Bryanl] is OOO. But FFFC updated and said the samples are approved!

"The final samples are approved! Please let me know the soonest that these can be put into production so I can relay this to our team. Thank you! Louie"



I also followed up about the MerchantIssue vs Merchant IssueD name and they confirmed it will be " MerchantIssuedCreditCreditCard"

From ticket #27804, comment 61:

I have confirmed that the letter should be called MerchantIssuedCreditCreditCard. I will get back with you on the final approval.
