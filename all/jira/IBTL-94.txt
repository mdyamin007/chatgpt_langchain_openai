comment: [~cesarg]: The dev database was down. Jun started it back up. Can you re-test and let me know if it works or not. Please re-assign the ticket after you get the results.

comment: [~cesarg]: Can you place the datafile in the /z/infoftp_int/wfcu/..../..../ folder to get scanned?  The staging database may have not ever scanned this file before. On a side note, I 'hope' the stage ftpscanner is working too. I 'think' it is but i'm trying to re-confirm with David once more.

Please re-try. I confirmed the ftpscanner on parallel is working from David. Please copy the data file to the infoftp_int so that it can be scanned and then rerun the job.

Also, please re-assign ticket to let me know whether or not it worked. Thanks!

comment: [~cesarg]: Sorry! RHS2 server is not ready for testing. Only RHS right now.
