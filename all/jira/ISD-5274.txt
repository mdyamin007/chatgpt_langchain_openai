title: 22121 - MSBK - Job status issue for specific user
description: Issue occurring only for one admin user, need to get on troubleshooting call.

Issue was with the Job Status link under Dashboard, not the Job Status tab. Apparently the Job Status link is still pointing to the old job status URL, hence the loading issue that the client was facing. Currently DSI is looking into updating this.

comment: Anil released fix to production, tested and confirmed it works. Job status link under Dashboard should now point to the new job status instead of the old.
