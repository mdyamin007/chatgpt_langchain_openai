From production samples I see that the corrupted character is em dash (long dash). It's advanced punctuation, and it would be a matter of honor for a software that specializes in publishing (I mean Papyrus of course) to support it, but alas, alas... 
I tried to paste it in Papyrus, but it does not work. Either their fonts don't have it, or they use some text encoding that doesn't.

One way to fix it is to replace it with a single dash'-' or two dashes ''. I'd choose the second, although the interruption in the middle might be visible.

[~phoebe.george] [~Juliana Vannik]it's not for me to make this decision, so please choose.
Or there may be a way to insert a long dash in Papyrus I am not aware of.

The character issue i guess solved by this ticket https://jira.infoimageinc.com/browse/IS-1804

I had merged the updated code and gave you print range for print sample. please check there , and it supposed to be fixed

I can see you replaced the dash, which could not be output, with a comma:
!corrected.png!

The client's text:
Page 1 of your Escrow Analysis indicates what has been collected{color:#de350b}{color}actual tax and insurance (T&J) payments, and what has been paid on your behalf{color:#de350b}{color}actual T&J distribution, for this calendar year.

Sorry, I do not think this is a good replacement.The meaning is not exactly the same. A comma means "AND" here, while the original dash meant "NAMELY".
 If you used a colon instead, that would preserve the original logic better, IMHO.

[~phoebe.george], what do you think?
 Actually, it also bothers me that we make the client aware of the fact that we can't print such a simple thing as a long dash...

comment: [~tanmay] This was an issue that was fixed by IS during production using the current file. The file that you're using is last year's, but the customer updated the bad character in the second location. IS did a programming fix for the bad character in the first location tied. Based on the merged code, can you use the current production data file that was processed on 11/14 to re-run the test?
