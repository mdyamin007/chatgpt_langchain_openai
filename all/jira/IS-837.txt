comment: [~thomasY] I added the test data file from the ticket, a sample of the Member Welcome Packet (w data mapping), and the updated Membership Agreement that we will need to use instead of the one that is on the sample.

comment: Per update from [~kericapote], the inserts may be inline or physical. Client is re-evalutate the specifications this. Keri will update the description if the insert requirements has changed.




author: kericapote
comment: [~thomasY] Per Amanda at the CU the second page is ok as an innline insert black and white. They are waiting to see how often these rates change. I have a call with them tomorrow and will keep you updated.


author: thomasy
comment: [~kericapote]Can they provide a bw version of the 2nd page insert?


author: thomasy
comment: [~kericapote]Do we have any updates?


author: kericapote
comment: [~thomasY] customer has decided to do it all black and white. They have a meeting today with their compliance team to see if they can remove the variable sheets (rate sheet, TIS) so that we can code as originally planned. I will provide update as soon as I hear back. Hopefully tomorrow or Wednesday at the latest. They will need to send us a new template in black and white as well.


author: william.kong
comment: [~kericapote]: Can you please provide a status update on this project; For now we are just waiting and timeline will need to be revisited.


author: william.kong
comment: [~kericapote]: Any updates? Since we have not heard back and timeline is no longer valid, i will put the status to be on-hold until client is ready to revisit a new timeline based on our next availability.

This project is holding for a while.

I will remove from developer resource list, if we don't have any action within one week from now.

Developer will not reinitiate project until we setup new timeline.

Please let me or Peter know if we need to restart the project.

Thanks,

Tun

comment: [~TunA] we are supposed to get a file this week. I have a call with them today. Please wait until I talk to them.


author: kericapote
comment: [~TunA] VWCU is going to try to send these in pdf format so all we have to do is print. I have requested the sample in vectorized format. We should have a new test file next week for review and evaluation.


author: kericapote
comment: [~TunA] VWCU sent a test file.

The file is in => /d/ftpbu/vwcubu/test

Please review and let me know if we can use this


author: tuna
comment: Hi [~thomasY]

Please review data file and brought up in daily scrum meeting. So that we can setup new timeline.

Thanks,

author: thomasy
comment: [~kericapote]The pdf file is just a template right? We're still pulling data from the xml like before?


author: kericapote
comment: [~thomasY] VWCU has decided to just send us finished pdfs with all the rates in there so we just print and mail. I told her I think we need a sample with data and exactly how you are going to be sending these files to us so we can evaluate. I mentioned that I need at least 5 accounts so I can see if it is 1 big pdf or infividual pdfs zipped and that we prefer the latter.


author: kericapote
comment: Thos may need to go back to the AM because the scope has changed.


author: thomasy
comment: [~kericapote]So we still need an actual data file then since the file they sent has blank data. But yes, this will need to be reassessed once we get the file.

comment: [~thomasY] [~TunA] VWCU sent a new test file. 

SamplePacket_05272022.zip

This file is located @ /d/ftpbu/vwcubu/test/ folder.


author: thomasy
comment: [~kericapote]I only see 3 pages per account. Are we still adding the inline inserts on our end?



Are they able to move the address page (page 3) to the front and rotate it so that it reads left to right?

author: kericapote
comment: [~thomasY] we are not adding any inserts. These pdfs should come ready to go (except OMR, IMB, address, etc.). Page count will vary per account. Did they come as one big pdf or individual pdfs? Can you tell the end of one and start of the next?


author: kericapote
comment: [~thomasY] I spoke w today VWCU and she is going to try to get us another sample file with the cover sheet in portrait and first in the pages next week when Doreen is back in the office, I am hoping we can use this for evaluation. These pdfs can be anywhere from 2-30 pages depending on if it is a new customer or not. VWCU Marketing team is putting together a real test file then Doreen needs to code to it so eta on that is about 4 weeks so hoping the week of 6/27. I will keep you posted.


author: kericapote
comment: [~thomasY]  new test file sent. Please review and let me know if it is ok.

test/VWCU-IndirectWelcomeDocs-20220722.7z

[~TunA] Please review and provide hours and time line. Scope has changed. Original pulled variable data from a csv file. These are just printing provided pdfs.

Thanks!




author: tuna
comment: Hi [~thomasY]: Currently this project is on HOLD. Please review data file first. If you can continue the project, please let me know. So that we can provide additional update description/hours/timeline to [~kericapote].

Thanks,

Tun


author: thomasy
comment: [~kericapote]The files are mostly ok except for a couple of pages.

Referring to one of the pdfs provided:[^PDF.IND.NEW.PACKET.292998.220722_075151.49488.pdf]



*Page 23-24* : too close to the left margin, we need at least 0.5 inches

*Page 25-26* : can they center it vertically or ensure there is a at least a 0.5 inch margin from the top, or can they make the pages portrait

The rest of the pages look ok

author: thomasy
comment: [~kericapote]These look ok at first glance. I'll have to see if the landscape pages will not cause issues.


author: kericapote
comment: [~thomasY] please provide an update.  We will need to get reevaluateed with new scope and new timeline.
Thanks!


author: thomasy
comment: [~TunA]The data file looks good enough to resume with this project. I'm thinking 8hrs for setting up new redtitan application.


author: tuna
comment: Hi [~thomasY],

I updated the status to "IN PROGRESS" and set below timeline. Please let me and [~kericapote]knows, if you have any concern for timeline.

Note: not sure 8 hours is additional hours (or) total hours. Since this is an IM project. I don't know IM care for hours.

Thanks,

comment: [~kericapote]Samples are attached.[^vwcuwl401.pdf]



Also 1 question for them:

Will the text on the top left always be at the top left of each new account? I'm currently using that as an anchor so I just want to confirm it will always be there.

author: kericapote
comment: [~thomasY] Is it the verbiage "submit@all" that you are asking if it will always be there?


author: thomasy
comment: [~kericapote]Yes


author: kericapote
comment: [~thomasY] samples are approved but the CU does not see the summit@all that you are referring to in their files.  Can we have a screen sharing so you can  show them where it is?


author: kericapote
comment: [~thomasY]per our call Friday please use the return address as an anchor as the CU doesn't know where the "Summit@all" is coming from. Please turn over to QA.


author: thomasy
comment: [~kericapote]Have all the necessary info on the SoW been updated yet? (file location, file name, etc.)

comment: [~thomasY] I'll check.  Can you provide dpvs for print samples?


author: kericapote
