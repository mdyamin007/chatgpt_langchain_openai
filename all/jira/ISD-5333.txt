title: EQBK - Merger with American State Bank & Trust (Pre-enrollment & Mapping
description: # Write account migration script to change account numbers (type shouldn't need to change, but do search by account type, too).
 # Leverage the Enrollment Process to run the pre-enrollment. The users need to agree to the Disclosure. Might need to temporarily disable the EnrollmentQueue logic (don't do it when a real Enrollment file is coming in).
 # Pre-ingestions need to be done AFTER account migration.

comment: Files have numeric account types. Phoebe has been informed to ask the client to send updated files.

comment: [~tai.trinh] [~Ethan.Yu] EQBK provided updated pre-enrollment file, attached here. Please check to confirm if good and/or matches CIF file values. If good, will request them to re-send the mapping file as well.

Please confirm if latest test file is good so EQBK can provide an updated mapping file as well.

Please also confirm when this will be loaded to the pilot site for review. Thank you!

comment: Hi Phoebe,



The latest Enrollment File was successful.

7804 records were good.

1132 records were bad.



The1132 records were either missing emails, or status fields (electronic or print).



If the client is okay with these numbers, they can provide the new account mapping file for me to process.



Otherwise, they'll need to provide a new pre-enrollment file with records with all fields filled out.



Thank you.

comment: [~Ethan.Yu] thank you! I believe the counts should be okay, but will forward to EQBK to confirm; the production file should not have the missing fields, and will ensure they are aware to correct before sending the final production file.

For the 'mapping file', it will actually be used for migrating history for EQBK legacy accounts. Please reference original description from the IMPL epic below. Originally, when Tai assessed, he mentioned that the account types had to be updated. Can you confirm? We wanted to ensure that the account types matched the CIF file - please check the original mapping file to confirm and let me know what needs to be updated (if at all). We need to run this file by EOD on Fri, 10/1 for their merger. Thanks!



Mapping file from old to new account number for document migration.
 - EQBK to provide legacy EQBK account #'s for migrating current history.

 - Provided file with the information and will need the history of the 'old' account number migrated to the 'new' account number.

comment: Ran a manual account number remapping for EQBK: 1 record was updated.



select *
from fin_account
where org_id =getorgid('eqbk')
and acct_number = '1300135061';

update fin_account set acct_number = '1301135061' where acct_id = '41246956';



Client wanted account number1300135061 to be remapped to1300135061.
