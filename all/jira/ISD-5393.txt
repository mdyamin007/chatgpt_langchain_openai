comment: Per the client: We need anywhere that references *Merchants Bank of Commerce*, changed to *Merchants Bank of Commerce, a division of Columbia Bank*.

I have also attached the PDF from Wilson for the eForm, new stock code is 3682.

comment: Go through InfoTRAC sites and perform the above changes.

At minimum, it should be the name defined inside the Client Configuration.

comment: Hi [~kdishroon],

I'll be taking over this for Tye since he is no longer with us. I finished uploading resource files sent by Jason, however RCBK does not have estatements nor a message manager tab, therefore I don't think we need to upload anything. The only potential name update on our side is the name displaying on InfoTRAC. I'm not sure if they requested this necessarily, but I've updated the name on InfoTRAC Pilot if you would like to take a look. Let me know if this change is still necessary, and I can revert/update the name accordingly.

comment: Hi [~Shun.Kuwashima] - Sorry for the delay, this looks good on pilot.
