comment: [~SamV2021] EQBK says Ac missing at the beginning, upper right of statement.

Do you know where that is or do you want me to ask him for a screenshot


author: JIRAUSER10906
comment: [~kericapote]

I need a screenshot or further clarification of where this "Ac" should be and what it should look like. Also, should this "Ac" be on each and every page?


author: kericapote
comment: [~SamV2021] The AC is the word ACCOUNT on the top of every page. I assigned ticket 23278 to you so you can see. Please provide another sample asap.

Thanks!

Attached new samples [^eqbkyl21254.2o1_small_new.pdf].


author: kericapote
comment: [~SamV2021] Approved! Ask Peter if he wants to do QA and release as there is a production file waiting. 

Thanks!


author: JIRAUSER10906
comment: [~kericapote] [~Igor.Khosid]

While I wait for word from Peter regarding whether we will be bypassing parallel, QA can go ahead with testing.

Note that I have made two additional changes to the file EQBKYL21.dfa. Updated project files have been exported to shared drive: /d/iss/qa/EQBK/EQBKYL21.zip

Thanks!


author: JIRAUSER10906
comment: [~kericapote] [~Igor.Khosid]

Per Peter, we will not be bypassing parallel as there were quite a few changes made to the code.

Please create the MPT ticket when possible. Thanks!


author: kericapote
comment: [~SamV2021] Per the customer on ticket 23278 we are going to bypass parallel as these need to be received 30 days before they are due per compliance. Please release code. I will have them approve production samples on the ticket.

Code has been released to production.
