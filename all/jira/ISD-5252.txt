comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid],

We updated the enotice letter 028 description from 'NEW VISA CHECK CARD' to 'New Mastercard Check Card'. Can you help us verify the update on InfoTRAC stage and SSO stage? 

InfoTRAC: Search account via Account Management tab and select the eNotice tab, you should see a notice dated 6/23.

SSO: Please select the 'Hypercubesso7' tab and enter in the acct number and email. Also, please use this in the FormURL section: https://epcustage.infoimageinc.com/
If you experience any issue with generating the sso key, you may need the host file entry. If so, I can provide that to you.

For reference of the notice description, please refer to the screenshots I attached to this ticket.
