comment: [~shahadet.hossain] , they will not have XML file processing for RWCU once we move to hypercube. Can you confirm if youve taken that into account during your testing? DP does always process XML first before the AFP. Can you take a look at why this is done this way?

comment: Hi Joe, We have started from the AFP process to test the client. Removal of XML file should not cause any issue. As we knew that there will be no XML file process anymore we have not analyzed the XML process. We will check the significance of running XML process before AFP and whether there is any relation in between those process and will let you know.
[~nafis.islam] please have a look into it

comment: These are some of the comments on rwcu.conf, should assist in your research

// setting begins
global.multipleStmtType=false

// The following setting for multipleDocType and blockEmail will allow XML processing to register email notification
// for monthly statement and AFP processing to register email notification for LOAN statement
global.multipleDocType=true
global.default.blockEmail=true
global.loan.blockEmail=false
global.mortgage.blockEmail=false
global.visa.blockEmail=false

comment: As far as I hava analyzed today, I didnt find any reason to process XML before AFP.  Those are independent of each other. XML process later on calls the afp registrars. So except the file, three are no difference.
