I have committed the code on trunk. I have to update the release note. I'll provide it by tomorrow.

Thanks.

There is some update on the code. I've committed the code on the trunk. I've added the release note on confluence and i've added a question there. Please have a look.

Thanks.

Hi [~moshiur.rahman],

OSCU has different admin users level/names. The changes to define.jspf are a bit out of scope. I'd rather just have a STMT_REASSIGN_PERMISSION_LEVEL = 3; and then check the profiel permission to be => the defined global variable. 

Also, OSCU has eNotice.  Please make the changes and deploy to Development so I can review.

Thanks,
Tai

The button naming convention is fine as is. We will see what the client says.

We have deployed oscu on pilot. We've gone through one round of testing. You can pass it over to QA now.

Thanks.
