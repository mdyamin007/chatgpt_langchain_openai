[^sucu_tax_account_missing.log] this is list of accounts from irs files those are not present in 2nd column ( Plan number ) xref file [^sucu_tax_xfer] client provided in ts.
 Would you please let client inform this and what to do in these scenerio

This is the file we usedSUCU_TAX_040122_0954_PROD.zip.pgp.

Thanks

comment: [~Juliana Vannik]-Any update


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~rony] [~gthillaivel] If the account is not present, can we provide an exception report like the one you provided to the client when file is processed? Client will then need to provide an updated XREF list to include the missing accounts.

comment: Hi [~phoebe.george]

[^sucu_acctnum_memnum_mis_match.log]

This is a report of account nos not found in xref file per form. The script will produce it every time it will be kicked off.

Please send it to customer to get updated xref file.

[~Juliana Vannik] [~gthillaivel]



Thanks

Any update?



Thanks


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~rony] The posted forms in general look good. 

They reported two issues - one is that we have duplicate forms posted. I've already informed ISD, and they are pulling down previously posted cycles for the same tax form so only the correct one is displaying.

Also, based on the mis-match log you provided, SUCU found that they left off a lot of accounts on the XREF file. They are preparing a new one to be sent and will be asking us to use the new one to re-post to confirm that the mis-match count is lowered.



For now, we will update the live date to 9/20 since the original date has passed, but we can finalize a date too once the pilot is approved.



[~Juliana Vannik] - please update the live dates on the stories and epic. Thanks!

comment: Hi [~gthillaivel]

For all the bugs open, I am waiting for a new xfer file from the client.



[~Juliana Vannik] [~phoebe.george]

Thanks


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~rony] [~gthillaivel] Talked with SUCU today - they found why there are accounts missing on their end with the xref file and working to produce a new set to include those accounts that were missing. If you want to note as QA on hold, or back to in progress (for IS), please let us know. SUCU did not yet provide an ETA for the new xref file, as it requires programming on their end to update before re-creating. As soon as I have an ETA, will update everyone.



[~Juliana Vannik] Can you copy the this above info to the open bug ticket as well for BT-158 and BT-159? Thanks!


author: gthillaivel
comment: [~Igor.Khosid]

Can you please update the ticket to IS "In progress"


author: igor.khosid
comment: Based on the previous comments status updated to "IN Progress"


author: JIRAUSER11300
comment: Hi [~rony]

Please note that here is the new XREF file for the accounts that did not post because they were missing from the XREF file.

Can you use this new one to re-process for the pilot site?

Thank you,
Juliana
