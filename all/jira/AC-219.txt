title: SFCE - [22603][pvt] KEYS-117 New Daily Notice
description: Current, I see only one SFCE daily notice application (DLA). The data file for that application is xml data files and come inside following zip file name (/d/infoftps4/switchthink/sfce/dn/sfce_mmddyy_dn_1.zip.pgp).



Here is a few items to confirm with client:
 - Can the client sent this new data file inside same zip file?

 - What is the data file naming convention this notice, when we go live?

 - Can we use all black and white (including logo)? Because the PDF template has color log.



Thanks,

Tun
