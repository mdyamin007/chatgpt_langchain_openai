comment: [~PramaG]- Changes...

1. Top right -call Universal Customer Service[s] at... Should be singular"Service".

2.Statements on pages 1, 12 and 17 appear to repeat account information.The statement message should be the final item on each page.

3. Do NOT count the backer as a page #.

4. Remove Footer -THANK YOU FOR BANKING WITH US. NOTICE: SEE REVERSE SIDE FOR IMPORTANT INFORMATION.

5. Remove Footer bottom right - (V) = Variable

6. Add MICR line (Let me get some info from the BA. More on this tomorrow).

Please let me know if you have any questions. Otherwise, please provide new samples.


author: JIRAUSER10909
comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]- all the updates are done except item 6 which is about adding the MICR line. Presently we have hardcoded it as we didn't get any info regarding this.

And for item 2, the data file that we have has the repeat account information. Could you please provide us any bigger data files?

Updated sample(*WESTMS2.pdf*) has been attached here. Please have a look.

[^WESTMS2.pdf]

Thanks


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~PramaG]- Can you please shift the MICR line so it's exactly 2 7/8 inches from the left side of the page. Please also update the MICR line to "5052:4021:" and put the account number after "4021".

Please also confirm the placement of the "Amount Paid" box on the top right. Please confirm it's 1/4 inch from the right edge of the page and 2 1/4 inches from the top.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~PramaG]- I also do not see the address on the back side at the top. Please note in the SOW...

Will include a #9 BRE. Must print return address on top coupon on the reverse side so customer can send using envelope. Address = Westamerica Bank, PO BOX 1260, SUISUN CITY CA 94585-1260


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~PramaG]- Please note, per William, we will need to enable AOLP via InfoTrac for the first cycle only so the bank can review an approve the first set of samples. Please let me know if you need anything. I'll let ISD know they need to turn on as well.

Updated sample(WESTMS21.pdf) has been attached here.

[^WESTMS21.pdf]

Thanks




author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: Hi [~PramaG]- Can you please move the MICR line down so it's 1/4 inch from the perf line? Positioning should still be 2 7/8 inches from the left edge. But the placement from the top does not matter. If you do this, can you move the Minimum payment and Late Payment Warning verbiage to under the Payment Coupon box?

Can you please also add an extra 2 spaces in between the routing number symbol ":" and account number. See attached - !Capture.PNG|thumbnail!

Please generate samples from this new test file -[^PCL BCL new sample (1).txt]




author: JIRAUSER10909
comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]- Updated sample(*WESTMS2_new_sample.pdf*) is attached here. Also attached is a snapshot(*current_placement.png*) showing the present positioning of the MICR line and Amount Paid box. Please see the attachmentsand let us know.

author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: That placement is perfect [~PramaG]- Let me send to the client. Once approved, I'll ask you to generate a DPVS so we can print hardcopies and send to the bank for testing. Thanks!


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~PramaG] - One last update. Can you align thestatement message with the bottom of the page so that it prints as a footer?

!Screenshot.PNG!


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~PramaG]- One more request. Can you please move Late Payment Warning and the Minimum Amount Due verbiage to the top over the Amount Paid box? See below. It was like this in the previous samples.

!Screenshot 1 (2).PNG!


author: JIRAUSER10909
comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]- Does the statement message always come in 3 lines? Currently, we are picking the last 3 lines of each statement as footer. Is it okay or not?

And what will be the footer placement? Should we print it on the bottom of each page? Presently we are printing it on the bottom of the last page of each statement.

Please confirm.

Thanks


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: Hi [~PramaG]- The message is variable I think. Can you just it always print at the bottom? Just print the way it comes in the data? As a footer on the first page?


author: JIRAUSER10909
comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]- To print the statement message as a footer, we need to know how can we capture this. Otherwise, it will not be possible with print image data. Please let us know.

Thanks


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~PramaG]- Understood and I will ask.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~PramaG]- Please disregard my request to move the statement message. Can you please just make the following update below...

Can you please move Late Payment Warning and the Minimum Amount Due verbiage to the top over the Amount Paid box? See below. It was like this in the previous samples.

!PCL Automatic Screenshot.PNG!


author: JIRAUSER10909
comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]- It is coming from the data file. In fact, in the data file, there are several such accounts that have "AUTOMATIC". Please see the attachment.

author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~PramaG]- These look great! Please provide a DPVS as we will need to print hardcopies and ship to the bank for testing of the MICR.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com

author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~anwarh]- There's only 10 pages in the 4.2o1 file. Why is the pages 673-680? WEST would like at least 20 statements for testing.


author: anwarh
comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com], then please print *629-682*. These pages also includes multi page statements.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~anwarh] [~PramaG]- FYI I just updated the SOW as OPS noticed an error when printing. Please note, the first page should be 4007 and not 4005. 4007 = perf at the top.

Also when printing it's showing "4000". Please see attached.

author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~anwarh]- Can we enlarge the coupon box? See attached.

!Coupon Box.PNG!


author: anwarh
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com], that will make the "Amount Paid" box to move down, which I think is fixed and can't be change? 


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~anwarh]- that is fine. The amount actually failed being picked up by the reader. But the MICR line tested fine.


author: anwarh
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com], Let me know if we need to change anything.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~anwarh]- Please enlarge entire coupon box. It's ok if the Amount Paid box moves down.

comment: [~PramaG]- Do you have any accounts that have transactions going to second page? The bank would like to see one and confirm the headers are present.

Also, can you please generate a sample with the "Return Service Requested" endorsement and OMR barcodes? Bank needs to see final product.

 # Recycle B1-Z Stmts (SOW updated. Must exclude from print and e. Include in PDF archival)
 # HOLD Stmts (SOW updated. Must exclude from print and e. Send to special file to print flat and mail directly to bank. Include in PDF archival)


author: anwarh
comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com], 

We cannot distinguish transaction lines from other types of lines, like subtransactions, normal paragraph lines, etc..
As this is print image data, without any identifier we are unable to put a header for transactions on subsequent pages. We are just printing those lines as is.

No, 2 & 3 will be reflected as we provide Infotrac samples. 

Thanks,
Anwar

We can do that but that will be a separate email from our processing script. 
The message you are showing I think is coming from the file scanner. 

Thanks,

author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~anwarh]- Yes, that is correct. The error message should go to Data Processing and place job on HOLD.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~anwarh]- Please also generate a sample of the special file with the HOLD statements for the bank to review.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com

3. I've updated the SOW with details regarding the Recycle B-1Z statements. There are variations of the "B-1Z" that will need to be accounted for.

Please regenerate the rt1 file and let me know if the issue is more widespread. Thanks!

comment: as mentioned [~anwarh] a few changes to the dfa
 # adjust bottom margins and squeeze some items a bit closer to make sure we maintain the clients page break.
 # When we break to the new page we should display from "CUSTOMER SERVICE" to the transaction header under the address block before we continue with the rest of the data from subsequent pages

The SOW's app type has not been updated. Additionally, since there are no checks or estatement, remove the cripple report name and esup section from the SOW. Please update the SOW and attach it here as well.

The address on the back side of the coupon doesn't match the address under the logo. Then do we need to print IMB under the address on the back side of the coupon as well?
