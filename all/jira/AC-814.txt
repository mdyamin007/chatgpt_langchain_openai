title: PLBK - [31170][pvt][in-house] Return Address Does Not Fit Return Envelope Window
description: I did more research on this and it's looking like a coding issue. This app has 3 letters that use a remittance, 2 of these letters have the vertical position for remittance address set at 1 inch and the other letter has it set a t 1.5 inch. I believe the letter in comment # 1 is a Loan Notice which is set at 1 inch. I believe they all need to be 1.5 inch. Below is the list of letters with remittance:



Letter 404 LOAN PAYMENT NOTICE - set at 1 inch

Letter 405 CONSUMER LINE OF CREDIT - set at 1.5 inch

Letter 407 MORTGAGE STATEMENT - set at 1 inch



Please open up a JIRA so we can do a fix for this.

PLEASE ADJUST REMITTANCE ADDRESS FROM 1 INCH TO 1.5 INCH FOR LETTERS 404 AND 407. PLEASE USE FILE "plbkdna_07012022_051852.zip" FOR TESTING. PLEASE MAKE SURE QA TESTS LETTERS 404, 405, AND 407 TO VERIFY THAT REMITTACE ADDRESS IS PERFECTLY SHOWN THROUGH CRE ENVELOPE WINDOW.
