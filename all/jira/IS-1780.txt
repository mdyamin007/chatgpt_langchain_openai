I wasn't able to find Wilson in the Jira menu  to assign the story to him, so I assigned it to you, please let me know if I need to reassign to someone else.

comment: Hi Wilson,

Please provideample, parallel ID, checklist, etc to QA. This is for report file. So I don't think we need sample approval from client. You already copied this month production report to client pickup yesterday. That will be the same for approval.

Thanks,

Tun

The changes I made:
 !flcu_changes.PNG|thumbnail! 

Before FLCU_BLANK_STMT_RPT_<MMDDYYYY>.txt was not moved to the client pickup folder (infoftps4/flcu/client_pickup).

Now it does:
 !flcu_pickup.PNG|thumbnail!
