Please see the below client feedback.



We found a few issues with the samples.
 * logos are missing (guessing maybe just because of being a sample)
 * On the payment coupon, the return address is missing
 * dollar amount for the balance forward doesnt line up with other dollar amounts (too far to the right)
 * Ending Balance text is shifted too far right and doesnt line up with other labels
 * we would like to suppress the transaction history, it is highlighted in yellow in the attached copy of the samples
 * we would like to do something to make the transition between each loan stand out more. The text for the "Loan:" and "Totals for Group:" lines already appear to be slightly larger text and possibly bold. Can we maybe underline or highlight those lines?

comment: [~Kbittmann] - Updated sample is attached. [^snfbml11.pdf] 
1) I've included the logo only for the combined loan statements. The first few use a different preprint.
2) Please verify if the return address on the payment coupon is correct. It's not in the data and I found it in one of the attachments on TS.
3) I've aligned the text and dollar amounts. This is a print image data file and the initial alignment came from the data. To make this update, I had to extract the values from specific positions in the data. Please let the client know that any changes to the data would cause issues. 
4) The transaction history is suppressed and the the texts "Loan:" and "Totals for Group" are underlined.

comment: [~Andrey.Kutsenko] - I didn't make an update to that template. That is the mortgage statement that is currently in production.
[~Kbittmann] - Please advise if we need to update this. It would affect the mortgage statements that are already live.
Thanks!
