comment: Hi [~Patric K],

We need an extra value from infoservice search/all API. For tax JSON objects we need that extra value. Like for example, the JSON object below is for tax, and that hold an extra value called "*is_correction*". The value will be displayed to the hypercube tax tab.
{code:java}
{
"presentmentType": null,
"pageCount": 1,
"orgName": "Whatcom Educational Credit Union",
"filename": "necu_12312018_10001879_7861.afp",
"acctNum": "2213994",
"docId": 3300831,
"stmtTypes": [
{
"docDesc": "5498",
"stmtType": "etax"
}
],
"is_correction": "tax",
"viewed": "Y",
"stmtDate": "2019-02-19",
"type": "tax",
"orgId": "wecu"
}{code}
*!image-2020-11-10-23-21-05-156.png|width=729,height=84!*

**Can you confirm if the API is ready or the response will be like this?

Thanks,
