QA first samples result: Pass and Samples ready for Customer review.

*Barnett*
Additional testing will be after client approval
Please, 
- Update due date if, as I can see from the previous comments, targeting go live by the EOM (November)
- provide the print samples after the sample is approved by the customer
-= provide updated SOW

*Thomas*
Please, provide the index file to validate updated content on InfoTrac and DPVS

comment: [~Igor.Khosid] Fyi, slcu enotice descriptions do not show up in general on the estatement member/admin sites, this is expected behavior in the code. So the only thing to verify for ISD is to confirm that the enotice posted.

comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid]/ [~berezinez],

Thanks, Barnett

comment: [~berezinez]/ [~Igor.Khosid],

Per Mike, "Print Samples are in the IS box"

Thanks, Barnett 


author: william.kong
comment: [~barnetts]: If the print quality looks ok by [~Igor.Khosid] , then we can release code late this afternoon. Per description of work, no parallel needed as long as print quality looks ok.



[~thomasY]/[~TunA]: Just a FYI. Once Igor agrees quality looks ok, code will need to be released today.

The story is still in testing.

*Barnett / Thomas - I'm wondering if the SOW - updated. Noticing some inconsistency with the envelopes?*

*In control file 4401*

*In SOW - 5280*

*However OPS just told me that this was recently updated to 5292*


author: barnetts
comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid],

SLCU has updated their envelopes. They will deplete the previous envelopes before switching over.
5292 SLCU #10 Permit- LC, PDF DL  (replaces 5280) =  20,000
5293 SLCU #10 Non-Permit- LC, PDF DL  (replaces 5281) = 2,500

Thanks, Barnett

comment: [~thomasY] [~barnetts]

This means for the letters 433 / 434 - we will be using 5292?

Please confirm?

Thomas - control file should be updated?

Barnett - I'm passing the story for now, however, please +open the new ticket to update the envelope code for IS (control files etc)

PS - the envelopes information appears to be correct in DP and PC documentation.

Also, check the print samples, paper stock missing on the preprint
