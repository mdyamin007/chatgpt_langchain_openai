Please advise on the vendors request for assistance:





 We are wondering if we can get your help connecting to the infoimage site. From our side we are hitting infoimage for the pilot site ([https://ctcupilot.infoimageinc.com/WESCOMSSO|https://us-east-2.protection.sophos.com/?d=infoimageinc.com&u=aHR0cHM6Ly9jdGN1cGlsb3QuaW5mb2ltYWdlaW5jLmNvbS9XRVNDT01TU08=&i=NWY0ZTk4ZmFlMGRkZDkwZTA4NjYwNGNj&t=TGZHcmJ3dWdzQ3J2NnlWdHRMSG1ybDJ4QzNkckxaV01LeGZ0UHNSUExyND0=&h=fa7abf9da63c4e448f374815c3005d65]) and it works fine, it turns us back a response that says its missing data, which is expected but indicates a successful connection. However, for production on our 2012 R2 servers when we try to hit production ([https://estatement.1stnorcalcu.org/WESCOMSSO|https://us-east-2.protection.sophos.com/?d=1stnorcalcu.org&u=aHR0cHM6Ly9lc3RhdGVtZW50LjFzdG5vcmNhbGN1Lm9yZy9XRVNDT01TU08=&i=NWY0ZTk4ZmFlMGRkZDkwZTA4NjYwNGNj&t=bGZMTU5Ia1o4MStqbFVoaVJHRElNVzE2SDY0RWRQVkFEYVN4YTRBenJNcz0=&h=fa7abf9da63c4e448f374815c3005d65]) it fails to connect and says there has been an error from those servers. When we try to hit the site from a 2016 server (The site is not hosted on this server so cant be utilized) and from my local machine it works in both places. We have tried telnetting to the pilot and estatement site, and successfully connect to both of them from the 2016, 2012 R2 and local desktops and the telnet works fine each time. We are wondering if there is any type of cypher you may be using, or any security sections that may be enabled that could be causing us to be unable to hit it in some scenarios, but allows us through fine in others. Any assistance your team can give us would be great! If a phone call would be more convenient to go through this with, we would be happy to set up a call to go through it also, just let me know back.

Hey Dawn,

Any update on this? It has a been a while. I've checked the Team Support, doesn't seem like the client have responded. Should this ticket be closed?
