comment: [~Bryanl] [~billr] Revert to paper process has been setup on pilot and the file was ran successfully. Please have the client review on pilot.

Client can review by going to InfoTRAC pilot Account Management, searching an account and clicking on the paperless history under the Delivery Preference section. It should show that the accounts were swapped from electronic to paper on 10/3 by user 'MsmSuperUser'. Note that production is not synced with pilot, so most of the accounts on pilot were already on paper. Therefore I provided a few accounts below that were switched over by the process:

1374920
1389005
1394901

*Note*: In the ticket it mentions 6,829 accounts however the file actually lists 7,669 accounts. Can you confirm this is expected? Thanks

Shun, client confirmed the volume of accounts:

Please note that the updated count of 7669 is correct

comment: Thanks for confirming the count [~billr]. Once client approves pilot, I'll move this over to stage for QA.

Shun, client approved the pilot.

"I reviewed the accounts and all look good. Please move forward with converting all accounts on the list from eStatement to Paper Statement."

comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid], this project is setting up the Revert to Paper process that consists of selecting a file with accounts and switching them to paper. We can just verify a few accounts to make sure the process works. To get started, here are a few that should be currently E on stage: 1346441, 1375443, 1383034

Instructions:
1. Verify that the above accounts are currently on electronic by going to InfoTRAC stage account management and searching those accounts.
2. On Stage PUI, run the file spcu_revertpaper.txt by selecting New Job and using the process called 'Revert account numbers back to paper'.
3. There are a total of 7669 accounts. Since this is stage, most accounts might be on paper and some may show up under Warning because they do not exist on stage, so that is fine. We just need to ensure it runs successfully. 
4. Go to InfoTRAC stage account management again and search for the same accounts as done previously. They should now be on paper instead of electronic. 

Let me know if you have any questions, thanks.
