title: EWBB - [34206][pvt][in-house] Duplicate statement June 2022
description: There are 980 other accounts that have a duplicate 9/30 statement (technically 981 since I hid the stmt from yesterday rather than removed just in case). I checked that the accts with the cripple flag in ms1_20220930_1_20221001_2210_ewbb.txt are the same as the ones with the replace flag in ms1_20221003_1_20221004_0536_ewbb.txt. There is one account 1043927 that we may need to handle manually, but I think the rest can be put in a list and ran on the PUI to pull them.
