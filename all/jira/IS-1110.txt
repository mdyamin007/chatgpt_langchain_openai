Please review the samples and submit for the client review

Client stated that the following changes need to be made, please update and provide new samples.
S-1728:
Left and right margins should be 1 inch.
Top of logo should be at the  inch top margin.

S-1737:
Left and right margins should be 1 inch.
Needs current InfoIMAGE SAFE logo.


author: thomasy
comment: [~jharvey]The logo we can handle but the left and right margins will need to be corrected on the pdf datafile from their end. We print the body as provided in the data.


author: thomasy
comment: [~jharvey]What do they mean by InfoIMAGE SAFE logo? I do not see any used by any of the other daily letter applications, and the current pdf notices print the logo and return address as provided in the data. If they want us to change the logo, I will need a BW logo image as well as the return address from them. Otherwise they will have to update the logo on the data.


author: william.kong
comment: [~jharvey]: Looks like there is another change. Live date of 6/22 may be missed. Please respond to [~thomasY]question above about the logo.


author: jharvey
comment: [~thomasY]

Client is saying that the logo attached is the most current one for Daily Notices and that the S-1737 samples did not show that logo.  What do we need to do to update? [^safe logo.docx]

Please see client's response.

The sample I sent for the S-1737 had the new logo on the header and sample doesn't match the same logo.


author: thomasy
comment: [~jharvey]Feedback from first set of samples:

S-1728:
Left and right margins should be 1 inch.
Top of logo should be at the  inch top margin.

*S-1737*:
Left and right margins should be 1 inch.
*Needs current InfoIMAGE SAFE logo.*



They said the logo was incorrect on the S-1737 and that the other 2 were correct. Now they're saying that's the correct one? Can they be clear on what they want?


author: barnetts
comment: Hi [~thomasY],

[~jharvey] followed up with SSCU and we are waiting for SSCU feedback.

Thanks, Barnett


author: barnetts
comment: Hi [~thomasY],

SSCU wants the attached logo (STANDARD LOGO FOR FORMS AND LETTERS - SAFE_BLACK_TIFF_1.25_12-19-2020) used for the notices.

Thanks, Barnett  [^STANDARD LOGO FOR FORMS AND LETTERS - SAFE_BLACK_TIFF_1.25_12-19-2020.tif] 


author: william.kong
comment: [~barnetts]: Timeline is past due and no longer valid. Once we update the logo, we need to revisit timeline.



[~thomasY]: Please work on that attached logo can see if it looks ok.

comment: [~barnetts]The attached logo is only the logo. It doesn't have the return address....


author: barnetts
comment: Hi [~thomasY],

Are you able to add the return address or do you need the logo to include the return address?

Thanks, Barnett 


author: thomasy
comment: [~barnetts]I can add it but I will need to know what font to use.

I just had a brief convo with [~TunA]. Because the due date is approaching, this is pdf data, not a new application but just an additional set of notices. QA - passed with comments.
However, next time, [~barnetts], please be sure to request actual data for the client.
