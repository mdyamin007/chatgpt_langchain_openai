title: DataTRAC Database Setup (Clone Request)
description: [~hesham.hanna] and [~kent.chan]: Per our discussion in our Brisbane meeting, Priority #1 is to clone DataTRAC DB (10.8.8.28) so that we can test in Brisbane:

Please open port 1433 and RDP

Here's a list of IP address:

10.4.20.31
 10.4.20.40
 10.4.20.34
 10.4.20.22
 10.4.20.23
 10.4.20.25
 10.4.20.71
 10.4.20.127
 10.5.20.39
 10.5.20.70
 10.5.20.72

Please update Brisbane when you are done.  Do {color:#de350b}*NOT*{color} update the DNS server. We need to leave msgps along to 10.8.8.28 in our current DNS servers. If you change it, it will impact Menlo Park. If you have questions, please don't hesitate to let me know.
