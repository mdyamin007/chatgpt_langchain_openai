CU is trying to understandwhy the Doc Code and Member Numbers were not included in the index files for these 53 accounts that are attached.

we didn't change anything about archival besides splitting only. We looked into the existing code and found that for bankruptcy accounts, it is not using member number and doc code for index.so for those accounts where member number and code are missing are actually bankruptcy accounts, here is a pdf snapshot of such account 524030900 where those 2 no is missing and it is a bankruptcy account.

comment: [~misbah.uddin@dsinnovators.com] [~rony]-My apologies if I am missing something, but if I understand correctly, we are mailing out these bankruptcy statements, so we would want to maintain an archival copy like the non-bankruptcy statements. Is this a feature the CU requested or is this a bug in the archival code that can be corrected to include the Doc Code and Member Number in index file for all statement scenarios?

The original request was only splitting the zip file at a lower size 300MB. We did change only that part. We didn't change anything about any other archival specs.



Archival copy is being generated for those, it's just the index file is not containingDoc Code and Member Numbers in the index file due to those are bankruptcy accounts.

That's what we understood by researching the existing code.

comment: [~rony] [~misbah.uddin@dsinnovators.com]- Why aren't we using DOC code and Member number in the index for Bankruptcy accounts? Is it because it's missing from the data? Please advise. I don't see anything in the SOW. Let me know and I'll update.

Like I said we didn't change anything, anything besides just to reduce the size. I am talking to the original developer to find out why.



Thanks

The bankruptcy issue is solved. Now for bankruptcy accounts, the DOC code and Member Number are in the index file.
