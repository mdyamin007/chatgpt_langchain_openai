description: * Synchronize "some" of the files for now until we have servers in Brisbane to synchronize all 1.5TB of data.

comment: Per meeting clarification last week and the updated Brisbane server list. We will NOT be using the "cloned" version of the ISWK servers. All of the physical ISWK Menlo servers will be physically to Brisbane.



So this task is CANCELLED
