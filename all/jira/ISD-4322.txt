Hi all,

We just tried "1234" - SSO still not working

comment: Hi [~nprimak],

did you change it to stage and changed the password? also you should try with "disso -hypercube" one.

I have added a screenshot to row 1 on smartsheet, there is not binding with the account number you guys can test with any account number.

Create New User and Create New account in Account Management tab is not creating User/Account.

'Confirm' Button is grey out or does not do anything

To finish testing I also need some accounts with statements, nothing processed on staging,

Also Reports are empty, no data. May it is not very important because of big rush, but please confirm on it.

1394985

1372212

Very strange, I can verify provided accounts on SSO site, but on InfoTrac I don't see these accounts.

Shun, can you please check?
