ca-preproc-pr-03.infoimageinc.com

*Description:*

This is a+fresh install+ of this system that will replace the preprocessing03 server. This is using the+more+ current version of AFP2WEB vs the Menlo Preprocessing03 system.

*Objectives:*

Regression testing of the AFP2WEB software:
 * Use the ca-isis-pr-01,ca-isis-pr-02,ca-isis-pr-03 (i.e. the Brisbane papyrus processing systems) to create the PDF archivals.

 * Ensure no processing issues or missing resources or zipping issues.
 * Make sure when testing the afp2pdf python scripts that you test all modes: direct, index_build, index_parse, index_dvd, index_build_multicore, etc etc..
 * Make sure file size are equal or less.
 * Benchmark processing performance [This task needs to be done after April 1, 2020 when we are using the Brisbane Equipment] The above steps can still be done BEFORE the April 1, 2020 date; On April 1, Network department will+transfer+ this system to Brisbane's new datacenter.
 * Verify InfoTRAC Job Status - ExtendedTrack PDF converts ok:
 ** Check if 2D Barcode shows next to mailing address and the bottom left corner to show

comment: [~shailendrar]: System is fully up and running. Would like you to help run a couple of PDF archival processing "manually" to confirm functional testing.
