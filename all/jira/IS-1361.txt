THEN suppress TRANSACTION from statement

Note from CU: In general, we want Tran Code 745 from both Record S and Record W to print to the statement. 

While we do have multiple scenarios where we are suppressing the transaction from the statement, we are looking to suppress Tran Code 745 from printing to the statement if it's in Record S and the DISB-PROC-DATE (S,1006-1011) is either 05/02/22, 07/01/22 or 07/02/22. The other two scenarios in which want to suppress Tran 745 from the statement apply to both Record S and Record W (when REC-CORP-ADV-REASON-CODE (S/W,0194-0197) is NULL; when NET-DISB (S/W, 0016-0021) and TOTAL-RECD (S/W, 038-0043) are both zero).

comment: [~tanmay]- Issue with samples. Please see below and advise.

It appears that neither issue has been corrected.

Tran 175 fix - please see ANTHONY LOMBARDO statement. The issue is still not resolved. The Principal Only Payment transaction amount is blank.

Anthony Lombardo - 0008621910 - 1705916063

Tran 745 fix - please see PAUL J KOSNICK statement. The issue is still showing on the statement. Corporate Advances from 7/1 still exist.

Paul Kosnick - 0002661910 - 1705915809

Can you have programmers review the fix before we continue our review?

I also attached screenshots of each statement with the problem highlighted.
