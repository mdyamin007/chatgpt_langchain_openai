Customer responded to samples:

"There are not loans in this sample that I can find. There are only checking and money markets. This ticket is simply to change a column on the loans portion of the statements. The sample provided does not really show any loans.

How soon can we get another sample?"

comment: Jun,

Customer says there are not any business loans to review in the sample. Customer asked if they could submit a list of accounts to be pulled for review. I have asked for the list to be uploaded on the ticket.

Customer provided the attached file of account numbers they want samples of for review: Sample_list.txt

comment: Jun,

Customer responded to the samples:

"WE still see in the samples where the business loans aka commercial loans still have the old verbiage for the column heading as Late Charge. See pages 8 and 9. So to be clear, the heading for the consumer loans (CNS), mortgage loans (MTG), and commercial loans (CML) should have the same verbiage. It should not read 'Late Charge'. It should read 'Fee/Charge'.

If you have any questions, please let me know."
