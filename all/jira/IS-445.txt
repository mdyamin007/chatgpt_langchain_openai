comment: Hi Tohid, we already used the previous dpvs to send the client samples. What is this dpvs for?


author: tohiduli
comment: Hi [~andreav]

Diego asked me to provide dpvs that would be generated with full data file.

Previous dpvs was generated by process that ran with a smaller data file, since the process takes a long time to run with the main data file.

comment: Hi [~diegof]

E-statement posted to pilot site with 1031 data file.


author: andreav
comment: Hi Tohid, as discussed today, please complete the following by tomorrow morn, 1/12:
* Run new samples using the attached account list from client (*TestMessageFile*). Use 10/31 data and MM campaign ID Number: *{color:red}39770{color}* plus the manual messages by list.
* Post on Job Status on InfoTRAC. and give Ethan a new index file for posting so everything is consistent.
* Provide a dpvs so I can send client physical samples. (only need to print samples from the account list so please provide the file id and print range)
* Just added on feedback smartsheet - On MM preview, replace statement template with most updated one.
* Provide full cycle archival sample using 10/31 data.

Let me know if you have any questions.

[~andreav]/[~Igor.Khosid]: Please keep me and [~diegof]posted if there is any pending items. I'm real concerned that we have not started parallel yet. Please ensure OPS is ready to react to get Parallel initiated ASAP. From my previous benchmarking, it takes *13 plus* hours from start to finish on all 3 services Print, eStmt and PDF Archival.
