comment: Hi [~andreav],

Ran the process using data cycle103121.

I copied the sample at /z/infoftps4/ufcu/client_pickup/ufcums12314.2o5.pdf

The file size is too big to upload in jira.

Please review.

Thanks

Hi [~mahbubS]we just received the story in QA one hour ago. What the parallel you already asking for?

QA still need time to review it.

BTW - please attach IS checklist to the story

I'll let you know when the testing will be completed

comment: Once parallel is passed, I will advise when to release code. This should be released together with IS-549.


author: mahbubs
comment: Hi [~andreav],

Let me know when parallel is passed.

Thanks


author: william.kong
comment: [~mahbubS] : *Please submit code transfer form for now*. [~andreav]is pending when the other UFCU parallel is going to be completed so I don't know what "Due Date" to update on this ticket. I think client wants all changes for all UFCU related projects to be released together.



For now, I will mark Monday, Dec 6, 2022. Do NOT release code on that day unless [~andreav]+explicitly+ asked you to.


author: andreav
comment: Parallel has passed. I am checking if a code release date of 12/7 will work for the client. I will update the ticket 23662 and this story once confirmed. In the meantime, please provide the information needed for IS managers to roll out the code when needed.

comment: Hi [~andreav] [~Peter.Dang],

Code release related info is given in Jira IS-549.

IS-549 andIS-592 should go to live together.

Thanks


author: mahbubs
comment: Hi All,

Code has been released by Tun.

Thanks
