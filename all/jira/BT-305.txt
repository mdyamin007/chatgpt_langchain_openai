what is the anchor for letter 004?

The current program uses "Page #" as anchor but in the data file not all account has "Page #".

example data file attached

[^NOTICES0000.DAT]

The data file for 004 was the wrong one. I exported the project with a valid data file in the QA directory(EQBKDL004.zip)

attached pdf sample:[^eqbkdl004.pdf]
