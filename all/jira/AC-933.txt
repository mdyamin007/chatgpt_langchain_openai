Need to know where to put the Insert. And client supposed to provide account list. Need to know how they will provide this, is it fixed account list of recurring with the cycle.

Also need to know if this insert is for some specific months.

This is for s,f,e option.

Need to ask dt job id, provide isd index, dpvs, archival.



------------------------per Kris-----------------------------------

1. You will send a fixed account list somewhere in the middle of month as per comment 1. Which means you will not send a separate file for account list with each cycle. Let me know if this is correct.



2. When you said quarterly insert, does it mean this insert is applicable for some specific months and will it be recurring for all years? Please confirm.



3. Also, we need to know where you want to see the insert. Before check images starts or after?



-------------------------per Client--------------------------------

1. Yes, we will send one account list to be used for each cycle received from 10/1 to 10/31 to be checked against.

2. Yes, we run this same insert with a new account list at the end of each quarter. We always catch the quarter end statements and then continue for a month to catch all necessary accounts. I know we had discussed before if there was a way to make this recurring so we wouldn't need the whole process each time, but the programmers had suggested that wasn't possible. If that has changed, that would be wonderful.

3. We would like this to be before the check images.
