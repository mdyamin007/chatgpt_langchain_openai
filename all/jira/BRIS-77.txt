Prem,

Can you help create 2 folder/partition on Isilon.

dev_pvnas - (12 TB) We will use this for as Dev PV-NAS. Please help mount to 'ca-input-dv-01' when ready.

logs - (15 TB) We will use this to back up all the log files for each of the services. Please open access to ca-util-pr-01 and 02.

Thanks

David
