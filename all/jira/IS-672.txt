title: GDCU - [24829][pvt][in-house]TAX 2021 Update
description: The mapping in GDCUMS11.dfa for taxes need to be updated.



IRS changed data record layout this year (Add additional amount fields and shifted recipient address and other information after those extra account fields). I think GDCU tax is still formatted in monthly statement format program (as combined setup). If so, we will need to update field positions according to IRS record layout.

Hours for development: 3 IS hours + ISD hours required

Turnover Date : 12/15/2021

Sample to QA Date: 12/22/2021

Sample Approval Date: 12/28/2021

Go live date : 12/30/2021

comment: Hi [~dawnl], [~Jessica], : Do we have 2021 test IRS data files. So that, [~jun]can generate sample for each form.

Hi [~jun]:Can you please update field positions in stmt DFA. As usual, please release to parallel and production for sample process. But we will need QA when we got test data files.

Thanks,

Tun

comment: [~dawnl]: I spoke with [~TunA]; Can you still try to get client to send test file earlier before end of this week versus waiting next Monday and have our internal team rushing.

There is a big risk on this custom application that our team needs ample time to address any processing issues. The later client sends file, the less time we have to address and processing issues. Please consult with [~Jessica]to see if we can get AMs to assist to expedite.

comment: I have reached out to client for sending the test file this week.


author: dawnl
comment: Client's response 12/15/2021:

"Because of some unforeseeen issues we are installing our final Symitar release, which contains the tax document information, early morning at 2am on Tuesday December 21st . Once that is installed I can run a test file and get that over to you."


author: dawnl
comment: Client sent test file on 12/20 and12/21.  Both are failed.  They sent last year file today.  It was processed successfully.  They have also opened a case with Symitar (the data file vendor) to help the issue of this year's file not running correctly.  They hope to have a correct file for this year first thing tomorrow morning.

comment: [~dawnl]: Any updates on GDCU / Symitar? Can client please escalate to Symitar on getting us a test file. As stated above, we are at risk for not being able to test their tax forms before year end. Is client ok delaying the mailing of their year-end statements until we thoroughly test the tax forms. Please reach out to [~Jessica]to discuss this as well.

comment: Hi Will,

Client has sent the tax test files. DP will need to process them with latest eom data file. Per Jessica, IS will need to provide print file and range for print sample for client review. See TS #24993

comment: [~Igor.Khosid] Description of changes
 * Update IRS data mapping in statement format program for following tax forms

1099INT;

1099Q;

1099R;

1099SA;

1098;

1099M;

GDCU uses standard IRS format to household with statements. This update is for tax forms only to 2021 format. Household logic for end of year statements is already in place. 



You can use standard samples attached in [https://app.smartsheet.com/sheets/mPwjQ6CPX4h5VQqpR78rH6pR5MX7vCQCRJmCv2c1?view=grid] for comparison purposes.

comment: Hi Jun - please provide print file and rang for print sample. Thanks.


author: jun
comment: Hi [~dawnl], I've copied zip file with split PDF to client pickup,GDCUMS_Samples_1230.zip. Do you still need print range? I believe parallel already started.


author: dawnl
comment: Hi Jun, client said that there were no tax samples merged with the statement file GDCUMS_Samples_1230.zip. can you double check?


author: dawnl
comment: Hi Jun,

I have discussed with Jessica, GDCU has approved tax samples in TS #24993 comment #38 and GDCU #24829] is in-house change so client doesnt need to approve that. Please ignore my comment.

This update has to be released today.

Thanks.

comment: [~jun]is gone for the day. It's passed the half day mark. I will need to text him to see if he and [~yameelee]can help later in the day to release code. If [~yameelee]is tied up, I will try to get another senior engineer to assist.
