description: Customer Reply:Yes ignore the minus in just principal tag. total I have for this s/b $25,030.82

Phoebe: You are correct, the value of the "Total" field comes from the summation of <principal>, <interest> and <lateFee> tags. Can you confirm what the total should display as for this particular example on your end. We mainly want to confirm if we need to ignore the minus sign for the principal tag or the minus sign altogether.
