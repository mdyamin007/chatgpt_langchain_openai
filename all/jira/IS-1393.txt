comment: [~William.Kong]No. Samples have not gone to the client as I am still waiting for samples on IS-1395. Please see EPIC Ticket (AC-809) as this is only one portion of this update.

Furthermore we cannot go live until we have the new inventory of envelopes arrives which are not expected to get here until the end of September.

This was also stated in the email I responded that [~Jessica]stated.
