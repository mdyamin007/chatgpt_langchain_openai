For this particular domain, the proxy servers used are *ca-proxy-pr-17* and *ca-proxy-pr-18* where we have to install the certificates.
 However, we were unable login to the proxy server *18.*
 Please advise how we should proceed.
 Kindly take a look into it at your earliest convenience as there could be other issues related to the server possibly being down.

Thanks.
Salman.

The certificate has been updated for server:*ca-proxy-pr-17*and*ca-proxy-pr-18*

We have tested the proxies and it works fine.



*FYI:*we were able to login to the proxy server *ca-proxy-pr-18**.*



Thanks.
