title: GCBK [20179] [pvt] - Check Images/Add Users
description: 

*Description*:

Per Peter:



Reprocess for the following:

Print - Need to print the attached insert and mail out corrected statements

eStatements - Repost with correct check images; do NOT send out email notifications

Archival - Correct archival for GCBK to ingest.



Estimate 15 hours.



Extract all cripple accounts from cycle 4/22-5/3 cripple report (see ts#19735 or attached Cripple Report from ticket from comment #19)

Create an invert account for each cycle for reprocess

Set insert file to pull insert 1



We can start on 6/22 and have the invert list ready for DP by 6/24. My estimate for DP to process all these cycle will be done before 7/1, however, please check with Neil to be sure.



+*Note*+: We need a new timeline for when these can be completed since I missed the TO date.
