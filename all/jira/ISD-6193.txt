title: MOCU - [24790][pvt] Statement Delivery Management
description: Our eStatements site used to have a link such that the member could manager their statement delivery where they could opt in or opt out of eStatements.  That link no longer exists.  But a "Newsletter" link exists which needs to be removed. 

Remove link for "Newsletter" in the left panel


TO: 1/13

comment: Hi [~jharvey], I've removed the Newsletter tab on pilot. Since mocu appears to be one of our older clients, I'm not sure if they have SSO access on pilot, therefore I attached a screenshot of the change for them to review.

comment: [~jharvey] have you heard back from the client about pilot approval? The due date is already passed, so we'll have to adjust that once we hear back.

Client approved the screenshot today. Please provide new timeline. Sorry for the delay!

comment: Thanks [~jharvey], we usually do our production releases on wednesdays, therefore I'm looking to aim for live date of 2/9. Let me know if this is fine and if so please update the due date accordingly.

Hi [~Igor.Khosid], I've removed a Newsletter link on stage SSO, see the mocu_pilot_newsletter_removed.PNG for reference. It used to exist on the left side panel under the link 'How do eStmts work', but it should no longer be there now. Can you have someone test and verify?

On the SSO test page, please use the 'cubus sso' tab instead of the 'sso-old7'. You should be able to use the prefilled information to login. Let me know if there's any issues.

Thanks,
Shun

comment: [~jharvey] Sorry I forgot I'm actually taking 2/9 off, is it ok if I release this to production a bit sooner near EOD on 2/8?

Yes 2/8 works for release
