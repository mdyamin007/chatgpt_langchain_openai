title: Backup Partition (Isilon)
description: Kent/Prem,

Can you help create a "backup" partition on Isilon for us to store all the backup file such as oracle, mongo, swift, SVN, Git, etc.

We estimate about 20 TB. Please also open NFS access to the following VM.

ca-utils-pr-01

ca-mogoreg-pr-01

ca-mongojob-pr-01

ca-elasticsearch-pr-01

ca-swift-pr-01

ca-oracle-pr-01

Jira VM (Pending move)

Postgres VM (Pending move)

ca-pui-pr-01

Thanks
David
