Please update the backers. See client's response below.

"

There are multiple areas on the back of each that say Federal Credit Union. Each instance needs to be changed.

It should read "Solano First - A Division of Valley Strong CU"

comment: I just spoke with Jessica. Since we are pending approvals for the logo update project, we want to get a head start on releasing the logo changes prior to their final approvals so that we do not have to rush tomorrow.



[~jira_naru] : Please release the CFCU HELOC Statement Logo updates and {color:#FF0000}+*hold*+{color} on the Visa since it cycle mid-month. {color:#FF0000}Please do not close this ticket we release Visa after we get their approval.{color}



*PC/DP*: Per talking with Jessica, we need to go through approval process for Monthly and HELOC. So after processing, please hold the job for client to review and approve.



[~dawnl] and [~Jessica] : FYI. We will hold off on the Visa portion.


author: william.kong
comment: [~dawnl]: Now that EOM is over, can you advise if client approved the Visa sample. There next cycle is 7/15. I'm going to extend the due date to 7/14 since the second part of this project has not been approved. Please advise.


author: dawnl
comment: Will - I have followed up with client on the approval of Visa sample in TS #20605. Thanks.


author: dawnl
comment: Nar - client has approved the sample for visa. I have assigned the TS parallel ticket #21223 to you.

I believe you 20605 but not 20506?
Yes, I know pdf samples are there. I'm asking for actual print samples.
QA testing - completed after the actual samples will be validated.
