title: 25525 - BANB - Posting auth file onto pilot
description: Production validation:
-Set the threshold to small value so that auth file fails. This way we can see threshold of what to be removed.
-Use the auth file query to find the total count of ufas in our db (minus business/subusers).
-Find the difference between the count in the auth file and in our db, the percent value of that should be around the value that we see in the failed auth file logs.
-If that's good and client is ok to proceed, we will prob have to reset the threshold by setting it to a high value, then rerun the auth file.
-Set the threshold values to the expected values, then commit it to conf file.

Worst case, we have a script to rollback changes.
