Please see request from client below.

Would it be possible to add in a 2D barcode into the top right corner of the first page that just has the member number?

This would be exactly like we do with the Member Statements.

This would be helpful for our staff when dealing with possible returned mail.

Would it be possible to add the tiff images here, if not that's fine we can take it from comment 22 ts 31260. But we need to directions of how to display those tiff files, meaning the serial and simplex/duplex style. Would it be possible to provide it?



Also would you please provide sow link?

[~Tasneem]

Thanks

Please see attached tifs and SOW.  I also included the information on how the client would like the simplex/duplex set up below.

These letters will have to be sent as their own segments for us to process with the correct BRE.  1 Segment for Foreign and 1 Segment for Domestic.  Are we able to program to Segments 3 & 4?

Also, please see client's request below.
I know we're getting a little late in the game, but would it be possible to add in a 2D barcode into the top right corner of the first page that just has the member number?
This would be exactly like we do with the Member Statements.
This would be helpful for our staff when dealing with possible returned mail. [^APCU_DailyNotices_PRINT_SOW_Symitar.docx]

Are those actually the same letter or different? Meaning does a domestic letter have a different info code or the same?
 * AP_ FTIN_DOMESTIC_NOTICE = apcu_DN_mmddyy_3.zip.pgp
 * AP_ FTIN_INTERNATIONAL_NOTICE = apcu_DN_mmddyy_4.zip.pgp



And those lettersapcu_DN_mmddyy_3.zip.pgpapcu_DN_mmddyy_4.zip.pgp can come the same day with other letters right we need to process those separately with segments 3 and 4 . Right?



[~Tasneem]



Thanks

Rony,

These have the same infocode, they have to be different segments due to the BRE we are including for this request. These can come in the same day as their regular daily notice file, just as their own segments.  

The client provided separate test files based on needing to separate the domestic and foreign addresses as we requested.  I have attached them below. They also requested if we could release code on 09/05 because they would like to send live files on 09/06.

These 2 zip files will contain one file inside these, right?



[~Tasneem]

Thanks


author: jharvey
comment: [~rony]  [~Tasneem]

Rony,

Each zipped segment will contain one data file. Seg 3 will be domestic and Seg 4 will be international. 


author: rony
comment: Hi [~jharvey]

So segments 3 and 4 will contain BRE? Just wondering I am not seeing anything like a coupon in the statement. For which page we will needthe BRE?



And from which bin the bre will be pulled? It's bin1 right, per sow 33223.



[~Tasneem]

Thanks






author: jharvey
comment: [~rony]  [~Tasneem]

Rony,

Yes Segments 3 and 4 will each contain a BRE, I have included the stock codes below.  There is not a coupon, the member should return the W9 form and the W8BEN form in the BRE.   These can pull from bin 1, I will update the SOW to show all 3 stock codes.

Segment 3 Domestic BRE Stock Code 5328 (6x9 envelope)
Segment 4 International BRE Stock Code 5327 (6x9 envelope)

We will provide a sample in a bit. But want to confirm one thing, the data file name inside the zip file has a space.

will it be like that in production?

See client's response below:

Apologies, no.  That was an accident, I manually named the the test files. Here are is what they should be.

AP_FTIN_DOMESTIC_NOTICE#

AP_FTIN_INTERNATIONAL_NOTICE#

Thanks for checking about that!

Previously provided sample was for enotice, but the client requested for the 2d barcode in the top right corner of the first page of the paper. Hence, added the pdf for the paper sample as well in the folder.

Tiff in the backer in the sample does not match with the tiffs in the ticket.

Is there a way to eliminate the blank page?


author: JIRAUSER11501
comment: Hi [~jharvey]



W8 was supposed to be in simplex format while W9 inserts were supposed to be in duplex format. Therefore, the blank page here indicates the back page of W8 insert.



Thanks

Per Rony on scrum, we are not able to eliminate the blank page, it is the one page of the job that the client requested to be simplex instead of duplex.

comment: Master Parallel Ticket 32781 assigned to [~rony]


author: rony
comment: Hi [~jharvey]

Should we include processing these 2 data files by cron or Dp can manually kick off the processing script to run for segment 3 and segment 4.

Currently for segment 1 cron is set since it comes daily. Are those will come daily too. If not Dp can manually kick off the process for segment 3 and after that 4.

But if come daily then better to include this as cron. And if set as cron and let's segment 1, 3, 4 all data presents at the same time, then our script will pull all the data files and process segment 1,2 and 3 seperately.



Let me know.

[~Tasneem]

Thanks




author: jharvey
comment: [~rony]  [~Tasneem]

This will be an annual mailing, so I think it would be best to manually process instead of setting it up to run on the cron.  Do you agree?


author: JIRAUSER11501
comment: [~jharvey]

Yes agreed. Currently the cron runs with segment 1. We will update the script so that Dp can manually run with segment 3 or 4 and script will pick the appropriate file with segment 3 and 4.



Thanks
