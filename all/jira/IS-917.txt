The first round sample result: Pass and Samples ready for Customer review

comment: Updated TS27139 with sample. Pending client approval by tomorrow, 3/9 noon.

comment: [~andreav]: Fixing due date to 3/14.


author: andreav
comment: William, the next cycle is coming on 3/13. We need to have this code rolled out by 3/11 so that Sunday's processing capture's the update. See client's email from yesterday:
_The more immediate topic to discuss is mortgage statement processing this Sunday 3/13/22, which we can try to do via email.  Our expectation is file processing should go as smooth as it did last cycle and proofs will be ready for us at 7:00 am PT, when we intend to start proofing.  Once approved, mortgage statements should upload to eStatements and eNotifications to go out same day, on Sunday 3/13/22.  Print and mailing will be the following Monday 3/14/22.  Please confirm this can be accomplished._

The 2nd round sample result: Pass and Samples ready for Customer review


author: andreav
comment: William, Nar - See client feedback and advise:

UPDATE:   We noticed that not all of the samples provided had our statement message on it.  Can you please confirm that in production all statements will include the statement message?  I reviewed a handful of production statements from February and all of them did include the message.  Wasn't sure if the issue presented because we were in a test environment.

Hello, our business units have reviewed the proofs and the MS41 code change looks good.   However they are requesting two additional changes.

Anytime the statement file indicates a commercial loan in the code(same code you are using for MS41), then the following fields should be update:

The department name on the coupon should be Business Lending
The extension in the phone number at the bottom of the payment coupon should be 2052.
Please confirm if the MS41 change will be effective for this Sunday's processing on 3/13.  Also, when could we expect the other two new requests above to be done?
