title: The address does not fit in envelope window for detachable coupon (wecuml11)

I suppose the loan statement uses envelope 4403 for the coupon?

I suggest moving the address 3/4 inches up then. I could not find a print sample with barcode, but it should fit this way.

Could you please confirm if envelope 4403 is used for the coupon. I could not find this info in SOW.

There may be a similar problem in wecumv1:

barcode, if generated, will be too low to be read properly; I suggest moving the address up at least 1/8 inch.

Could you please make samples for mv1 and ml1 so that they include barcodes?

Address positions of *wecums1*, *wecumv1, wecuml1* are same as production. I didn't make any changes to these resources. I just replaced the top left side logo of first page by the new logo.

From the SOW. I do not show we are using a return envelope for the loan application. I also found this line in the SOW.
 # No IMB needed since client is not using courtesy reply envelopes.

comment: [~Kbittmann]maybe I am naming them wrong.

Kindly look at this sample:
[^wecuml11114.2o1.pdf]

At the bottom of page 1 there is a coupon that the receiver is supposed to detach and mail.

Are they supposed to use envelopes of their own?

comment: I checked with PC: WECU don't use non-standard envelopes. So if the recipient mails something back, it's 4403.
