I have a question regarding this ticket.

1. There was another business logic for this client e.g. if there is any user account that's paperless status is paper then the user can't log in to hypercube! For that one, if the user has multiple accounts then will it check for a paper on all of them and if find one account with paper then hypercube will show regular "appNotFound" page! Right?



Thanks,

Sadman

comment: Hi Sadman,

What we can do is first check if the account exists in our database. Then afterwards check if the account is on electronic.

Any accounts that don't exist in our database or are not on electronic will not be passed in to our account list api.



On a separate note, for users that aren't enrolled, can we direct them to a new global page that can be configured to display a custom message that the client would like displayed to let the user know to enroll in the online banking vendor website?



Let me know if you have any questions.

We will only be checking if the user is enrolled. If the user is enrolled they will hit the home page like currently expected. If the user is not enrolled, then we will redirect them to the new global template page that will prompt the user to enroll in the online banking vendor website and then try again after to view statements.

Let's also have the template page be customizable if the client chooses to change verbiage.

Thanks
