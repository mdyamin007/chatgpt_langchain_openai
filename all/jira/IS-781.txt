comment: Hi [~dyuen]

I couldn't find any data file with letter 010 ( Loan Final Demand), I only found with letter 005(60-Day DQ). Would it be possible to provide a data file with the letter 010.



isd Index file:dna_20220103_1_20220207_0205_spcu.txt. Please provide this to isd to post in stage and ask to provide sample with account no1360186 which is a 005 letter.



Attached is the dpvs . Please ask print sample for 4.2o1 there is only 2 accounts and one is for 005.

comment: Hi [~rony], I can't request print samples until QA has reviewed samples and/or client has approved. I will keep the print request on hold until we get a test data file for letter 010.

Thanks

comment: HI [~rony], SPCU responded with the following:

"there is actually an example in the 02/08 Collection Notice file you received. Look for Account Number 1400655. Attached is section from the 02/08/22 Collection Notice file for this example."

Can you check the data file from this date/yesterday?

Thanks

parallel id:20220203073701

dpvs[^spcudna103-1.print], 2d prefix sci , print 4.2o1 , only 2 accounts there , one for 005.

dpvs[^spcudna203.print]2d prefix sch , print 4.2o1 , only 1 account is there, 010.



Index files:

[^dna_20220103_2_20220210_2315_spcu.txt] for letter 010

[^dna_20220103_1_20220210_2317_spcu.txt] for letter 005



Don't need to post, it's just for you to check those 2 letters 005 and 010 are appearing in those index files. The main point is adding esup_ignore in the control file to prevent suppressing from print.



Thanks

comment: [~rony], Is there a sample I can provide SPCU other than the DPVS?

[~Igor.Khosid], I updated SOW, but funny enough it already showed that these two notices are flagged as "Both" (paper and eNotice).
