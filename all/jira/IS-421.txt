author: phoebe.george
comment: [~mousumiS] thanks, we'll review.

[~enricob] can you help me review data portion and confirm if okay to send to customer. I'm checking cosmetic review now. Thanks!


author: enricob
comment: Samples looks good


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~mousumiS] [~enricob] thanks, samples have been sent to customer; feedback due by 10/15. Thanks!


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~fahad] [~mousumiS] [~enricob] MVCU has approved the samples! Please let me know next steps. I updated the timeline noting the approvals were received, but I know that you probably need to complete coding for the overall program still. Please note that for this first launch of notices, only these two notices will be included. Let me know next steps, and/or target date for when you may be able to prepare the DPVS for print samples. Thank you!

Thanks.

comment: Hi [~phoebe.george],
I've updated the ticket.
As today was due date for this Jira ticket. Please extend the due date for this Jira ticket.
Thanks.


author: william.kong
comment: [~phoebe.george]: Looks like parallel was initiated yesterday. Do you think this parallel will be completed by 12pm PST? If so, i need to ask [~fahad]to prepare the program transfer form if it passes. Please advise.



[~anwarh]/[~rony]: Please alert [~fahad] about the parallel run issue and to prep the program transfer form in the event we still need to commit to the 12/31/2021 live date which as to be released today since Office is closed tomorrow.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~fahad] There is a processing error on the MPT that I messaged on to check and respond on the ticket. In the turnover meeting, OPS will try to complete by today, but that was before the error message, so they will confirm if it can still be completed. If not, will need to move the parallel testing date to be completed after 1/5/22 at earliest.


author: JIRAUSER10910
comment: Hi [~phoebe.george],

I'm still working on it now.. to generate the same error.
I'll inform you as soon as possible.
Thanks.


author: william.kong
comment: [~fahad]: Any new updates on your progress? I don't think we will be able to release this project today.



[~phoebe.george]: FYI. We may need to hold their processing until this is resolved.


author: JIRAUSER10910
comment: HI [~William.Kong],
I've just fixed the issue and update the code in parallel.. also let Alex know in TS ticket.
Should I proceed to Release without parallel completion?
Thanks.


author: william.kong
comment: [~fahad]: We cannot release code until parallel is completed. OPS is working this weekend so if they do some parallel it 'might' finish this weekend. Per my zoom chat earlier, please still include Program Transfer form so that we do not have chase for it on Monday.

comment: [^IS_421_PROGRAM_TRANSFER_FORM.doc]

Hi [~William.Kong] / [~yameelee]/ [~phoebe.george] ,
I've attached the Transfer form and also did the cvs checkin. All the resources are in my xfer directory (/d/is/cvs/xfer/fahadK/ )
As this is still in parallel. So I didn't change the Jira status to "Release Ready".
Thanks.


author: william.kong
comment: [~yameelee]: Per our conversation, we need to wait for Parallel to be completed. Please do NOT release this project. Thank you for checking in with me on this one!!!
