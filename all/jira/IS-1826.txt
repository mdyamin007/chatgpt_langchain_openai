title: As there is no invalid address report, should we handle .mis ?
description: Normally, the invalid address is auto handled and goes to rpt. It is not our hand, But in SOW, it is pointed to .mis file. Should we keep it .rpt?

comment: [~mousumiS] For the invalid address, no report is required.

For STAR setup, invalid address goes to 'MIS' file, which is just a normal print file that OPS will handle to print and mail at Full First Class rate. No .rpt file is required:
