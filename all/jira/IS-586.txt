Here is the sample:[^SURU_Upfront_stmt_102721_071153.txt.pdf]

One side note: We usually pick all keys as unique, but if a certain key can appear multiple times, we need to know this beforehand. In this case, it was 'CA'

Thanks

Its value is printed on a separate line. "Credits/Adjustments" is hardcoded text.

So, if "CA" is "Change Order Adjustment" we put the value in "Credits/Adjustments" line?
Do I also need to print the line below?
Please confirm.

Thanks
