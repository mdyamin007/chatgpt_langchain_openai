QA completed

The letter was updated as per the customer's request. However, it has some grammatical issues. The same problems were in the previous version.
Please check :

Customer's comments "LCCUDL001_Production_template with comments - MHaley.pdf" :
{color:#de350b}Receive an additional.40% Annual Percentage Yield (APY) on share certificates if you have a La Capitol checking account. (Excludes 91 day and 6-month terms.) Additional .40% APY remains in effect for term of share certificate as long as checking account is open. If checking account is closed, the additional .40% APY will be removed from the certificate. Offer subject to change without notice."{color}

Corrected version should be:
{color:#00875a}Receive an additional.40% Annual Percentage Yield (APY) on share certificates if you have a La Capitol checking account. (Excludes 91 day and 6-month terms.) *{color:#de350b}An{color}* additional.40% APY remains in effect for *{color:#de350b}the{color}* term of share certificate as long as *{color:#de350b}the{color}* checking account is open. If the checking account is closed, the additional.40% APY will be removed from the certificate. Offer subject to change without notice."{color}

Ignore the "the" changes. Just go ahead with what was approved prior.
