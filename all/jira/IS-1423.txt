title: CAMB - [31448][pvt][in-house] DP -- CAMB PDF 8/8/22 Redtitan errors
description: This issue appears to be related to our internal tools where the version of software used to parse the pdf (RedTitan) results in a segmentation fault when parsing this specific pdf data file. I will need to make an update to use a more recent RedTitan version.

Note: Memory issue with RedTitan is related to howcamb_wire_080822.pdf is version 1.7 as opposed to version 1.6 (courtesy of Terrence).

This hotfix is ready for review. Once QA is complete, I will proceed with releasing this fix.
