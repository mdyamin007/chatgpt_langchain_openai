comment: Will,



The processed exit with this error - Error. Failed to create archival. Exiting



Archival was not created.





Thanks,
Rogelio

comment: [~rogelio_jira]; Thanks for submitting this issue. I will need more time to provide resolution. Jun is setting up a separate database to address this issue so that we do not have to temporarily re-write the code to only support Brisbane.



I will keep this ticket assigned to me for now.

Thanks!

comment: [~anil.dasa] and [~shailendrar]: Can you review the error message InfoSYNC is providing. It looks like it is not able to submit. Is the indexfileprocess up in brisbane?


author: anil.dasa
comment: [~William.Kong]

ca-jobtrack-pr-01 indexFileprocess was down earlier. I have made application up now. Can you try to submit job now.


author: william.kong
comment: [~anil.dasa]: Thanks for the update. Unfortunately we cannot re-test as we are moving license to test a different server. I will keep this ticket open for the next week or two.


author: william.kong
comment: [~rogelio_jira]: Can you please re-test this job in production? We have activated the production license last night on RHS to resume testing.

The reprocessed DPVS is not good did not have the breakdown of the print files.

This is also showing at the end of the processed:

comment: [~rogelio_jira]: Thanks for reporting this issue!



[~Terrence.Tong]: Can you please have someone else to work on this ticket? Eric is OOO so i don't know who to research to the two issues.

Two concerns I have:



#1. I thought our production code in Brisbane was commented out to+not+ send files to client; Please have our team comment out the code first (see screenshot #2 from previous comment).



#2. Please have team research why dpvs does not have break down (see screenshot #1 above.)

comment: Ernest,

Does the following error has to do with ACE?

 !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! 

frstd117.c1bmcok is empty


I also disable all the sftp from frst_process.sh


author: william.kong
comment: [~ernestw]: Can you review this ticket also?




author: william.kong
comment: [~ernestw]: Thanks for the assistance! The bb-rhs2:/d/ncoa_dirs was not pointing to ca-rhstore-pr-01:/d/ncoa_dirs/. So the last few reported issues a few weeks ago was related to it.



[~rogelio_jira]: Please re-test.

Reprocessing is good now - DVPS is with breakdown but we still cannot scan the job in datatrac.

comment: [~Terrence.Tong]: Please update ticket once you have a resolution with Mimi, PC and/or Rogelio on the DataTRAC scanning problem.


author: william.kong
comment: [~rogelio_jira]: Looks like this scanning issue is resolved per the following ticket:



https://jira.infoimageinc.com/browse/IBTL-156



Can you please verify and update smartsheet when you are done today? Thanks!

I was able to scan the job now in 10.4.32.166:
