Print samples requested.


author: william.kong
comment: [~Kbittmann]: Do we have client approval? Please advise. The live date is Friday, 11/5. If approvals are not received, then please get approvals before EOD today. Thursday, we will need to rush parallel in order to make the 11/5 release date (please get OPS approval to rush parallel Thursday).



If any of these dates are missed, timeline is no longer valid and we will need to revisit a new timeline..

Samples are not approved yet. I sent a follow up to the client.


author: william.kong
comment: [~Kbittmann]: Live date of 11/5 is no longer valid. We will need to revisit timeline, but this project needs to go live by EOM or earlier. Otherwise it will potentially delay to next year.


author: kdishroon
comment: [~lemoy28] - We received client approval on the samples.


author: william.kong
comment: [~kdishroon]/[~Kbittmann] : I will need to work with [~lemoy28]to see if we can fit this release on or before 12/15/2021. Apparently, I did not provide you a revised November timeline above when I stated:

"[~Kbittmann]: Live date of 11/5 is no longer valid. We will need to revisit timeline, but this project needs to go live by EOM or earlier. Otherwise it will potentially delay to next year."

comment: [~kdishroon]& [~Kbittmann]:



Here is the revised timeline:

12/3/2021: Export project & send to [~Igor.Khosid]for QA

12/6/2021: Initiate Parallel with IS & ISD & DP & OPS

12/8/2021: Complete Parallel.

12/9/2021: Go Live



Please note: This project+cannot+ go past 12/9/2021. Le is on vacation for two weeks and we will not have support for this app.

The client says this needs to be live ASAP due to compliance. However, they want it to go live with TS ticket 24418. Currently, under review.


author: william.kong
comment: [~Kbittmann]: I'm confused. TS 24418 is related to this project; I don't see another project. If there is another project to go live with, please advise which other Jira ticket and the live date for this other project.

But in the meantime, we will adhere to the timeline presented above. Unfortunately, they were late with approvals (i.e. instead of 11/5 down to 11/19) and the follow-ups we made with them to warn them of the approval date..

24418 hasn't made it to Jira status yet. So that is why you don't see it. I was updating this ticket to inform you the 2 tickets are now related and must go live together as soon as possible. Please provide analysis and timeline for 24418 and I will alter this ticket to match the live date you provide.


author: william.kong
comment: [~Kbittmann]: I updated TS#24418. PLease get client to agree and approve our understand by 10am Friday PST / 12pm CST. It is imperative they respond timely.


author: william.kong
comment: [~Kbittmann]: Just a reminder, we needed a response on this from SNFB. Please advise asap so that we can meet the timeline.
