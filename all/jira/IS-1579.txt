comment: [~eric.yan]We are waiting for the mailer ID to be linked to GMBK cid. Once that is done we can run with tracking. We have an internal meeting with OPS today to figure all this out since I believe OPS is the dept that possibly handles that part.

comment: [~rodriguez] - Hi Leo, I reviewed the pdf on Account Management and the output looks blotchy, low quality. Can this be fixed?

comment: Hi [~andreav]if it can be fixed it would have to be from ISD since they convert the AFP file to PDF for estatements. When looking at the AFP file, the blotchiness is not there, so looks like the issue is when ISD converts the PDF. IS only converts the AFP to PDF for archival and that PDF is fine. Please see links below of AFP file and Archival PDF. FYI [~eric.yan]

comment: [~andreav] [~eric.yan]UPDATE: I manually converted the estatement AFP to PDF using the IS conversion tool and there is no blotchiness. This leads me to believe that the issue is with the ISD conversion tool. Please see image below.

comment: Ready for the client review


author: andreav
comment: [~rodriguez] - - Client has approved InfoTRAC and the API set up. Please provide QA what they need to start reviewing.
They have decided to only pre-ingest back to core conversion live date as per original scope.
However, for the taxes, they do want to post the 2021 1098 tax form by Dec 2023 and they will give us the old archival and updated index for to process and post. I will create a separate ticket for this effort.
