comment: [~alexw]: I'm going up "Skip" this app. The script you are clicking requires \\dell-2100\share to be mapped. Unfortunately I cannot map this server. Hosein reported this issue to me as well.



We will have to wait for conversion weekend for dell-2100 to be brought over to brisbane and also this temporary ca-rtitan-pr-04 server to be replaced.

comment: [~alexw]: I need to ask Peter to re-assign another RedTitan job to re-test.



[~Peter.Dang]: Can you assign a different RedTitan job where the script does not require "Dell-2100\share\" server?
