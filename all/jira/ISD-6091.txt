title: Processing UI - Bypass DT Job ID search 
description: None

comment: To QA,

For Afp, Document, Enotice, Enotice4 and Etax processes, DT Job ID search bypassing is implemented on STAGE environment. Now, there will be a checkbox labeled "By Pass Dt_jobId search" while selecting the index file. By checking it, the process will not search for the DT job id.

Please process the following index file in test mode (Parallel Run) and test this feature.
||CID||Process||Index file||
|CAMB|Afp|me1_09302021_1_10182021_2309_camb.txt|
|BRIL|Document|ms1_20200621_1_20200916_1325_bril.txt|
|MOCU|Enotice|mocu_07292021_11112021_192618_mocu.txt|
|BANB|Enotice4|banb_afp_enotice_03202021_110022_1.txt|
|MWCU|Etax|etax_1099int_12312021_311_11052021_153956_mwcu.txt|

Thanks

I do not have any available resources for testing, and as per our conversation today with David, please use your off-shore QA members.
