title: SPCU  Bad Email Monthly Statements
description: Create Bad Email Monthly Statement Processing application for the spcums3 program. Please clone the spcums2_process.sh and make the adjustments accordingly. I'm assuming the new jid will be ms4.

ISD will be make their update for the /d/ftpbu/spcubu/bad_estmt_email/spcu_*{color:#ff0000}ms1{color}*_undeliverable_1_MMDDYYYY_HHMMSS.txt.pgp file to use the new ms3 prefix (e.g.:

/d/ftpbu/spcubu/bad_estmt_email/spcu_{color:#ff0000}*ms3*{color}_undeliverable_1_MMDDYYYY_HHMMSS.txt.pgp)



Please create procedure file in /home/procs/spcums4.procs; Unfortunately we did not create one for spcums2.procs, so you will need to document from scratch.



No pilot/sample needed for this project.

No Client Approval needed.

Parallel is required to be tested with ISD.
