Please review and confirm if it is ready for the client review

comment: The update works.
I can make one remark: "call 1-800- 342-9647 (toll free from the United States)" text in the last paragraph was meant to be emphasized in the original color version, but in black-and-white it's somewhat grayed out. 
!grey text.png!
As a suggestion, that may be fixable (increasing contract in a selected area of the image, or changing text color in the original PDF file, if we have the tools).
 But I think it also works as it is.

Can we fix the area [~avannik]pointed out?

comment: [~MattL] - That portion was color in the pdf and when I converted to pseg it is lighter. Client has to change the pdf if they want it darker.

Thanks!
