comment: [~eric.yan], SEFC no longer needs to the PDF sent to their client pickup. However, they do want the letters suppressed.

Per SEFC: "Our Account Ops team reviewed the output and stated they don't need this PDF after all. They do want to start suppressing these bounceback mailings as soon as possible though."

Please proceed with the update to suppress the "DO NOT MAIL" letters, and disregard the PDF portion.

Thanks


author: dyuen
comment: [~eric.yan], please confirm that code is on track to release tomorrow. As noted above, SEFC does NOT need the PDF file anymore, they only need the letters with "DO NOT MAIL" suppressed.

Thanks

Code is released to production. "Do not mail" letters are suppressed only and won't generate pdf return file.
