comment: We have not only one BGP configuration. For the Brisbane BGP setup, we are waiting for AT&T to add [mcit@infoimageinc.com|mailto:mcit@infoimageinc.com]into the Internet circuit accounts. They will do it today and I will open a ticket to complete this item.



I will send a road-map document tonight, hopefully, regarding WAN and Internet transitions.
