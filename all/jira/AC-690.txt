title: GCBK - [29084][pvt] Switch accounts to Paper
description: Set up a Revert to Paper process for GCBK



#2: We have a Revert to Paper process which can take in an account list (similar to what they provided but probably with a couple tweaks) and switch those to paper. If we do set this up, then they can also utilize this for future similar requests. If GCBK is interested in this approach, we can have someone assess the work for it.
