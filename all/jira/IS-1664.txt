title: SEFC One Off Letter 203 Fix
description: SEFC One Off Letter 203 Fix

- Parallel required: (no) Make sure QA for ALL letter 203 accounts are in archival file, in print file.
- Application name: SEFCDLE

1. Export the esup_ignore in control file. This makes the letter 203 always print.

2. Include the letter 203 in PDF archval.

I have a question about the archival index file.
all other daily letter is using the borrower name on the index file.
but for letter 203. 1 borrower may have 1 or more hazard payees.
And the letter mailing address is using the hazard payee name and address.
which name should I use for letter 203? the borrower name or hazard payee name?

comment: [~zhuoxinT]- Use Hazard Payee name and address.
