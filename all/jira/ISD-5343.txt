title: APCU - [22428][pvt] Regulatory Change to Visa Welcome Letters
description: Attached are the new templates for the Visa Welcome Letters (Disclosures). Its really only the Truth in Lending (TIL) that has been updated. Below you can see the current (old) vs the new changes. I said none of the variables have been changed and it was just the static information on the first and second page of the TIL and that is basically true, but we can now ignore field 18 in the data file. See below but we can stop including the MLA page depending on whats in field 18 going forward.

Please waive the 1 hour for ISD due to it not being included in original P/R.
