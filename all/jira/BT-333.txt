I moved the return address up a little bit. I don't think we can move it up by much because there should be about 0.2 inches free space on the top so the logo doesn't get cut off. Please request new print samples to check if it's better.

The 2d prefix on that scanned image don't match with the DPVS attached from previous comment. Please get print samples from the DPVS attached on this bug ticket.

Looks good - marking this as fixed.
