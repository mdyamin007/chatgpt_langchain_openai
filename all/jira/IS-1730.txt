title: STAR: PDF Daily Notice Setup (Print and Electronic)
description: Set-up new application for STAR PDF daily notices.

NOTE: There is a separate project for 'regular' daily notices already using 'dla' as the prefix.

Setup is for print and electronic (no PDF archival required).

Reference SOW attachment (rather than link); if SOW is updated, new attachment will be added and previous version deleted.

Reference Timeline link (to be updated after turnover).

Mapping/Test files:

The mappings are in SharePoint: InfoShare > Account Services / IM > Mapping Documents > STAR - Star Financial Bank > PDF_Notices_2022

The data I used is organized here: share:\albertM\star\notices\cc_pdf_notices\test_data_20221010

ATTACHED:
 # Copy of STAR DN/Return address; can be used same as current DN setup (dla).
 # EHL Logo for bottom right corner for all notices.
 # Member FDIC Logo for bottom right corner for all notices.
 # Copy of Paperless File (same file used for all STAR applications for eSUPP)



DT JOB ID's:

DT_JOB_ID (stage) = 134195-C18.01-V22837

DT_JOB_ID (pilot) = 139528-C18.01-V22898

comment: [~SamV2021] Thanks, I have requested print samples from OPS.

comment: [~SamV2021] Attaching OPS Print samples; tap test passed.

Attaching APPROVED samples also.

[~Igor.Khosid] FYI - just pending pilot site approval now.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~SamV2021] We have approval to move forward from the pilot site! 

Let me know when you can prep for QA; I'm going to try and push for launching next week if possible! They were trying to go live as of 11/21 for the regular PDF notices, and want to try to come as close to that as possible :)

Thank you for your help with this and all the rush effort you put into it!

[~Igor.Khosid] FYI

Please proceed with testing >> Print and electronic, no archival
The samples (2) already approved and attached

[~phoebe.george] - wondering if the eSite - approved?


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~Igor.Khosid] Sorry, I meant to pass over my ISD story to QA as well. I wanted to clarify with phoebe about whether we need to have job status checked, since I ran into issues reposting one of the files and had to bypass the dtjobid for it to post.

[~phoebe.george] I forget if we went over this already, can you confirm again whether we need all three postings to show under job status?


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] Sorry, I forgot to update you that PC enabled eStatement tracking in all environments so that it should display now!

comment: [~phoebe.george] I tried reposting dna_20221017_1_20221115_1621_star.txt on stage but I'm still receiving an error 'infoTrac_flag is on but dt_job_id is missing from dataTrac(IS) database'. We may need a new dtjobid, [~SamV2021] can you check on this? Thanks

For dna_20221017_1_20221115_1621_star.txt in staging, I believe it is because the input file is dated 10/17/2022, so the DT_JOB_ID used is: 134195-C17.01-V22837, which does not exist in the PC database.

This applies to all 3 cycles I processed, so I think we'll need cycles 17, cycle 20, and cycle 25 DT_JOB_IDs created in both staging and pilot.

[~phoebe.george]Could you request these from PC?

Thanks,
 Sam
