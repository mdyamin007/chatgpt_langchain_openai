comment: Thomas,

Customer has approved the Monthly Stmt samples. They added the comment:

"The statements have been approved by our Marketing team. As a reminder, the October 2021 statements (produced on the first of November) will have the old logo on them. The first statement batch with the new logo will be the November 2021 statements."

comment: [~thomasY] Client approved the samples for the monthly statements; please provide the DPVS so I can request print samples and proceed with QA.


author: william.kong
comment: [~thomasY]: This application is approved. Please initiate with QA so that we can release before the end of this week.


author: kdishroon
comment: [~William.Kong] and [~thomasY] Please note that code CANNOT be released prior to 11/1. The client wants code released ON 11/1.


author: william.kong
comment: [~thomasY]: I did not realize WTCU has a few cycles that process during the last few days of the month. I thought this was a Monthly job. Please release code on 11/1 per [~kdishroon]'s instructions.



[~kdishroon]: please ensure this is communicated to DP as well to hold processing until [~thomasY]releases the code on Monday morning.

comment: [~kdishroon] [~William.Kong] From Bill's comment, it sounds like they want the logo update to start *after* the file is processed on the Nov. 1st (Dec. 1st cycle?)


author: kdishroon
comment: [~thomasY] - Yes, that is correct.

[~thomasY]

author: thomasy
comment: [~kdishroon]Do we need to resize this logo as well?


author: kdishroon
comment: [~thomasY]- They already approved monthly statements but I will ask to confirm.


author: kdishroon
comment: Per the client, they would also like the same change to the monthly statements as the Heloc:

"Reduce logo size 10-15% and add space between bottom of logo and top of address. Ideal is 1 "x" height of "Westerra" safe space around logo."

*To clarify on 1 "x" height of "Westerra" safe space around logo; there should be the same amount of white space around all 4 sides of the logo. Attached is the style guide if needed. [^REB21-055_WCU_BrandStyleguide_V1.1_EXTERNAL (1).pdf]

comment: Hi [~thomasY] -

Since the logo is under 1.25 please use this logo with the enlarged Credit Union [|https://www.dropbox.com/t/YWnceIXDV1L2mxtk]

comment: [~thomasY]: Spoke with[~kdishroon]. This also needs to go live by 11/1 as well.

Any update on the laser samples?

Is this update for the paper site only?


author: kdishroon
comment: Hi [~berezinez],

It is print and e, however, we just received approval late on Friday; I don't know that OPs will be able to print these now since it's month-end. The client is going to approve the live samples so we are skipping parallel.

comment: [~thomasY]

please provide an Index file for Stage verification.


author: william.kong
comment: [~berezinez]: Spoke with [~kdishroon]. This is just a logo update. [~kdishroon]will have client review output in production before OPS releases to production.



[~thomasY] : I just spoke with [~kdishroon], please go ahead and work with [~TunA]to release the Monthly Statement code now. Once completed, please let [~kdishroon]know so that she can update DP/PC to proceed with processing.
