IMB barcode is missing on print samples and heavies print samples,, please advise: should it be added?


author: mahbubs
comment: Hi Alis,

Ran the process today in parallel.

Please use attached DPVS.[^ufcums1130.print]

And use the afp file/z/afp/ufcu/ufcums11304.2o1.afp for barcode check.

print range: 1-20

Heavies should not have IMB bar code.

Thanks

Mahbub - any updates on the logo position?


author: mahbubs
comment: Hi Igor,

I heard that UFCUEA1 is approved and tap test passed.

And i observed that the vertical position of MS1 logo matches with EA1.

So i only updated the horizontal position of the MS1 logo.

Attached is the DPVS.[^ufcums1130.print]

Use same print range like my previous mail.

Thanks

comment: [~Igor.Khosid]: Please advise if you new physical samples were reviewed. I would like [~mahbubS]to release code Friday morning so client can submit Message Manager next week and not scramble. Please advise.

Waiting for the print samples

My understanding - they are requested

However, we still need to go through the parallel testing
