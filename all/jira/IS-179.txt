comment: 7/20 Hi Eric, I wanted to follow up with you on the status of this JIRA story 


author: eric.yan
comment: [~barnetts]
Could you confirm if the two letter should be setup separately (two letter codes) or together (one letter code)

I'll provide sample by 7/27.


author: barnetts
comment: Hi Eric, are we on track for samples tomorrow? 


author: barnetts
comment: Hi Eric, UTCU wants this setup as 1 letter if possible (together with one code). If this creates issues please have it as 2 letters. 


author: barnetts
comment: HI Eric, changed their mind they want 2 separated letters


author: eric.yan

The sample from both letters are available. But there are some issue on the data file format to be fixed.
utcudl015 - close letter
data file: 06-03-2021 LOC Removal List
* some record's data field is not consistent.
* data file has no 'bad address' indicator
 !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! 

utcudl016 - lower credit letter
data file: 06-07-2021 Inactive CC List
* missing letter date in the datafile

comment: Hi Eric,
Can you please advise about samples for test/Inactive_cc_close.zip / 15.35 kb (06/21/2021 11:45 PST)

comment: [~barnetts]

I read the client asked what wording is needed for the bad address field. Basically any wording is fine as long as the file content and position are consistent, for example "Y/N'.

The DL 016 sample is ready.
Please also advise what is the APP_ID for the inactive credit letter?



author: eric.yan
comment: [~barnetts]

The due day is Aug 9th but the client has approved yet. Can we extend the live day by a week.
I'll be away next week Monday - Wednesday 8/9 - 8/11. If the client could approve sample by Friday, I can move it to QA right away.


author: barnetts
comment: Due date is updated 


author: barnetts
comment: Hi [~eric.yan],

Per UTCU, for DL 016 
* Please remove the extra spacing around the verbiage: "to the"
* Please update the verbiage: 
  From: spend
  To: spending

So the new verbiage should look like
Before: today due  to  the past 12 months the spend activity
After: today due to the past 12 months the spending activity

The mockup is attached.  [^UTCU_DL16_changes_08.06.21.pdf]

comment: [~eric.yan], do we have an index file generated? I noticed there's a few index files that failed to post on stage on 8/6 such as dla_20210726_1_20210806_1432_utcu.txt, these never posted because there are no account numbers in the file.

comment: Thanks [~eric.yan], the file auto posted successfully on stage. I checked a few accts for both notices 015 and 016 and I do see the description showing. I posted it onto pilot as well and can see the descriptions there too.

[~berezinez], can you double check and confirm the notice descriptions are showing on infotrac pilot/stage before we proceed with parallel? Here's a few accts for both types of notices:

015 - 200122536397, 200110195497, 200129159797
016 - 200120239497, 200124025997, 200120266597

Thanks,
Shun

comment: [~barnetts], Alis confirmed the correct descriptions are showing, will proceed with parallel.

comment: [~barnetts]: Just a FYI. [~eric.yan]informed me that Parallel is today. There is a risk we may not release the code today in time for this weekend/Monday processing. If this has to be released today, we need to expedite the Parallel processing.  If so, please assist in communicating.  thanks!


author: william.kong
comment: [~barnetts]: Just a fyi. Parallel is still pending and live date is missed as discussed above.
