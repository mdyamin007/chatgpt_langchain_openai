Note: I was unable to find a recent data file for fffcdlc with letter 51, so samples were generated with an old data file found in project folder.

Verified the attached samples for below DL's, inline insert disclosure are good .Ready for Client Review
FFFCDL002,FFFCDL051,FFFCDL052 .

comment: Hi [~Natalie.Tom] [~gthillaivel]

Client has two questions regarding this:

One, is when do we need this approved by for this to be effective by August 30th? Two, in the samples we are reviewing, the disclosure is a separate page and not on the backside of the first page making it duplex.Just want to confirm.

1. From the assessment above, the approval date is 8/24.
2. Also from the assessment, "Add inline insert disclosure as simplex last page". Yes, the disclosure is a separate page simplex.

Are there any updates on approval?


author: JIRAUSER11103
comment: [~Bryanl]
The approval date has been missed and this application still needs to finish QA and go through parallel so it seems the live date, 8/30, will be missed as well.


author: bryanl
comment: Hi [~Natalie.Tom]

Per client:

It was approved!

Please let me know the new timeline as to when they will go live. I will need to change verbiage on our end of the existing notice.

Thanks!

As EOM is coming up, new live date will be 9/12.

Archival folder is available for test /d/pdf_afp/FFFC, the same should be created in prod /z/pdf-afp/FFFC, right now there is no folder created

Print samples looks good and the test results are in the location

The archival folder is actually only seen in the production folder, not test and test folders are /z/ and production folders are /d/.

Also the checklist attached is for the wrong jira, you attached one for IS-1350.
