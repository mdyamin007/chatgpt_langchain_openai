title: EWBB - [33042][pvt][in-house] Mortgage Statement Account Number Update (ML1)
description: Hot fix for Mortgage Loans (ML1 and Ml2 applications):

Loan number'6810004737' is 10 characters long while our mortgage billing statement formatting program currently expects up to 9 characters. So, the loan number is being truncated to '810004737' in the e-statement index file and individual afp filename.Update EWBBML11.dfa to correctly handle up to the maximum number of characters expected for variable 'ACCT_NUM'. 10 characters should be the maximum expected. If not, other mortgage applications may need to be updated as well.

Parallel ID: 20220913112317
I exported project file to QA folder EWBBML11.zip

The regression script for parallel regression test: 
ewbbml1_regression.sh

I have processed whole August data files in parallel environment.
There would be multiple estatement index files to post.

[~andyp]- Posted all the index file in stage and was sucessful

QA was not able to verify all the accounts with 10 digits, from all the index file posted, in stage.Randomly picked few account# from the index file and verified the Mortgage statement. Looks good.

Test results are in the location : \\dell-2100\qa\2022\03_Change Request\Gnana T\IS-1580 EWBB
