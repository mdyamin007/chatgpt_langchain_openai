comment: [~Kbittmann] I don't see a new logo file attached to this story, did the client ever provide one?

Its the sample statement pdf attachment. The client confirmed with Sean they could use the sample statement copy they use for marketing each month.

comment: [~Kbittmann] Per the description, this project is to update two things, the sample statement pdf and the logo on the admin site. I see the sample statement pdf, but I don't see any new logo file. If we're still updating the admin site logo, then we will need a new logo image file to replace the old one.

Please update the pdf sample for enrollment only.

comment: [~Kbittmann] Sample Statement is updated now on pilot. I attached a screenshot to this story in case the client does not have access to the pilot member site.

The client has decided to move forward with updating the admin site logo. They want to know the specs needed for providing logo. Could you please advise on this?


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~Kbittmann] The current file image size is 901 x 210 in .png format. Please have the client provide an image with those specs if possible.

comment: [~Kbittmann] It looks like we're still waiting on client approval, but can we push out the live date? Maybe something like 11/9 for now since it does require code release/server restart so wed is ideal. Thanks

11/9 will work.


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~Kbittmann] Thanks. I'm aiming to move the updates over to stage by wed 11/2 so I can give QA enough time to test. If the client can provide the logo file within the next few business days and approve the change by 11/2, I think we can comfortably meet 11/9.

Please review TS 33993 for updated logo. Could not attach here.

comment: [~Kbittmann] I'll work on this today, will have it out by eod today since I need to restart the pilot servers for this.

comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid], this project consists of updating the sample statement pdf during enrollment and the logo on the admin site. Below are instructions on testing stage:

Sample Statement pdf
1. Go to SSO test page. For the user_fi_number field, use any unenrolled member number. Here are some examples you can use: 70142889, 100003560. The other fields can remain the same/proceed as usual.
2. You should land on step 1/3 of enrollment which should present the new sample statement pdf. Please verify that it matches the SampleStatement.pdf attached to this story. I attached an image of the old sample statement for reference to compare against, mvcu_old_sample_statement.PNG.

Admin site logo:
1. Access the stage admin site. Upon landing on the login page, you should see a logo on the top left. The new logo should match the IHMVCU_Logo_901x210.png attached to this story. The old logo is still on their production site if you need a reference.

Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks

Works - as expected

comment: Thanks [~Igor.Khosid]!

[~Kbittmann], not sure if you saw my zoom message but since this passed QA quicker than I expected, I can technically still release this to production today if the client is ok with that. If not that's fine, we can stick with the 11/16 release date. Let me know how we should proceed, thanks.

comment: Per zoom, I'll release this to production on 11/16.
