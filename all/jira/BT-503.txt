The ISD index file is already posted by system. So you have to undo it before posting it again. Also this should be processed by AFP Processing not Document Processing because this is old index file format and AFP Process deals with old index file format where else Document Process deals with new index file format. As you tried to process old index file format with Document Processing , it has thrown error for missing field. 
 Thanks.
