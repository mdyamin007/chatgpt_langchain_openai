I've placed the sample, ewbbms1_sample.pdf in Barnett's AC Secure shared directory.
I've attached the cripple reports from the parallel run for cycle 08/31.

comment: Error in message window as well as message is missing due to message manager file


author: nischala.manjunath
comment: [~gthillaivel], that's probably because the message manager file and the resource don't exist in your local file directory. The parallel run has it. Please look at the sample pdf I had provided earlier.

comment: [~kdishroon], can you try opening the uncompressed pdf - ewbbms1_sample.pdf instead? It's placed right below the zip file. I've also placed the pdf in your AC Secure Shared directory. 
Thanks!

comment: [~kdishroon]/[~nischala.manjunath]/[~Peter.Dang]: It's been over two months pending client response. We need to change status to "Hold". Please update status to "HOLD" when you have the scrum meeting.



We are in code freeze starting today. Please ensure to discuss with [~Peter.Dang]to see when Nischala next availability to resume this project before making any commitments back to EWBB.

comment: Hi [~nischala.manjunath],

Here is the client's feedback:

_"I would like to confirm that the basic logic of the programming did not change. The first validation would be the amount, account, routing and serial number. Then if there is no serial number the program will now look for the control number. If the correct control number is not found then it will cripple."_


author: nischala.manjunath
comment: [~kdishroon] - Yes, that is correct. Are we picking this back up?


author: nischala.manjunath
comment: The updates are still in parallel, we don't have to redo them. 
Will ask network to recover check image files from last month to reprocess.


author: william.kong
comment: [~nischala.manjunath]/[~Peter.Dang]: According to the IS Upcoming Resource report, it states 3/15/2022 and not 3/9/202*3.* I've fixed this Jira due date to match up.

comment: [~nischala.manjunath] - Is this story just pending parallel?


author: nischala.manjunath
comment: [~kdishroon] - I don't think we're going to run a parallel test for this. I'm testing it myself, I'll check with Peter on what the next steps are. 


author: nischala.manjunath
comment: [~Igor.Khosid] [~gthillaivel] - Made an update to PRINT_CHK_VT_EWBB.dfa to extract the image with check number 0 if the control number doesn't match. Can you please verify if this looks ok? Reprocessing cycle 01/31 in parallel.  Thanks!
