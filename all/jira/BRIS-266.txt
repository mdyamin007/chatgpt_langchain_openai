title: ca-isilon01-nfs:/input-dv Folder Permission issue
description: [~davidt] and [~Tin.Chak]: Can you check and make sure there is no permission issue inside

ca-isilon01-nfs:/input-dv folders?



I used oper1 and cannot write to it.

comment: We ran into similar issue on another VM. I am asking Prem to check the permission on all the VM.
