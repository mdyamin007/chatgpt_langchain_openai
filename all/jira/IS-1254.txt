*Description*: Add selective message on the bottom of the statement for selective accounts. This will be from 06/30 - 07/01. The message will need to be back dated after month end.
The verbiage is listed below.

*Verbiage:*
Effective immediately, your new daily debit card spending limits are:
 ATM cash withdrawals: $1,010
 Debit card purchases with PIN: $3,500
 Signature purchases (select credit as the purchase type with your debit card when shopping in-person, or just shop as you normally would online): $7,500

If your card is lost or stolen, contact us immediately at 503-227-5571. If its after hours, call 503-423-8315 or 1-800-422-3132 (option 2) to report it. The important thing is to act fast. Once you report the loss of your card, you won't be held liable for unauthorized charges made afterward.

Tip: To stop fraud in its tracks, turn your card off/on instantly with the Unitus Card Guard mobile app; available on the App Store and Google Play Store.

Your Unitus Visa debit card comes with 24/7 fraud monitoring and Zero Liability protection from Visa, so you wont be held responsible for unauthorized card
