comment: Shun, there are no eStatements for this project. These inserts are not to be posted to "e". Please remove if you have posted them. Also, there seems to be an issue with this job as InfoTRAC is showing tons of eStatement jobs. Please fix.

comment: [~andreav] Most of those files were autoposted months ago and never removed. I've undone/removed all the estatement jobs for dtjobid 139023-C00.01-V22697. All you should see is 'eStmt job is currently running', which exists because estatement job tracking was initially enabled. If you need that removed too, maybe check with PC to see if they can disable estatement job tracking.

Since this is paper only, I'll close out this ticket.
