The statement file from EOM does contain that data, it just wasn't included in the statement.  Client provided the following account numbers would contain the verbiage. 

ACH Return Item example accounts:

         217737

         917048

         951549

         964666

 

Draft Return Item example accounts

         938097

         950820

         1028548

The word "draft" needs to be updated to the word "check", there is logic currently setup for this.  Please provide samples with this reflected. 

Client needs this to Go Live on 07/29
