comment: Current issue is that the report is running twice on the same scheduled date. 
It is schedules to run monthly on the 10th of each month.

The scheduler creates an instance the day before its scheduled at 4 pm, and then creates the instance again on the scheduled date. Both are on wakeup.

Then at 10 AM they both wakeup and are executed.



This is the only client on report scheduler that does this.

The code which should stop this from happening checks that create_time is not the same, as well as reportid, etc. But since one is created the day before it bypasses the logic.

comment: Hi Ethan,

Please take the latest code from file server with the following name: updateReportScheduler.pgp. I have removed the codes that causes issue. There was a pending item of the report scheduler where the occurrence is set to yearly. As one report was set to yearly this caused the issue.  I have removes some of the lines inside yearly check. I will develope the feature to work with yearly schedule as well. So far the updated code should not cause issue like scheduling multiple report for the same schedule.
