comment: [~hesham.hanna]:  Can you please migrate this machine over to 10.4.20.### network? Please re-assign ticket back to me when it is done. This is critical in order for us to configure IPAS in Brisbane to resume our testing.

Can you please try now. I have provided RDP and SSH access from your MP JS's to the BB JS

comment: [~hesham.hanna]: Thanks for create the temporary local account since this server cannot talk with the domain yet. I will update the spec above and keep this ticket open.



[~ernestw]: Please use VPN to RDP into this server. Hesham created local account for you:

comment: [~kent.chan]: False alarm. Ernest was able to log into his office PC and then RDP into the box. I've sent email to team to resume testing now that the license are configured with the new updated IP address.
