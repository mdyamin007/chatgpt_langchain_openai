comment: Here is the assessment for HOC pdf data file (plan A)

The document used true type font. There is no issue with font.

We can capture the anchor and recipient address lines.

We will print this document as is.



For printing simplex there will be no issue.



For printing duplex, we will have paging issue.

Basically, this document contained a package of declaration pages and several forms total 56 pages in this test. We cannot add extra blank page if the declaration pages ending in odd page (missing one blank even page). So the subsequent form will appear at the back of that even page.

This can be solved only if customer can add blank page inside the PDF.



For reference, I attached the output from the PCL format data file (using plan B).

This document had 28 pages. The reference blank page was at page 4, 6, 8 ...

I had reviewed the rest of pldec PDF data files for following variations: DFC, PAC and PXC

These data files were good to use.

These documents used true type fonts. We don't have any issue with font.

Output looked good.



For printing duplex, we have similar issue to add extra blank page(s) at the end of declaration pages and/or some other forms. We just print them as is.

We need customer to add blank page(s) into the PDF file where it need to be.

Attached was the sample of PL Decs.

The logo was extracted directly from Redtitan.

comment: Per customer feedbacks.

Hi Andy

The client reviewed the samples for Account Bills and PL Decs and provided some feedback. Please advise if these can be corrected. Some you already confirmed.


 # PL Decs  Missing insured name in address block. Client data or us?
 # PL Decs Heavy  Client stating print image is too much to the right side. Can this be adjusted?
 # Account Bills  Client asking if we can remove the old 3of9 barcode on page 2. I believe you already said we cannot mask this barcode on subsequent pages.
 # Account Bills  Client stating the E Pay copies are printing higher. I believe you already confirmed this is originating from client data. You made some adjustments so Billing Statement and Message box doesnt get truncated. This is related to the print margins being inconsistent.



*Wanda:* For PL Decs Heavy  16 pages or more will go into 9x12 envelope. That is our standard for heavy file.

comment: [~andyp] - Hi Andy, what is the status of updating the code to move the afp files to TX? When can we move to parallel? My understanding is that this need to go live on 8/12 so we need to rush this.

I make program update for moving data files from PLDecs zip to Texas Prisma print queue #16
Parallel ID: 20220811123300
We need QA code review.
I did a dry run with data file CAIG_pldecs_afp_08072022_1.zip.
The process working directory and log files were in
/z/daily/caig

The Texas print queue (test version) was
rh2_tx /z/caig/prisma_CAIG_PL_Decs
