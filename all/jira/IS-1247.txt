Is there any update in this app ?

The client is reviewing samples.


author: JIRAUSER10911
comment: [~rumanb]

Please see the below note from the client.

We need to update the index file names:

TheMVCU_Business_Loan_Statements_*.idx file format must instead beMvcuBusinessLoan_*.idx.

TheMVCU_CD_Notices_*.idx file format must instead beMvcuDailyNotices_*.idx.

After the change is made we will need another sample to confirm on our end for archiving.
