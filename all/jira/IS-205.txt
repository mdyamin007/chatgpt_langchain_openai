comment: [~barnetts]: We need to revise the project start date due to resourcing concerns.



Would it be possible to have the following timeline instead:



Start Code Date: 8/5/2021 (Fri)

Sample Date: 8/10/2021 (Tues)

Approval Date: 8/13/2021 (Fri)

Go Live: 8/17/2021 (Tues)



Please advise if this will be any concerns changing timeline expectations.

Per David,  [^UCCU_Indirect New Member and Adverse Action Letter_AC 95 IS 205_082021-Pass With Notes.pdf] 
Pass with notes.  Output matches samples provided and Ops checked for run ability.  But website verbiage is printing in color and subsequent pages printing on 1 line per.  See attached.
