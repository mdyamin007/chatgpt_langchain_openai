title: Unnecessary sentence when watching Disclosure (SSO|DSO).
description: # Log-in to the site (SSO|DSO) with the correct credentials
 # Click the item Disclosure
 Actual result: see screenshot.

 Expected result: When we click on "Disclosure" on the statement page, we do not need a sentence in the form that opens _"By clicking "Agree" below, you agree to the terms of this Agreement."_

When we click on "Disclosure" on the main menu tab, at the end of the disclosure, the following verbiage is shown -"By clicking "Agree" below, you agree to the terms of this Agreement." Also, there is no "Agree" button on this page to click into. Please check the screenshot.

This is an existing implementation before this task was initiated. As QA is reporting it as a bug, should I remove this line? Please advice.

Thank You!

Can we add the option to click on "agree", or does this disclosure show after the customer already agreed to it?

Thank you,

This disclosure on the menu tab shows after the user enrolls. We don't need to add any agree button there as they've agreed to it during enrollment.

comment: Thank you [~rifat.mahmud], I am assuming this sentence is a line on the disclosure document; do I need to request a new disclosure without that line or can we remove it on our end?

Yes, We can remove it from our end.

Actually, this line is not a part of the disclosure. It was added in the previous implementation, that's why I didn't remove it. Basically, it shows the users what they are agreeing into. We shouldn't display it in the menu disclosure section as this line serves no purpose there.

So, should we remove it?

Thanks,
