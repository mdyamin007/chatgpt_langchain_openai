title: RWCU - [33005][pvt][in-house] RWCU_NOTICES_DLA_Archival_MMDDYYYY_1.zip.001 Not Received for 08172022
description: For rwcudla this issue is happening again and again. Client is not seeing correct doc_date in index file. But when we run in parallel it seems ok. It happened multiple times that I asked Dp to manually in parallel and provide the archival file to client pickup.



Since this is daily each day archival zip file got replaced in /d/pdf_afp/rwcu/rwcudla/zip folder. And we provide pgp file in client pickup which I can't decrypt to check the index file content.



I changed in below scripts:

rwcu_notice_archival.sh
rwcudl_process.pl
rwcudla.control



Changes are:

1. add rwcudla.ran file. Previously ran file has not been generated. This is in rwcudl_process.pl.

2. used copytoclientpickup in rwcu_notice_archival.sh

3. added ftpserver to rwcudla.control file.



Additionally for now I added another thing in rwcu_notice_archival.sh to backup the zip file ( decrypted file ) in /d/download/rwcu/archvial/ folder. So that if client report issue in index file or pdfs I can't investigate the zip file. But after sometime I will remove this code, since this will occupy huge amount of space.



Would you please release those script.
