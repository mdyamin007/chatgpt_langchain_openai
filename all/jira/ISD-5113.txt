comment: Hi [~nprimak],

I've updated the disclosure tab name on SSO *pilot* from "Account Reconciliation" to "Statement Disclosures". Since I believe Igor is out, can you help me verify this change? You can use the prefilled values on the SSO test page when attempting to test.

When logging in, the "Statement Disclosures" tab should be only under the "Statements" tab, this is expected behavior for SANA. 

Thanks,
Shun
