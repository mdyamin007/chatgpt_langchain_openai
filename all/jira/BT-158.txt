comment: As per [~phoebe.george] request adding the following progress:

_Talked with SUCU today - they found why there are accounts missing on their end with the xref file and working to produce a new set to include those accounts that were missing. If you want to note as QA on hold, or back to in progress (for IS), please let us know. SUCU did not yet provide an ETA for the new xref file, as it requires programming on their end to update before re-creating. As soon as I have an ETA, will update everyone._
