comment: [~mamunur.rashid] From client on 8/11:
For Pre-enrollment, require members to accept disclosure, but no PDF and/or CAPTCHA.

[~diegof] - Please update confluence. 


author: andreav
comment: [~mamunur.rashid] - Can you confirm the date on when you will provide the external enrollment file sample? Will it be available via pilot?


author: mamunur.rashid
comment: [~andreav],

We need *hover* color schema.

For pre-enrolled users and the new users, SSO enrollment steps are the same. So if pre-enrolled users don't require PDF and/or CAPTCHA then new users will also don't accept PDF and/or CAPTCHA.

I haven't set up external enrollment file. Tomorrow I will set up it and will send you the sample file.

Thanks.


author: andreav
comment: [~mamunur.rashid] - Client confirmed OK to have users (both pre-enrolled and new) to accept disclosure and verify PDF. No CAPTCHA step for both.
Reminder to please provide the enrollment file sample.

Here is the sample file for external enrollment report:

author: mamunur.rashid
comment: [~andreav],

After adding custom date format I got the following file:

[^nacu_08172022_0134_extenrollment.txt]


author: andreav
comment: [~diegof] - Can you check the sample report and if good send to client for review and approval? I thought the report was standard and going to be posted on InfoTRAC Admin reports? Please let me know if this is not the case because we need to let the client know.


author: mamunur.rashid
comment: [~diegof], [~andreav] ,

I am attaching the new ext enrollment report file here that matches with the specs. You can send this file to the client.

[~andreav],

The paperless enrollment report in Infotrac will look like the picture below:

Below picture is the initial look of the site. We need hover color for all the buttons. We also need the verbiage for the sidebar.

author: andreav
comment: [~mamunur.rashid] - Client confirmed to use their orange for the hover. Also, she reported the blue on the screenshot looks more purple. Can you confirm you are using their colors per attached brand guide?

comment: [~mamunur.rashid] - I have included eSOWs in description. My latest updates are highlighted in blue in the eStatement SOW.


author: mamunur.rashid
comment: [~andreav],

I set up the blue color as the client said. I already deployed the code to pilot. If pilot proxy is set up for NACU pilot then the client can start testing.

comment: To QA,

Please do an initial review of the eStatement site (Hypercube) on the pilot environment according to the NACU Estatement Specification.

[~andreav],

Please set the QA due date for the pilot initial review.

comment: [~mamunur.rashid] - Please work on posting the job on InfoTRAC as well so that the job reflects on job status and Admin reports. Please let me know when done.


author: mamunur.rashid
comment: [~andreav],

I set up the Job Status feature for NACU on Infotrac. I already posted the file that Thomas provided on pilot (ms1_20220826_1_20220826_1155_nacu.txt). But there is no DT_JOB_ID associated with that file. I think that's why that job status is not being shown on Infotrac.




author: andreav
comment: [~thomasY] - Please see Mamun's comment and add DT_JOB_ID so that the statements can be displayed on InfoTRAC Job Status.


author: thomasy
comment: [~mamunur.rashid]I checked out database and there is a dtjobid already associated with the index file.

comment: [~thomasY] - Why is there a "1" showing on job status for paper when there is no paper?
 !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! 


author: thomasy
comment: [~andreav]We need to process at least 1 account under paper for infotrac to work correctly and for posting to work. The account is just a blank dummy account.


author: andreav
comment: [~mamunur.rashid] - On InfoTRAC, it seems like all the accounts are set to paper delivery preference. Did you run the test pre-enrollment file? Also, can you provide the external enrollment file for the most recent cycle? This should be automated to place on the FTP client pick up folder. The automation should be tested.


author: andreav
comment: [~mamunur.rashid] - Any update?


author: mamunur.rashid
comment: [~andreav],

Those accounts you noticed in Infotrac were created from the doc process. From the doc process delivery preference is always set to paper for a new account. When the user tied to those accounts will do SSO then their delivery preference will be changed to Electronic.

I tried to run the test pre-enrollment file but I saw some new business logic in that file.

!image-2022-09-12-16-37-22-506.png!

What does user_type *"B"* mean? As far as I know, we use user_type *P*for personal users and type *N* for business users.

Also, I noticed that account_type in that file is set as *DEP* and*LOAN*. We don't support this. We use account types containing two characters at most. As per the eStatement specification, NACU won't use account types. So this field should be empty.


author: diegof
comment: [~mamunur.rashid] there is no place on the specification doc that says "N" is for business users. In this case they put "B" for business users. Can we set up to ignore the account type?

I will request the changes if absolutely needed but the spec doc does not mention any of these issues presented.


author: mamunur.rashid
comment: [~diegof],

There is an enrollment file specifications doc attached to the NACU specification doc. In the enrollment file specifications doc you will find the following row about user type "P" or "N":

Pre-enrolled users will get email notifications after the statement is posted if we set up pre-enrollment in such a way that pre-enrolled users need to view the disclosure.

The email notification process doesn't check if users have gone through the enrollment steps or not.

comment: [~mamunur.rashid] We're turning off needApproval for posting. This is an optional feature and the client didn't sign up for it.

Some questions about Infotrac:
1. Insert was not showing on the pilot statement posting even though there was insert setup.
2. In Account Management, there's an "Action" drop down even though clicking on it doesn't do anything, was that part of some feature?

Thanks,
Sean


author: andreav
comment: [~mamunur.rashid] Also, I realized I did not turn on Banner Management on the pilot InfoTRAC, which per SOW, they should have complimentary for 6 months. So I have turned it on and I see the tab now. Do you need to set up anything on your end?

comment: [~diegof], [~andreav], [~meens],
 # Nothing happens for the failed items in pre-enrollment. That means account, fin-account, user profile, notification preference, delivery preference, etc. won't be set.
 # What should be the default date range if they don't want 3 years as the archival period?
 # I have updated the email and phone number information under the"Need help?" section.
 # "Important Information"? is customizable. Provide me the verbiage and I will change the verbiage.
 # I need to configure banner management on the Hypercube side also.


author: mamunur.rashid
comment: [~Tin.Chak],

There was a configuration issue for Insert. I changed the configuration. It is working fine now.

The"Action" drop-down is a bug. I informed the Infotrac team to solve it.

7) Upon enrollment, all accounts should be defaulted and locked to "agree to paperless". This was OK last week but somehow reverted this week. Please fix.

12) Can client send us a CIF to purge enrolled users so they don't have to unenroll one by one on InfoTRAC? If custom file needed, what info needs to be included?

13) Users who are unenrolled, then enrolled again should go through the enrollment steps again. Please confirm this set up.

18) Update statement calendar from 2019 to current date/year since there is no history.

20) Update contact phone number and email address under "Need Help?": 
info@navigantcu.org

21) When an account is ineligible for estatements it presents the message- *"This account does not have any electronic statements at this time."*  Is this text customizable if we pay for it?

3. I already talk with Diego about this. Those accounts were created from doc process. I changed the flag. From now this won't be happening.
7. I am still getting only "agree to paperless". Please check again.
12. Just send me those CIF numbers. We can run SQL queries to unenroll users. Currently, there is no process to unenroll users.
13. This is already on pilot.
18. We must set start_date at least one month before the current date. And it will show the statement for one month only.
19. Can you provide the screenshot where this important information should be placed?
20. It's already done.
21. Yes, It is customizable. I have updated the verbiage.
26. I tried to send a sample email and it worked for me.
28. I Informed Infotrac team.
30. It worked fine for me.

3) Please provide a new enrollment file so client can confirm it is resolved.
12) This request is for a permanent solution going forward to unenroll users. So based on your response, in the future for production, all the client has to do is send us a list of CIF numbers? Is there a file format and naming convention that should be used? Will the program automatically process it when it occurs?
19) See highlighted area in screenshot attached.

I attached new external enrollment report files.[^nacu_external_enrollment_report_files.zip]

It would be better if we wipe all the data that was created from pre-enrollment and doc process. As some flag has been changed so there might be some mismatch in the data. If we wipe data and insert again then the test will show actual data related to their final business.



I updated the important information verbiage.



I deleted those CIF so that they can re-enroll again.

Client reported most items were NOT fixed and failed retesting. See comments below:

Every item that is stated as resolved, with the exception of the important message, which still needs to be fixed as the first sentence is to be bolded is failing.
I also did not check the transfer stmt feature and I cannot check the date range and/or the CU email address since I cannot get any eStatements.

I wiped previous data and re-inserted it again. I think all the issue is resolved now.

I went through the notify-service codebase and saw there was domain whitelisting. I added *navigantcu.org* as whitelisted. I was able to send the sample email to the email:*elavergne@navigantcu.org*

After all the verbiage customization here is the current look and feel of estatement page while there is no statement available.

author: andreav
comment: See questions from client and advise ASAP.
3) 9/30 If you review the 9/12, 9/23 & 9/30 files, they have account numbers in the CIF field where it should only be SSN#.  Why are we seeing disparities in the enrollment file?

12) Still pending a response on this: To remove users from eStatements (change back to paper), can we send the CIF info only to be purged?  What custom report capabilities are there? 

13) 9/30- More clarification, this question ties with 12.  If a member closes all of there accounts, or requests to go back to paper (a) how can this be fulfilled.  Then when this is fulfilled, does that "mean" they are unenrolled?  If all accounts are set back to paper, does that constitute not being enrolled?

36) How does a Tax Form get linked ?  Does it matter if the Tax form is for a loan 1098 versus a deposit 1099?  Are they all visible ?



author: mamunur.rashid
comment: [~andreav], [~meens]

3) External enrollment file before 9/30 is not valid because there was some corrupted data due to business logic change. But the external enrollment file from 9/30 is valid. Could you provide me with the account number that is present under the CIF fields on 9/30's file? We don't include SSN in the external enrollment reports.

12) We don't have any automated process that unenroll users using index file that contains CIFs. A new feature is under developement in Infotrac to unenroll a user.

13) In current setup if a user changes delivery preference to paper for all accounts then the user will be automatically unenrolled (he needs to go through enrollment steps again to view eStatements).

36) All taxes are visible.


author: andreav
comment: [~mamunur.rashid] - See client's feedback/questions below and advise ASAP.
3) The client is sending us the Pre-enrollment file with the first field "CIF" containing the SSN. Therefore, the SSN is the value that should be populating in the external enrollment report. Please fix and once done, provide a new ext enrollment file from today, 10/4, since they have been testing Business Banking accounts and want to see the corresponding ext enrollment file. 

36) Please post tax forms so client can review. 

37) Client reported that when they enrolled as a business sub user for 2 accounts, the Admin user lost access to 9 out of 10 accounts. They are asking if we put back the profile settings tab, will the business admin user then be able to update the delivery preferences for the rest of the account for electronic delivery? They want the delivery type to be hard coded to electronic. If yes, then please make the update ASAP so they can test.

comment: [~mamunur.rashid] - Client Feedback today, please respond ASAP:
In BB testing- the OLB email overwrites the email address in infotrac when multiple users access the system. Company admin logs in and their NCR email address displays in infotrac then sub user logins, the sub user's email address overrides the email in  infotrac. Is this expected behavior?  It will mess up notifications.

37) Need more clarification. I went through the log but didn't find any BB log there. Can you provide me with the time when they enrolled with BB method? If a user lost access to any account then in the profile tab those accounts won't be shown.

Thank you for adding back the profile tab. Client tested it and listed below is their feedback.

We see the profile tab but when we are expanding the accounts listed there for enrollment, the radio button is not hardcoded for electronic. Can they make that the default like they did previously? 

Thanks


author: mamunur.rashid
comment: [~meens], [~andreav], [~diegof],

The default behavior of hypercube is as follows:
 * Suppose a user is already enrolled with 3 accounts. If additional 2 accounts are added for that enrolled user then on the next time log in those 2 accounts will be on paper by default.
 * NACU wanted to hide their paper preference. As 2 additional accounts are on paper but the paper preference is hidden so in profile page electronic preference was not selected for those accounts.

Currently what I have done is:
 * I have shown the paper preference again in the profile tab but it is disabled. So customers can't change preferences from electronic to paper but the newly added account can change delivery preference from paper to electronic.

46) In testing we ran into this situation so i am not sure if is becasue we are in a test enviroment. I think it has to do with no NCR email being passed. Post enrollment,, we added an account to the DNA agreement and it comes through in the SSO but when i look at it in my PROFILE, it has no email address attached. Can this happen when we go LIVE? Would we have to add the email address in infoTrac? How would we know that is was missing

comment: [~andreav],

About disabling email notifications for pre-ingestion there is a checkbox in PUI frontend called *suppress email*. If pre-ingestion is posted manually from PUI then checking this checkbox will disable email notification. If pre-ingestion is posted through script then we need to disable email notification from conf. Do you know how DP will post pre-ingestion?
