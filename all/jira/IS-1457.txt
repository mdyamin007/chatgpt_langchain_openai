Upon analysis ofEQBK_DDA_09302021.DAT, it appears that the transaction is not appearing on the statement because in our program, this particular transaction does not fit into the existing criteria of what should be added to the "Checks Paid Electronically" section.



The existing criteria is as follows (all must be met):

1) A Debit transaction with an associated check number

2) A section code (extracted from the data) of 'ARC', 'POP', 'POS', 'RCK', 'BOC' or 'PPD'

   OR an empty section code with a transaction description of 'ACH Payment'



The transaction in question -- CITIBANK MASTERC BILL PFY -- has an empty section code with a transaction description of 'Bill Pay Withdrawal'. Meanwhile, the transaction that is being displayed on the statement provided -- BLUE CROSS BLUE BILL PAY -- has a section code of 'PPD'. I have attached screenshots of these 2 transactions in the data file for your convenience.

Do you have samples ready for this project?  They were due 2 days ago.

Here is a small sample:  [^EQBKMS11.pdf] 

Note that the new logic is: 
If this type of transaction has a check number, it will be put in the "Checks Paid Electronically"
If they don't, they will be in "Other Debits"

Check with the client if the above logic will work for them. 

Thanks,
Anwar
