I ran the process using a small data. I put the account that has the scenario of this task in that data.

Look for account360120182 (1st customer in the sample) for the expected scenario. In production this customer statement has missing check images.

In the sample this customer has the expected check images.

Sample is at:/d/ac-secure-share/dsi_print/mahbubS/bkplms2105.sam.pdf

Thanks

[~Igor.Khosid]- BKPL went through a merger last EOM. Their new merger statements were printed without check images. This update is to correct that.Look for account 360120182 (1st customer in the sample PDF) for the expected scenario. In production this customer statement has missing check images.

The check image may be missing when you will test locally. However the check images are available in server /z/prep/bkpl/tiff/ directory.

So in print sample the check images would be there.

Thanks
