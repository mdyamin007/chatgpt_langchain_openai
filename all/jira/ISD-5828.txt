comment: [~phoebe.george] Just to confirm on the e-side, is this an additional application setup to post under their existing eCredit Card tab or is this a new app setup?

comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] Sorry i missed replying to your question in the previous comment! This is a "new" application, but will appear under the existing eCredit Card tab. It will be processed separate from the eCredit Card file though, under a different prefix.

IS created the following for posting to pilot - can you post when ready?

Thank you!

comment: Hi [~phoebe.george],

Gotcha, I've added the prefix ye1 to our configurations and tried posting, however I think the index file format is incorrect. It seems to still be following the old AFP format without the header on line 1, SUCU should be using the newer Doc processing. Can we have IS take a look? Thanks!

[~thomasY] Can you see ISD's comment above? I'll add to your story as well.
