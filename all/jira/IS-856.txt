[~thomasY], have these notices never had electronic set up before? The SOW states they are set up for print and electronic notices.


author: eric.yan
comment: [~thomasY]

I saw 014 is in the index file. Are you saying 031 has no enotice and the resource is for 031?

author: thomasy
comment: [~dyuen]Can you request to print from the sefcdlc130.is.afp file? Same dpvs is fine.

[~gthillaivel] I don't know what is causing those errors. The index format is the same as the previous one. Maybe it will be corrected if reprocessed. New index file:dlc_20220110_1_20220331_1326_sefc.txt

If it still has error, please ask [~eric.yan]to check.
