comment: [~mac] [~tai.trinh] EQBK attached the pre-enrollment file to ticket #22725, I've attached here to the Jira Story as well.

Upon preliminary review from my end, the file format/columns match the previous pre-enrollment file from the last EQBK merger.

Please review and confirm if okay to load to production today. Thank you!
