Please upload the attached index file[^ml4_04152021_1_20211214_1704_ewbb.txt] to pilot.

This index file was produced from parallel environment with the staging DT_JOB_ID rather than on pilot, but it should be good.

Thanks!

Thanks.

comment: [~Azad] I noted on a separate Jira ticket, but EWBB had previously approved the pilot site.

QA is in progress on the IS story. Please prepare your items in preparation for parallel testing, I'll be submitting this once QA is completed.

I will update each of the Jira ISD stories with this same update tied to this project. Thanks!

comment: [~Azad] EWBB has API, however I don't see the new mortgage statement type in the InfoConfig properties on all lower environments. Can you confirm?

Also I noticed that on both the admin site and sso stage, the Application is showing as 'Unknown' rather than 'Mortgage'. Can you take a look? For stage sso, I manually tied acct 9180734 to CIF 1709054 in order to validate, so you can use it as well. Attaching screenshots stage_unknown_sso.PNG and stage_unknown_admin.PNG

Sean was to confirm us about whether EWBB uses the InfoSERVICE-jaas or not. He confirmed us the previous day and I have configured mortgage on dev, pilot and stage.

And the account description is showing 'Unknown' instead of 'Mortgage' is because no AUTH process is run for those accounts.I've manually updated the "sub_type" value from null to "ML" in the FIN_ACCOUNT table for the account 9180734 and got the 'Mortgage' description on both admin and sso stage. Attaching screenshots stage_mortgage_sso.png and stage_mortgage_admin.png

Thanks!

comment: Thanks [~Azad], I can see the Mortgage description as well. 

Regarding the API, were you able to verify on stage? On the swagger page, I tested using document V1 on pilot and was able to see mortgage populated from the test URL, however I just see 'no content' when I do the same thing on stage. I used this acct on both pilot and stage: 9180734

comment: Hi [~Shun.Kuwashima]

I couldn't verify the InfoSERVICE-jaas instance as currently I don't have the username and password which is required to make the api call. The configuration is same as InfoSERVICE. I've tried infoservice-common-stage swagger page and get 'no content' for the account9180734. But if I try the test url generated from the swagger page ([infoservice-common-stage-documentv1|http://ca-infotrac-st-01.infoimageinc.com:8580/infoservice/api/v1/document/ewbb/search/all?acctNum=9180734&acctType=05&includeClosed=true&searchCriteria=%255B%257B%2522key%2522%3A%2522startDate%2522%2C%2522operator%2522%3A%2522%3D%2522%2C%2522operand%2522%3A%25222021-01-10%2522%257D%2C%257B%2522key%2522%3A%2522endDate%2522%2C%2522operator%2522%3A%2522%3D%2522%2C%2522operand%2522%3A%25222022-02-10%2522%257D%255D&vendor=infoimage]) in the browser, I am getting response.

I think no-content issue is related to swagger, the setup is okay. Nevertheless I will make sure.

Thanks!

I tried search/all api on the InfoSERVICE-jaas ([api-pui-stage-documentV2|http://ca-apipui-st-01.infoimageinc.com:8480/infoservice/api/v2/document/ewbb/search/all?acctNums=blYTOIdc5tSkmKSSCJGzaQ&acctTypes=05&searchCriteria=[\{%22key%22:%22startDate%22,%22operator%22:%22=%22,%22operand%22:%222021-01-10%22},\{%22key%22:%22endDate%22,%22operator%22:%22=%22,%22operand%22:%222022-02-10%22}]&includeInserts=Y&includeClosed=true&vendorId=infoimage]) stage instance today for the account 9180734 provided the username and password.

I got the response with one statement of type mortgage. I am attaching the screenshot here. For any issue, please let me know.

For 'no-content' issue on swagger, if it is a GET api, try posting the api-url in the browser to be sure a response is served.

Thanks. !Screenshot from 2022-03-22 19-39-19.png!

comment: To QA,

Process _*ml4_20210415_1_20211220_1023_ewbb.txt*_ to test Escrow Analysis. ml4 will be processed via Document processing.

Index file and zip file are already on place. Run the job with 'Parallel Run' checked to process on test mode.

For testing purpose, doc process will create account if new.

Thanks!

Index file failed to process, processing ref# 192420

comment: Hi [~nprimak]

The job failed becausedt_job_id is missing from dataTrac(IS) database. Please run the job with "By Pass Dt_jobId search" flag checked.

Thanks!

comment: [~Azad] [~Igor.Khosid] [~phoebe.george] 

I processed by passing dt_job_id successfully.

I still have questions:
 * I found only 2 accounts from processed file with same processing date April 15. 2021 as on pilot IS-599 and same header on a statement, but on pilot each account has multiple pages, on staging very short, no info (compare pilot acc# 9193050, staging acc# 9175422)
 * Should I SSO page, it is in attachment in a story

Thank you,

Natasha

 # Those are two different loan statements as the loan number is different on each document. You can ignore the statement contents as there is a higher chance that the files are not authentic. In production this should not happen as the files will be authentic.
 # You can SSO into EWBB. For that you have to run an Auth process with the cif you want to SSO.

Thanks

Verified Escrow Account disclosure statement on staging Admin site.

SSO is working but I did not verify statements on SSO site, accounts from processed index file don't have cif number in DB.

Usually we verify statements only on Admin site, releasing story based on qa tests and comments above

Thank you,

Natasha
