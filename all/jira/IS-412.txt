The test files are missing the date and OD limit fields. Can you please ask customer to fix and send new test files?

The new test file is missing the date field. Does customer want to add the date field to the test file or can I use the system date?


author: barnetts
comment: [~jun],

For the missing date field, HCCU wants us to use the system date so the date stays current. Can you please advise if this is possible?


author: jun
comment: [~barnetts],

Yes, that's fine.

comment: Hi [~jun],

The samples are approved by HCCU. Also the envelope type is 4000 ( I updated the description). 

Quick question, I didn't see an endorsement on the samples. Can you please add it if needed?
* Can you please provide a DPVS so I can request print samples.
* Can you also please provide [~Igor.Khosid], source file and insert file?

Thanks, Barnett

Attached source file + insert file.



Attached DPVS. For the envelope, do you mean 4001? I see 4001 for envelope and 4000 for paper which is what I've currently configured.

I am not sure if this requires endorsement. I dont think I can decide on that. Please let me know which endorsement I should add.

I can't see the attached DPVS for some reason. 
For the envelope, yes I meant the 4001. Thank you for confirming the  4001 for envelope and 4000 for paper. 
For the endorsement, can you please use "Return Service Requested"?

Thanks, Barnett
