Note: Test electronic only as this error came from electronic as seen on TS#32838 (#1), so please make sure that the same error doesn't appear.As noted in the QA checklist, please also check the dfa to see the update in the condition with'RECOV.INI.SHARE' that extracts the address to be updated from 'input_rec' to 'var[1]' and check that the account (#350 on papyrus) is displaying a letter like the 'after letter update screenshot' attached on Jira.

changed to
_CASE POS('RECOV.INI.LOAN',UPPER(VAR[1]),1)<>0 OR POS('RECOV.INI.SHARE',UPPER(VAR[1]),1)<>0 ; - check;
 # The notice from the screenshot looking OK in Papyrus - check;
 # The notice and the likes of it looking good in InfoTRAC - check.

Good to go.
