comment: DSI Team,

The new verbiage will replace the ones in the red box. Please send the screenshot of the change on pilot by 7/28, and send it to the QA at the same time. We want this to go live by 8/4. Thanks.

The new verbiage is updated on Pilot and Stage (9.0.0.4). See attached screenshot (sefc_new_banner_verbiage_updated.png).

Also, the new verbiage contains a link titled "Merger Notice". The link currently showing page not found. Let me know if that's okay. I am attaching the screenshot (sefc_verbiage_link_response.png)

I am handing it over to QA.

Thanks!

comment: Thank you [~Azad] [~Tin.Chak]. Yes, it's OK that the link in the verbiage is showing page not found. That will be a live link after 8/1.

Thanks!

comment: [~Azad] [~Tin.Chak], SEFC is still seeing the old verbiage on the pilot site. Please advise.

comment: Hi [~dyuen]

I am seeing the updated verbiage on Pilot. I am guessing it might be a local caching issue. Can you advice them to clear their cache and try again? Here is the screenshot from my computer.

comment: Hi [~Azad], could be. I asked SEFC to clear their cache and try again.

Thanks

comment: [~Tin.Chak] [~Azad] FYI
An incorrect token leads to an error opening the client's SSO site on Stage - BT-108


author: dyuen
comment: [~Azad], this is approved! Please proceed with final QA and testing. Please confirm if the disclosures will be updated by 8/4.

"That worked! Thanks so much. Everything looks good. SEFCU approves the update."

[~Shun.Kuwashima], we're working on the logo update. Will there be any issues with code release?

Thanks!

comment: [~dyuen] there shouldn't be any code release issues, since we would probably need to release the logo (ISD-7428) at a later date depending on when we can pass client approval.


author: dyuen
comment: [~Azad] [~Andrey.Kutsenko], please advise on the status of this. As mentioned/added to the Jira description the link to the merger notice will not be live until 8/1 for SEFC.

Thanks
