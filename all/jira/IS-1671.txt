Hi[~dyuen]: I updated time line is Epic, when client request for this month end. But IS story was not updated. That's why, [~Natalie.Tom]missed the timeline. I just spoke to Thomas. He will review and let us know the closest sample date tomorrow. Please follow up with Thomas tomorrow.

comment: [~dyuen]Do we have any approval update? Live date is today.


author: dyuen
comment: [~thomasY], not yet. I followed up on the ticket. I also updated the live date on the Jira.


author: dyuen
comment: [~thomasY], looks like we'll be getting a new test file. Response from SEFC:

"Hey Daphne, I actually spotted something that I believe was an issue with the DNA setup of these products so I made some changes and requested Fiserv run another statement extract for us to test. I don't believe it was anything on the mapping side but want to confirm. This is related to the minor type name on the statements, I think they are coming over with a nickname/alternate description that is incorrect.

Hoping to have a new extract this week."



I updated the due date again.


author: dyuen
comment: [~thomasY], attached is an updated test file. For the purposes of testing, can you rename the file? In production, it should be exactly the same.
