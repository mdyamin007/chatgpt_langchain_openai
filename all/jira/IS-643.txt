title: WFCU:  Daily Notices:  PDF Archival Add Cleanup Logic (In-house)
description: Parallel Required: Yes (Run Paper, eStmt & PDF) to make sure all service perform without issues.



Please review the "/home/master/wfcu_process.sh" shell script. There is a bug where the program does not clear the/d/pdf_afp/wfcu/wfcudla/backup/ folder+before+ beginning the PDF archival program. Files are constantly being accumulated.



I think somewhere below in the snippet of code is where you need to insert logic to clear the backup folder before beginning the PDF archival process


{{######################################################}}
{{######### afp to pdf file conversion ################}}{{# Remove the old files}}
{{echo "afp to pdf file conversion"}}
{{pdfDir="${d_dir}/pdf_afp/${cid}/wfcudla"}}{{if ! [ $pdfDir -o $pdfDir/backup ]}}
{{then}}
{{ mkdir -p $pdfDir/backup}}
{{fi}}{{echo "find ${pdfDir}/ -maxdepth 1 -iname "*.*" | xargs -i% rm %"}}
{{find ${pdfDir}/ -maxdepth 1 -iname "*.*" | xargs -i% rm % 2>$daily_log 1>&2}}

comment: [~amirR]: Can you also include the program transfer form as well? I will just do code review and if logic is ok, we will release it without parallel.
