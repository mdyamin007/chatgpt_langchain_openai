Yes, I'll provide a sample by end of this week.

comment: [~eric.yan] Please confirm this is on schedule for 10/12 live date.

It needs to be in place for this upcoming EOM cycle for tracking the notifications for October reporting. Thanks!

Sorry about the delay. A sample has been generated for the last cycle monthly statement and placed in the client pickup folder for review.

I've enabled to report and it should start running on 10/12 2AM and repeat every month on the 12th.

I only [addeddp@sfcu.org|mailto:added%C2%A0dp@sfcu.org]to the report notification since I'm not sure if multiple email address is supported. I'll follow up on this.
