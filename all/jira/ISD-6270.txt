I wanted to see if we are on track for samples tomorrow.

It is done on Pilot.

It is not something a client can visually inspect.  Currently, E-Notices older than four months are gone.  The client can only check and see whether we maintain E-Notices as old as 13 months going forward.

Thanks.

Since GECU is not able to visually inspect the update. Could we reprocess a older file and update it to pilot? 

Thanks, Barnett

I back dated one of the E-Notices.  The client can view an E-Notice dated 01/15/2021 on account 70903521.

This is ready for QA.  I have backdated an E-Notice of account '71124421' to 13 months in the past.  The account '71124421' belongs to user '35'.

Please complete this by Wed 02/02.

Testing on SSO Page:
- Change user_fi_number to '35' on SSO page to see this account.
- Ensure you have this line in hosts file: 10.5.16.191 gecustage.infoimageinc.com

Testing on MSM Page:
- Search for account '71124421'

Thanks.
Lin
