title: ssoKeyGen - Invalid Token
description: Page Not Found - when we try open SSO Member site on Stage:
 "You're trying to access a page that is not available or you supplied an Invalid Token.

Most likely this is due to an incorrect password value when generating a token.

The password is configured okay.



SEFC has bottomline and singlesignon7 as sso methods. I am referencing bottomline sso here (_bbSSO Hypercube_ on sso test page for SEFC).

For bottomline sso you have to pass a *comp_user_number* and one or more account number and account type pair.The account number and type can be found from FIN_ACCOUNT table.

Finding the comp_user_number(cif_num) is a bit tricky. SEFC has a business called external ID mapping. This business uses two types of cif numbers - external and internal. The cif_num stored on the usr_mapping table are treated as the *internal* cif numbers. While doing sso for SEFC, you have to provide the mapped*external* cif number for that internal cif number.

The external-internal cif number mapping is found on the*EXT_ID_MAPPING* table, column named*external_id*.





Here are two queries that will help you to find data to do sso on SEFC.


{code:java}
select fa.ACCT_NUMBER, fa.TYPE, ufa.USR_ID
from USR_FIN_ACCOUNT ufa, FIN_ACCOUNT fa
where fa.ORG_ID = GETORGID('sefc')
and fa.ACCT_ID = ufa.ACCT_ID
and ufa.USR_ID in (
  select um.USR_ID from USR_MAPPING um where um.ORG_ID = GETORGID('sefc') and CIF_NUM in (
    select INTERNAL_ID from EXT_ID_MAPPING ext
    where ext.ORG_ID = GETORGID('sefc')
    and EXTERNAL_ID_TYPE = 'cif'
    and INTERNAL_ID_TYPE = 'cif'
  )
);{code}
From this query result, get any acct_number and type pair. For this example, I am taking1697669324/NA.



Also, get the usr_id from this row i.e.26883081. Use this usr_id in the following query and get the external_id to use as the comp_user_number.


{code:java}
select ext.EXTERNAL_ID
from USR_MAPPING um, EXT_ID_MAPPING ext
where um.ORG_ID = GETORGID('sefc')
and um.ORG_ID = ext.ORG_ID
and um.CIF_NUM = ext.INTERNAL_ID
and um.USR_ID = '26883081';
{code}
Use the comp_user_number and the account number/type pair on the sso test page.

sso test page: [http://client-test.infoimageinc.com/sso/]

I am attaching a screenshot of the sso test page with these data here (see attachment: sefc_sso_test_page_bb.png)



Hope these all make sense.

comment: Thank you [~Azad]
However, for the search "comp_user_number", I use another query:
{code:sql}
select um.cif_num, fa.* from fin_account fa
inner join usr_fin_account ufa on ufa.acct_id = fa.acct_id
inner join usr_mapping um on um.usr_id = ufa.usr_id
where fa.org_id = getorgid('sefc') and fa.acct_number in ('1697669324');
{code}
[~Tin.Chak] FYI
