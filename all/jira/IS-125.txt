Still no response from the client. Phoebe has a call with FCBT Tomorrow and will bring this to their attention. I have pushed the due date to EOM.

comment: Hi [~nischala.manjunath], client finally got back to me. The client advised that they may want to move the "Void after 180 days to another location on the check, can you advise if that's possible? if so can you add it anywhere?


author: nischala.manjunath
comment: Hi [~MattL], I can move it to the right, either under the address in the center (Columbus, OH) or under the check number. Would that work?

comment: Still waiting for an answer


author: mattl
comment: Hi [~nischala.manjunath]! Client asked if we could move it "closer to the center."
