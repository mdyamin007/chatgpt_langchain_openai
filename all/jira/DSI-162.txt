I have some queries from the SOW file.
 # section *1.0.5, 3.0.(a).3.c,**3.0.(a).3.d & 6.0.5* seems contradictory to each other, I need clarification on that.
 # will Quarterly Statements be another statement type?
 # which SSO method they will be using?
 # I have seen in SOW Etax & Enotice will have separate SOW, can you provide more details on this.
 # They have *pre-ingestionservices,*will it be assigned to print team or to us?

Thanks

comment: Hi all,

Please see updates below in red to these questions:
 # section *1.0.5, 3.0.(a).3.c,**3.0.(a).3.d & 6.0.5* seems contradictory to each other, I need clarification on that. [PHOEBE]: Please enable selective paperless management. We will not display the selective paperless options through the enrollment steps, only the Profile area and InfoTrac access.
 # will Quarterly Statements be another statement type? {color:#FF0000}[PHOEBE] No, monthly and quarterly will be considered the same application. The quarterly file is just a bigger file, but all else will be the same.{color}
 # which SSO method they will be using? [PHOEBE] {color:#FF0000}Their online banking vendor is Fiserv Architect, and will mirror APCU and GCBK setups for SSO.{color}
 # I have seen in SOW Etax & Enotice will have separate SOW, can you provide more details on this. {color:#FF0000}[PHOEBE] I will be sending an updated version for eNotice and eTax SOW. But we need to include these tabs for setup, but eTax and eNotices have more specifications that need to be documented since they have multiple notices/tax forms per application.{color} 
 # They have *pre-ingestionservices,*will it be assigned to print team or to us? {color:#FF0000}[PHOEBE] This is still to be determined, as we are waiting for test files from WECU in order to determine if they can meet our file requirements.{color}

 # I have seen they have two types of users: *commercial*& *retail*. Do they have any special business based on the user type? what will be their *primary user flag* values?
 # Do they have account types?

Thanks

 ## {color:#FF0000}business - N{color}
{color:#FF0000}primary - P or null{color}
{color:#FF0000}secondary - S{color}
 # Do they have account types?
 ## {color:#FF0000}Per the client, they do not want to have any account # overlapping between DDA, savings etc, so no account types are needed.{color}

I have committed the code in trunk and deployed in the pilot.
I also linked the wiki page as a release note.
thanks

I have attached the logo, sample PDF, and primary and secondary colors for WECU. See attachments

As for the eTax and eNotice SOW, we are still getting that.

Can you get the logo, sample PDF, and colors for WECU for their site up by tomorrow?

I have changed the code for WECU, deployed the code in the pilot.
also, you can find the changelog for this release in the release note linked in the ticket.

comment: Hi Abdullah,

I have also attached theWECU_eStatement Disclosure.docx which contains the verbiage for disclosure. Can you update that and deploy on hypercube pilot.

here is the update for WECU
 # After going through the infoservice log I have found out that, while setting up the pilot in infotrac, *AUDIT_LOG_WECU*table wasn't created in the pilot_cu schema. That's why infotrac was showing internal server error as the infoservice API throw exception while inserting into *AUDIT_LOG_WECU*table. I have created the table and tested user and account creation, it works fine now.
 # I haven't changed the ORG_ID as you suggested, infoservice inserts the corrent org_id(the one of CU schema) while creating user and account, infoTrac code base should do the same( inserts don't use infoservice). So Mehedi is looking into it as this can affect other clients as well. so I wil llet you know if I get any update from him.
 # I have tested with 000123456-00,000123456-16 accounts for batchdowlaod.

Thanks

I have some confusion regarding WECU:
 # They want to show only one delivery preference per account but they also want selective paperless configuration so i need some feedback on that, which one should I provide for hypercube? that should be the same in infotrac as well.
 # They also want a horizontal line to separate the footer from the main content, are we going to support that?
 # They want the radio button text of *notify me by* in *profile*pageverbiage to say "*TEXT*" instead of "*SMS*" , but it is not configurable in hypercube now. are we going to support that? cause it will be a global change. attached is the screenshot.
 # Does the vendor pass the phone number? There is a question about phone number not being auto-populated, I need clarification for that.
 # They asked to link the reconciliation, but It already in the statement page but since we didn't get actual reconciliation it shows a dummy pdf for now. is this what the client asked? or they want it a menu like disclosure? also, Do we have the actual reconciliation yet?

I only have the answer to number 1. As of now we can keep it as is for the UI for SSO. For infoTRAC it will need to be selective.

I will get back to you on the other questions.

Also, can you commit the code to trunk and build from the changes in green from your email on 2/5.

I have some quires based on SOW:
 # Based on the SOW the archival period for the enotices will be 4months, am I right?
 # Will enotice use Document process or Enotice4?
 # I need enotice index file formate, There is nothing on the SOW about file formate. so I need sample index file to start on processing UI.

Thanks

hi [~Bryant.Tran],

currently, we do not have support for SMS notification type for *noLinkType byUsr.* **We need to develop and test as well so we will need time for that.

for paperless config *byUsr*means they don't have selective paperless as in every account has only one paperless entry and that one is for type default, we always show *all the accounts* linked to a user on the profile page regardless of selective or non-selective paperless.

thanks.
