title: 30131 - IVBK - Ivy bank statements not available thru online banking
description: HTML IVBK statements weren't showing up.



Due to the input server partition updates, we had to restart the wrapper service servers and restart the afp2web docker containers. This resolved the issues, due to html statements being temporarily stored in the input server folder rather than data passed over to the afp2web server directly.
