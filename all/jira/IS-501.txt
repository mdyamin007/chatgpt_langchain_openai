comment: [~eric.yan] Per VWCU we are going to run these in all black and white. Please confirm sample date and if you can use the logo I sent you (or pull it from another app).

Thanks!

The sample is ready for review.

I use the correct logo and updated the sample.

comment: [~kericapote]

Hi Keri,

I've found the logo with +4 digit zip code, here is the updated sample.

The summary/validation file naming convention is not determined in the SOW yet, could you have the client to confirm the name?


author: kericapote
comment: [~eric.yan] per VWCU

us know if anything more is needed on our end! thank you for the quick 
turnaround.

Please request sample for QA.

print file vwcuea11044.2o1.afp

paper 4000



1) I'm still working on validation logic.

2) The test data file has no invalid address, so invalid address report is not generated.

Eric, please move the project into the QA folder.

I am unable to start testing without:
 # The project is not in the QA folder
 # The mapping is not available
 # Index file - not provided

comment: [~Igor.Khosid] [~shailendrar] [~kericapote] 

For item #3, this setup is for print only, no index file/electronic for posting.

(No PDF archival as well).

Shail, can you provide the mapping link ASAP?



Thanks!
Phoebe

comment: [~kericapote]: Per my understanding with [~eric.yan]it is in parallel. You were going to check on the results. PLease advise ASAP once it passes. We need to schedule code release today with [~TunA]once we've confirmed it passes.

comment: code is released to production.

comment: [~eric.yan] VWCU is looking for the Invalid Address Report. Can you please confirm it posted and emailed them at realestateservicing@vantagewest.org? Also can you re-post or send it to me as they did not pick it up.



Thanks!

The last cycle doesn't have invalid address report since all account are mailed. You could see the details in the dpvs, there's no count for non-mail.
