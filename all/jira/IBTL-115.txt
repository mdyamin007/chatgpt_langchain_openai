comment: [~William.Kong] - olp_handler.sh has following logic for InfoSync URL which needs to be updated:



set_online_proofing_base_url(){

# online_proofing_url="http://is-apps-dev.infoimage.com/infosync/v1"

if [ "${HOSTNAME}" = "rht" -o "${HOSTNAME}" = "rht.infoimage" -o "${database}" = "test" ]
 then
 online_proofing_url="http://is-apps-dev.infoimage.com/infosync/v1"

elif [ "${testmode}" = "y" -a "${HOSTNAME}" != "rht" ]
 then
 online_proofing_url="http://is-apps-stage.infoimage.com/infosync/v1"
 else
 online_proofing_url="http://is-apps-prod.infoimage.com/infosync/v1"
 fi

echo "new online proofing url is $online_proofing_url"

}

comment: [~William.Kong] - This IndexFileProcessor service was down/not available hence the job did not get submitted.

comment: [~ernestw]: Thanks for the assistance! The bb-rhs2:/d/ncoa_dirs was not pointing to ca-rhstore-pr-01:/d/ncoa_dirs/. So the last few reported issues a few weeks ago was related to it.



[~jasramos]: Please re-test.
