title: Hypercube - Add configuration to Display Only Account Nicknames
description: Reassign Due Date accordingly.

Requirement:
 # Add a configuration
 # When this configuration is turned on, we will only display Account Nicknames if it is available, so instead of [Account Number - Nickname], it will just be [Nickname].
 # However, if the nickname is not available, we will display [Account Number] like normal. The number will be masked if the masking configuration is turned on.

I need some clarification
 # Where this nickname will be displayed? on the account selector or Profile page or on both places?
 # Which field in the DB will be treated as nickname? API already sends *acctName*, will this be used or *nickname*will be passed from API
 # Do we have any specific client for which this is requested?

Thanks,

Abdullah

This is the same as the account description.
 # So it should be displayed during Enrollment, in Account Selector, and in Profile Page. Usually, we have [Account] - [Description], the change is to display only[Description], or [Account] if description is not available.
 # This is the usr_acct_type_mapping table used for Descriptions.
 # FCBT is asking for this.

Thanks,
 Tai
