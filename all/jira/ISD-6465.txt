comment: Vendor:
"We analyzed both types of spool ("estatement" and "mortgage") and found the reason that impacts the performance. The S1IDCULB Page Segment included in the "mortgage" spool contains a page-sized image defined using IOCA FS 45. Processing an IOCA FS 45 image requires significantly more time and memory than other formats. In addition, the image planes are compressed using the IBM MMR compression. PDF does not support IBM MMR compression, so the planes must be decompressed, which adds time to the transformation. And since this image is not used in the "estatement" spool, this spool is transformed faster."

Resolution:
Replaced existing S1IDCULB.300 resource.
