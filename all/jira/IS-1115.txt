comment: Thank you [~berezinez]. Sample forwarded to MFCU for review/approval.

comment: Hi [~dyuen]

we need to know in which naming convention the client will send the tiff image
otherwise, we can't work on our scripting, and we will not be able to pick the image to display. Is it already confirmed?



[~berezinez]

Thanks


author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~rony], I've reached out to MFCU about the naming convention. I also wanted to note that the contact for this project is OOO this week, so we may not get an approval by today.


author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~rony], MFCU can call the TIFF file anything we want. When they originally sent the file it was titled"Annual Billing Rights Notice 03 2022.tiff". Will that work or do you have another preference?

Another question that came up is,should the .tiff image be included in our March credit card statement file or do you need it before?

Thanks


author: rony
comment: Hi [~dyuen]

Would you please ask the client if they can use this name for tifmfcu_annual_billing.tif?

For the next question:

_Another question that came up is,should the .tiff image be included in our March credit card statement file or do you need it before?_

Actually it doesn't matter to us. If tiff is provided inside the cycle meaning zip.pgp file we will display it otherwise not.

Thanks

comment: Thanks [~rony], I forwarded your response to MFCU. Still pending approval of sample.


author: dyuen
comment: Due date updated.

Note: This is still on MFCU's radar.


author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~rony], please see the following from MFCU:

"Sorry getting back to you late on this. For the file name can we domfcu_annual_billing_rights.tif instead. It's just that is how we call the disclosure. I also want to make sure it is a .tif and not a .tiff. Please confirm.

I like that plan of including this in the credit card statement zip. if it is present then that means you guys will include it as an in-line insert. If it's not there then you wont."

Please confirm.

Thanks


author: rony
comment: Hi [~dyuen]

Yes client's statement if ok. Would it be possible to provide a test cycle for us to process and test?

Thanks


author: rony
comment: Hi [~dyuen]

Any feedback on the test cycle with tiff inside it?



Thanks


author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~rony], not yet. I have followed up every week on my call with MFCU. They should have something by next week, hopefully.

Thanks


author: rony
comment: Hi [~dyuen]

No feedback for a long time. Can we change the status to hold?



Thanks
