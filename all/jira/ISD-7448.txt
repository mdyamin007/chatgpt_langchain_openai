The screenshot of previous implementation is below:

And the screenshot of current implementation is below:

We see eNewsletter link on the statement having closing date on quarter end in previous implementation. But in current implementation, statement does not have this link even if it's closing date is on quarter end.

For testing on pilot, you can do sso with these account numbers:0000334183, 0000421877, 0000462440, 0000517463, 0000530569       



Thanks

Code is currently on stage.

To QA,

The purpose of this task is to not show quarterly eNewsletter insert link from *Insert*column of statement table both in client/root site and admin/msm site. An example of implementation is given in above comment.

For testing on stage, you can do sso with these account numbers:0000334183, 0000421877, 0000462440, 0000517463, 0000530569 in root site.

Also test the msm site by searching with given account numbers.

In previous implementation, only those statements had eNewsletter insert link which had closing date on quarter end ("12-31"/ "03-31"/ "06-30"/ "09-30").
