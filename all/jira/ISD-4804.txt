title: SSCU Migration Analysis
description: *Concerns about ROOT*
 # Welcome email feature exists but the code to send welcome email is blocked (commented-out). Are the client still billed for welcome email?
 # Going paper does not log out the user. Instead shows an "opt-out" page in the statement tab. This page contains the disclosure verbiage and two input fields for email and email confirmation. But, Hypercube always unenroll user, if go to paper.
 # InfoSERVICE API is called after updating delivery preference.
 # This client is shifted from CONTACT_INFO to NOTIFICATION_PREFERENCE table. But migration is only done in Production database.

*Concerns about MSM*
 # It is not possible to create a new account with leading zero(s). It trims the leading zero(s) and saves in the FIN_ACCOUNT table. But in the USR_SESSION table, it saves sess_login_id with leading zero(s). Also, from the ROOT site, account creating with leading zero is possible.
 # In Email Proofing, user can upload email content from a file. This feature is not in InfoTRAC.
