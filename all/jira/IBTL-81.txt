title: DataTRAC:  DP Scanner IP Address Update
description: We will be performing production testing on 9/28/2020. During this process, we will be testing the DP scanning function (i.e. scanning DPVS and DataTRAC) to bridge the DT_JOB_ID with proc_id.



Terrence mentioned that the DataTRAC Visual Basic scanner program to point to the correct IP address in Brisbane. Would you be able to login and get this updated?



Here is some reference info:



*MSGP (Microsoft SQL Server):*

Today, Menlos IP address is 10.8.8.28. The new database server will be ca-msgp-pr-01.

**



*+IS RHT Server:+*

Today in Menlo, the scanner services are located in our RHT server with the IP address of: 10.8.9.71

The new RHT server will be using ca-isis-dv-01

comment: [~Terrence.Tong]: Per my email earlier. Although Mimi will be executing this task, i'm assigning this ticket to you so that I do not lose sight of it. Mimi doesn't use Jira so I cannot assign this task to her.

comment: [~Terrence.Tong]: He has not completed this task yet. He needs to work with Rogelio on this task;  Also there is another issue MSSQL API is deprecated. Terrence is looking for another solution on this. He might look into using an ODBC driver instead. He is spending time to research on how to do this.
