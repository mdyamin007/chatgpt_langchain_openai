Client is out of the office until Friday, we will most likely not receive approval until after then.

Please see response from client below.

The update for this notice was to add the Joint Name to the address block and salutation line.  That is not reflected in the samples (see example below)

[~jharvey] ---I checked the TS ticket and I there is no details for the update to add joint name. There was another ticket for the joint name update, which was tested by other QA

[~rony]--Can you update the Client requested changes and provide new sample for testing

Just spoke to client on phone and he would like us to coordinate releasing the code for this ticket and ticket 33099 at the same time on 10/26.

comment: Hi [~jharvey]



The 'Joint Name' is displayed in the address block and the client approved that sample.

Also, I provided the updated project in the QA folder and rechecked it.

Should we need to add theJoint Name to other positions too?



[~gthillaivel]

Thanks.

In the samples that we provided the client, only the primary member name is in the salutation line.  The samples provided are good.
