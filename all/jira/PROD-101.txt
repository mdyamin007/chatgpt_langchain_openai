title: InfoTRAC - Delete User
description: Update InfoTRAC's Account Center to have the capability to delete the user beside just disabling them.
The user's profile should still reside in the database for auditing but should not show up in the Account Center and also allow login ID to be reuse.

comment: Customers are not able to recreate user with same user name again. We are planning to modify delete logic.
