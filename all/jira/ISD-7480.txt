title: 30970 - RWCU Visa Email Notifications using Annual Visa Template instead

The emails for this job was for Visa, but the emails used the Annual Visa Statement template. It pulled the wrong template.

comment: # The template-service pulled two templates because it searched with 'Visa Statements'. Visa's desc = 'Visa Statements' and Annual Visa's desc = 'Annual Visa Statements', so I think the search query takes anything that contains 'Visa Statements'
 # On the PUI side, we always take the first template from the list of result of templates.
