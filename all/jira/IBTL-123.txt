comment: [~William.Kong] Overall the reprocessing looks to have run fine and it did process to completion (numbers seem to be matching as well); however, the following errors did get sent to log file:

[~shailendrar] & [~anil.dasa]: Is the {color:#de350b}*staging/parallel*{color} indexfileprocess not available or down? Please advise.


author: anil.dasa
comment: [~William.Kong]

Stage environment is not ready for infotrac and indexFileProcess. We are waiting for port access to run application.


author: anil.dasa
comment: [~davidt]

Do you have any ticket for network team to give port access to stage? We have created a smart sheet for port access.

Please re-test this in*parallel.* Once completed please update Parallel smartsheet:

comment: [~William.Kong] I have reprocessed this job, everything ran fine and I did not see any errors appearing in the log. I went ahead and passed this in the parallel smartsheet.


author: william.kong
comment: [~glenn.grimes]: Thanks for the update! I'm closing the ticket out now.
