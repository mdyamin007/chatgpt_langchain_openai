Will only add insert to major code CK for paper. Client will use estmt tool to add insert for all estmt accounts.



[~MattL]: Attached DPVS for laser simple. Please have laser confirm that insert is pulling from bin 1. For this cycle all 4.2o1 file has insert as they are all CK (including MM accounts)
