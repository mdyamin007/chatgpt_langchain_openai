212 --- acct#150016836901 (it's mail only and is suppress for e-notice. You can test with this account number)

205 and 214 are also suppressed for e-notice but they are not in any of the recent data files. I tested 214 for suppression in one of the old files.

213 is not in this data file.

Thanks!

The description does not match for the acct # you provided. Description is shown for 210 ,the acct # you gave for 212  acct#150016836901

comment: [~gthillaivel] - This account number is in letter 204 and 212. 212 is suppressed for enotice. That's why you see only 204.

comment: [~rukmaniR]--Do you have all the samples to compare ,that the correct notices are loading when user clicks on the PDF


author: JIRAUSER11100
comment: [~gthillaivel] - I don't have samples. You can either request from Steve or compare it with the corresponding dfa.

author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: Hi [~gthillaivel]- Please see attached. This project is just setting up the electronic versions of the letters already in production. I grabbed these samples from the last production file on InfoTrac. I wasn't able to get ALL the letters as they are not all sent every day. If you need to see others, please let me and [~rukmaniR]know. I'll need to work with her to get samples.

author: gthillaivel
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]-It's better to verify all the samples ,before I pass this ticket.In case if you can't provide the missing samples,I will pass with notes


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~gthillaivel]- In the interest of time, please pass with notes as I can't provide missing samples.


author: JIRAUSER11100
comment: [~gthillaivel] [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] - I have attached the rest of the samples which is generated from papyrus. It's old file but for comparison it should be okay. Customer is not sending letters 205 and 214.
