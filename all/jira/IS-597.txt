comment: [~phoebe.george]: The ticket live date is set for 12/31. What should be the correct revised live date for this project so that we can plan the release after ISD addresses their issues. Please allow us 5 days to prep.

comment: [~phoebe.george]: This ticket date is still past due. We cannot have a floating date as this month is very tied up. We need at least two weeks advance notice.

Verified statement on accounts from provided Index file, mortgage statements are opening and look good on Admin site.

Note:

I tried 12 accounts and only 5 were opening and showing statement, 7 others had error 'There was an error getting the requested file'

Let me know if it is not an issue and i can sign off the story.

I also don't see example of the mortgage pdf statement in a story, do i need to verify if I see correct statement?

Phoebe, I think issues/questions I listed above most likely can be ignored, please confirm and I will sign off the story

If you verified the estatement posting in pilot were correct then it should be fine.

FYI, we received some more test data files for this application. I have tried to process these data files and posted for estatement to review but these test files had data file issues.
