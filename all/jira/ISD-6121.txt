Hi Daphne, a sample report has been dropped off at the client's test folder on Pilot.

*/d/SECURE4/FTPRoot/spcu/test/Enrollment_Status_011322.csv*



The file name contains a timestamp because if it doesn't then the file will be overridden. This is to address the possibility that the client may forget to pickup the report, then they will lose the previous report as it isoverridden because of same file name.

comment: [~mac], doesn't QA need to review before I send to the client for review?

Thanks

Hi Daphne, no, QA doesn't need to review it. QA isn't expecting it either.

comment: [~mac] [~tai.trinh], please advise. I would like to have QA review before I have the client review. Thanks

Can you check the generated report on Pilot to see if it has the correct columns, output, and format.

The report was dropped off at*/d/SECURE4/FTPRoot/spcu/test/Enrollment_Status_011322.csv.*
Let me know if you can't find it and I will attach the report.

comment: [~mac], please see SPCU's feedback:

I reviewed and we need each Account Number to be listed on a separate line item. Examples on lines 2, 5, 6, and 8 are joint accounts but these accounts need to be listed separately so the automated import process can import them individually.

Also, we nolonger need the email address so please remove this data from the output file.

Please provide a new sample.

Thanks
