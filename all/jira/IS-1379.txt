Sorry to say but looking at the production code pgp extension is already removed for return files. We don't need to do anything here. Sorry, while assessing I didn't go through the code well enough to check this.

Need your help here.

ffinddla,dlb,dna,ilt are redtitan job. And the update is to remove the PGP extension from the return files. Would you please assign onshore dev to handle this?

My apology that, I didn't realize that the app has PGP return files that say invalid address report. No other apps need the updated. So you can assign this story to onshore dev.
