title: WECU - 18862 - 5498 [18862][pvt][Summary]
description: To be clear, I am asking for 5498s to be generated for accounts that have $0.00 in contributions, but that do have a value in the FMV (box 5).

I confirmed with our IRA Administrator (Ascensus) and the IRS website (excerpt included below) that these accounts are required to have a 5498 completed.




 * Contributions.
