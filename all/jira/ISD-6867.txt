title: SURU [26671] [pvt] InfoTrac Fix
description: SURU InfoTrac Fix

My proposal to solve is to update the auth file. I think the file (Example: ml1_SURU_AUTH_03162022.txt) is coming from the print processing. Currently, there are 3 fields: account number, account name, and email address. I want another field for delivery preference. The value will be either be E for electronic and B for paper. On your side, if the NP value is PAPER, then you will include it in the eStatement index file for posting, and in the auth file, the delivery preference value will be B. For the current statements that are already in the eStatement index file, still include them in the index file, but in the auth file, the delivery preference field will have a value of E. This way, all the statements will be posted.

Hi Igor, can you QA this?

These are the index and auth files you can post and verify. You will need to check that the account's delivery preference gets updated correctly and you can see the statements posted.

Hi Shun,

I processed on staging 2 index files as AUTH processing from first row, both have zero good accounts, only warning and no accounts numbers in these processing.

Ref #193182, 193183

Thank you,

Natasha

comment: [~nprimak] one is a statement index file, the other is an auth file:
ms6_SURU_AUTH_04052022.txt - Auth processing
ms6_20221231_2_20220412_1604_suru.txt - Doc processing

[~rony] This file ms6_SURU_AUTH_04052022.txt seems to be missing the delivery preference column compared to the rest of the auth files, hence the warnings that Natasha is seeing. Can you take a look?

Hi Rony, I processed successfully on pilot 'ms6_SURU_AUTH_04052022.txt', I see pdf statements posted for the accounts

The index file 'ms6_20221231_2_20220426_2109_suru.txt' was processed before on Pilot and I see pdf statements for the accounts from this processing

Do i need to process and test all provided index files on PILOT?

I started to do processing on staging and most of I tried failed to process because of missing job_id.

Thank you,

Natasha
