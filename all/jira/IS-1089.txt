comment: [~Bryanl]I have a question about this. Are we expected to subtract the two tax fields from the total value above it?

Client responded with:

I've reviewed transactions on the prior core and they broke it out as three separate line items. Unfortunately, Keystone does not, so will need to have InfoImage add logic to subtract the <federalIncomeTaxWithheld> and the <stateIncomeTaxWithheld> from the <grossAmount>. Note: there are times when a member does not elect to have either federal or state income tax withheld so we have to ensure the logic is flexible so it doesn't fail if one of these two items are empty.

comment: [~Bryanl]Do we also need to subtract from the balance column or just leave i blank like the image?

comment: [~thomasY]& [~Bryanl]: I confirmed with both Thomas & Bryan that this can be schedule to release for next EOM (i.e. before 6/30). Obviously we will release this a lot earlier once we get the approval for the other Jira ticket issue that SPCU reported in regards to the middle initial:

[IS-1159] SPCU - [29067][pvt][in-house] Monthly Statement incorrectly mapping Joint Owner Name. Adding a "C" as middle initial that is not in statement file - Jira (infoimageinc.com)
