title: 23107 - LCCU - Members cannot view estatements
description: All members could not access our site. Issue stemmed from the client sending us the SSO request in JSON format, which we have never formally agreed to supporting. Apparently Q2 had always been sending over the request in JSON and it was fine before regardless, however sometime in September, there was an update made for BANB which inadvertently disabled JSON requests from being accepted. However we were never made aware by Q2 nor the client that the requests would be in JSON, and furthermore all the other Q2 clients don't use JSON, therefore we are not at fault.
