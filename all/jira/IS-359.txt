Eric, can you please update smart sheet for new forms ready for testing?


author: tuna
comment: Hi [~eric.yan], I spoke to [~Igor.Khosid] for sample attachment. QA will checkthe samples *ONLY* that attached in Smartsheet,. Because Smartsheet is more organized to search the sample PDFs. *Could you please make sure you attached sample PDF files in smartsheet and change to "Ready for QA" under "IS Status"?*



Hi [~nprimak]: Pleasethe samples *ONLY* that attached in Smartsheet.

For 1042S, comments from DSI

"Little bit confused here. The left side of the screenshot is code output, right? And the right side is from publication pdf? So what should I do again? Remove or add the line?"

I agree with DSI, since it's the publication missing the first line of footnotes. Could you verify the publication is correct?


author: eric.yan
comment: [~nprimak]

I've checked the publication of 1042s, the nonstandard form has combined all backers of standard form into one page. So I think the current backer is correct. Please confirm.


author: nprimak
comment: [~eric.yan] [~Igor.Khosid] 

Eric,

In my screen shot for 1042S sample form is on the left and IRS form is on the right. IRS form you can find in story IS-355 and name of pdf file is f1042s.pdf

Both forms have different lay out, and IRS form has backers for Copy B, C and D. Our samples have only Copy B, it is confusing

But I see Samples have extra line which needs to be removed to match IRS form, it is such a small difference. possible can be ignored, no one will notice.

Verified nonstandard forms:

1099int_banbyt199i131.sam.pdf --> with IRS form backer 1099-INT_2021

5498sa_banbyt18sa131.sam.pdf --> with IRS form backer f5498sa_21

5498ESA_banbyt1esa131.sam.pdf --> with IRS form backer 5498ESA_2021

- no issues

New samples are ready.

For 1042S, the non standard tax sample combined the backers of copy B, C and D.


author: nprimak
comment: [~eric.yan] [~Igor.Khosid]

I don't see new sample, the sample attached to smart sheet already verified, QA completed. print samples verified and pass also.

If you add any changes/fixes please provide new sample


author: eric.yan
comment: [~nprimak]

The 7 new samples are 1099DIV, 1099NEC, 1099SA, 1099B, 1099S, 1099O, 1099Q and attached to the smart sheet and here as well.

Bryan has requested print sample and should be available soon.


author: eric.yan
comment: [~nprimak] [~Igor.Khosid] 

I don't think 1042s needs a fix, since the nonstandard backer is a combination of multiple pages standard tax backer. The highlighted tax in your screenshot comes from the backer of copy B of standard tax.

Here is the checklist for parallel, you could use it for all forms.


author: nprimak
comment: [~eric.yan] [~Igor.Khosid] 

Eric, please verify 1099B nonstandard sample form, you have 'Instructions for Recipient' after first statement same as backer on IRS form 1099B standard and it is correct.

Next statement in the same sample is for form 1099D, with IRS backer for form 1099D

Why 2 forms are in the same sample 1099B and 1099D?


author: nprimak
comment: [~eric.yan] [~Igor.Khosid] 

Form 1099-OID non standard has sample attached to smart sheet with statement for 1099-B and 1099-D, sample is same as for 1099B above


author: eric.yan
comment: [~nprimak]

The sample print file got mixed up probably because all tax forms are coming from the same file. But the correspondingly 1099-B and 1099-D backers are loaded correctly.

I've redo the pdf sample for 1099-OID and put it here and smartsheet. I'll have Bryan to request for the right copy of print sample for 1099-OID as well.


author: eric.yan
comment: [~nprimak]

My appologies, I found that all samples are the same with 1099-B and 1099-D only. I'm uploading new samples for 1099-NEC, 1099-Q, 1099-S, 1099-SA as well.


author: nprimak
comment: [~eric.yan] [~TunA] [~Igor.Khosid]

Verified the following non-standard forms:

1099-NEC, 1099-Q, 1099-S. 1099-SA. 1099-OID ---> no issues

Asking again to confirm, what i mention before:

In standard forms 1099-B has backer and 1099-DIV had different backer, but in non-standard sample forms 1099-B and 1099-DIV have same content as combine backer for both standard forms.

Why 2 different forms have same combine text 1099B and 1099D?


author: eric.yan
comment: [~nprimak]

The 1099B and 1099D are in the same pdf file, but their backers are different. The first page is 1099B, the second page is 1099D.

file: banbyt199d101.sam.pdf

page 1: 1099-B front

page 2: 1099-B backer

page 3: 1099-D front

page 4: 1099-D backer

comment: [~eric.yan] [~Igor.Khosid] [~TunA] 

Eric, just confirm on more time, you have in one sample two forms 1099-B and 1099-C, correct?


author: nprimak
comment: [~eric.yan] [~TunA] [~TunA] 

Igor just verified print samples, they are same combined for both form as provided in a smart sheet, it means all good


author: william.kong
comment: Per [~eric.yan]update, he is waiting for the parallel to be completed so that he can release all the forms.


author: eric.yan
comment: [~nprimak] [~Igor.Khosid]

How is the 5498SA print sample? It's the only one left to perform parallel testing.


author: igor.khosid
comment: [~eric.yan]

Eric - the sample - looks good and I already updated Smartsheet "2021 Tax Forms Update "


author: eric.yan
comment: all nonstandard tax resources are released.
