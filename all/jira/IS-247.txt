comment: Hi Igor,

Nar is off for 07/26 and 07/27. Please review this update and let me know.

Basically we need to change the arrival data files path from /d/ftpbu/kfcubu to /d/ftpbu/JHABU/kfcu/\{$FOLDER}/.

We cannot test the update. So you can only DIFF the program see, if all the paths are changed.

Thanks,

Tun
