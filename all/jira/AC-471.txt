Timeline:

Turnover to IS 2/1/22

Samples to QA 2/8/22

LIVE date 2/10/22



bypass parallel and no need for sample approval (unless client wants it then let us know).



We will need to create invert lists for each of the tax form and reprocess as segment 2. I will create the invert lists once QA passes.
