title: WFCU:  Monthly/Visa/Mortgage Statement:  PDF Archival Add Cleanup Logic (In-house)
description: Parallel Required: Yes (Run Paper, eStmt & PDF) to make sure all service perform without issues.



Please review the wfcu_archival.pl perl script that is shared with several WFCU application inside the isisdisk.sh. There is a bug where the program does not clear the/d/pdf_afp/wfcu/wfcums1/backup/ & /d/pdf_afp/wfcu/wfcums3/backup/ & /d/pdf_afp/wfcu/wfcumv1/backup & & /d/pdf_afp/wfcu/wfcuml1/backup folder+before+ beginning the PDF archival program. Files are constantly being accumulated.



I looked at the snippet of the code. I+think+ we need to add the following lines in red below (Please evaluate if my assessment is correct):



{{&printlog( "Cleaning archival directories...\n" );}}
 {{system( "rm -f ${pdf_afp}*" );}}
 {{system( "rm -rf $pdfDir" );}}
 {{system( "rm -rf $xmlDir" );}}

{color:#de350b}{{system( "rm -rf $backupDir" );}}{color}

{color:#de350b}{{# Also move the following line of code up here (look 7 lines down)}}{color}

{color:#de350b}{{# mkdir $backupDir if ( ! -d $backupDir );}}{color}

{{system( "mv -f ${zipDir}* $backupDir" );}}
