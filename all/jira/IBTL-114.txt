comment: [~Peter.Dang]: Can you have someone assess this issue? I spoke with Neil as Jason was creating this ticket.  He stated that there were no error message in the log so Jason cannot provide any screenshot. All he observed was that PUI was never triggered.

comment: [~jasramos]: Per our Tuesday Brisbane meeting, Peter stated that the issue is related to high cripples. Because of high cripple the global programming does not trigger PUI processing. Regardless, according to Peter, he stated that you guys should get an email alert informing you that eStatement could not be posted to PUI.



Can you review your emails to confirm if you got it?



[~Peter.Dang]: Per our spark, i want to make sure Jason did get the email before closing this ticket.



Thanks!

comment: Looked through script, found errors in log files due to estmt_selective_ins.pl

probably need to make sure the eslective insert/insert bins are being used correctly and reprocess.

log file for DDA is /d/fcsb_dda_process.log

comment: There are actually multiple log files. Even I had to look through script to find this log.
