comment: Hi [~mousumiS] 

For some letters we can do it if account number comes into data file before the double nesting verbiage, right ?

But if account number exists in data file after double nesting verbiage which I found in many letters or there is no account number in data file which have no eStatement then we can't add account number in Aborting message.

That's why , I tried to keep this Aborting message consistent for all letters explaining that double nesting verbiage shouldn't come before anchor.

[~rony]Can you please advise me here ?

Thanks!
