title: FCBT - [30662][pvt] FCBT - PLBA: Separate processing segments for 'Simple Bill' and 'Simple Bill Statement' files
description: TITLE: FCBT - PLBA: Separate processing segments for 'Simple Bill' and 'Simple Bill Statement' files

Application: LIQ Simple Bills







Description:

Permanent update to separate processing of files for 'LIQ Simple Bills'.

Currently, we process two file names together (if received):



SIMPLE BILL: <CID>_liq_simpbill_<exportID>_<MMDDYYYY>.txt.pgp

SIMPLE BILL STATEMENT: <CID>_liq_simpbillstmt_<exportID>_<MMDDYYYY>.txt.pgp



Recommendation to process as different segments if possible:

Simple Bill as Segment 01 - 10.

Simple Bill Stmt as Segment 11 - 20.



IS ASSESSMENT:

2hr - Update Script fcbt_lq1_process_wrapper.sh

2hr - Update Script fcbt_lq1_process.sh

5hr - Testing all 15 associations

Total = 9hrs - IS hours  + Zero ISD hours



NOTES FOR DEVELOPER:

Please update scripts: fcbt_lq1_process_wrapper.sh & fcbt_lq1_process.sh. Add coding logic that will make sure each datafile is ran with the correct segment, for example:

If datafile =<CID>_liq_simpbill_<exportID>_<MMDDYYYY>.txt.pgp(Simple Bill), then make sure the segment is 1 - 10.

If datafile =<CID>_liq_simpbillstmt_<exportID>_<MMDDYYYY>.txt.pgp (Simple Bill Statement), then make sure the segment is 11 - 20.



Set and test crontab with 2 entries. One to to be set as segment 1 for Simple Bill and the other set as segment 11 for the Simple Bill Statement.



NOTE: Client only sends 1 segment per day, in the event any extra segments are sent, they will need to be processed manually.

Hi Phoebe, any updates on this?

Thanks,
Sam

comment: Hi Sam, it looks like the DPVS counts are reversed.

Segment 11 notes that the file name: CID>_liq_simpbill_<exportID>_<MMDDYYYY>.txt.pgp.

Segment 1 notes the file name: plba_liq_simpbillstmt_242_05112022.txt.pgp

I believe it should be reversed, but it could have also been how you named the PDF itself. Can you confirm? The counts seem to reflect the correct file name though.

Hi Phoebe, it looks to me that each of the two segments processed the correct file (e.g. segment 1 processed simpbill, and segment 11 processed simpbillstmt) according to the counts like you mentioned, but the transmission filename listed on the DPVS is wrong.

I'll have to look into this further.

Thanks,
Sam

comment: [~SamV2021] Thank you!

The customer also requested the following for one more set of counts/samples:

_One last item before we approve: could you also check with your team and provide the number for 7/30 bill drop date? any 2 or 3 associations will work._



Here are additional files that can be used:

Thank you,

As requested, I have produced additional samples/DPVS for the files you showed above. The issue where the DPVS shows the wrong transmission file name has also been fixed (before this fix, the previously processed file was shown instead of the file currently being processed).

Simple Bill (segment 1):
 * PLBA
 ** DPVS:[^plbalq1111_dpvs_segment1.pdf]
 ** Sample:[^plbalq1111_sample_segment1.pdf]
 * CAFC
 ** DPVS:[^cafclq1130_dpvs_segment1.pdf]
 ** Sample:[^cafclq1130_sample_segment1.pdf]

Simple Bill Statement (segment 11):
 * PLBA
 ** DPVS:[^plbalq11111_dpvs_segment11.pdf]
 ** Sample:[^plbalq11111_sample_segment11.pdf]
 * CAFC
 ** DPVS:[^cafclq11130_dpvs_segment11.pdf]
 ** Sample:[^cafclq11130_sample_segment11.pdf]

Hi Phoebe, please create a MPT for parallel testing.

Thanks,

comment: [~SamV2021] I was providing some screenshots to FCBT on what the different 'segments' look like on Job Status, so I had pulled from InfoTrac Staging.

We noticed that the Segment 01 and Segment 11 were tied to 'LIQ Simple Statements'

!image-2022-09-29-10-46-51-618.png!

Currently for LIQ Simple Bills application (LQ1, it shows up on InfoTrac as circled below:

!image-2022-09-29-10-47-36-611.png!



In checking the DPVS's and assessment from the samples/test, it is showing the lq1 application, so just wanted to make sure. LIQ Simple Statements uses prefix LS1.



Thanks,

Phoebe

Hi Phoebe, 'Stmt - LIQ Simple' in the 'Application ID' column is tied to the version# used in the DT_JOB_ID. For my own testing in staging, I went with the previously used version# (which was whatever was in the insert files  V22403 which in PC's database is linked to 'Stmt - Liq Simple'). As long as the correct version number is used, 'Invoice - LIQ Simple Bills' should be what is displayed.

Once DP is done processing in parallel, we can double-check to ensure that 'Invoice - LIQ Simple Bills' is what is shown.

Thanks,
 Sam
