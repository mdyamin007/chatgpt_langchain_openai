* We are also going to update the DSO enrollment steps. 
* Update enrollment steps; currently during enrollment, the user will have the option to select to optin for paperless or stay with getting the paper
statement.
* Only allow the user to choose paperless option for HK statements when they signed in with SSO.
* InfoImage will hide the delivery preference option for users if the account types are for HK.

EWBBI just validated in pilot but they are still getting both paper and electronic options as the screenshot below.  Can you please advise if this is correct? comment # 54 in T# 20382

Please see EWBB response below.

I wanted to check with you again on this story and not sure if we have reverted the change made for HK login?
This ticket was created where we need to update HK eStatement enrollment so HK users only select electronic delivery as the option, as you highlighted in the screenshot. I just validated in pilot but I !Screenshot 1.png|thumbnail!  !Screenshot 2.png|thumbnail! 'm still getting both paper and electronic options as the screenshot below. 
Just want to make sure we have the setup and have it schedule for production release. Thanks. 

Thanks, Barnett

comment: Hi Barnett. I reviewed the pilot site and saw that for accounts in the HK region/branch, that the delivery preference was only paperless. Here's a screenshot. Let me review with Tai if there are more parameters that need to be included.

comment: Hi Barnett,



I've reviewed the code and found the extra account types that need to be included in the logic for paperless only. I'll be working on this today and update you by tomorrow morning.

comment: Hi [~barnetts] ,



Changes are now up on pilot for client review. Can we request that they test on both SSO and DSO steps?



Thanks
