I've attached the SLCU API Auth Doc I sent over through email to you and phoebe on 3/2.

For the pilot site information, please contact Mac on his Jira tickets related to SLCU.

comment: [~Ethan.Yu] SLCU says:

 Lumin reported that they are still experiencing connectivity issues to the API URL. They are going to pull logs, but sent the below screenshot of the error theyre receiving. It doesnt really provide any information so Im thinking the logs will be more helpful.

The account used was 346478 and the last logon attempt was 04/06/22 at 1:22 Pacific.

Do the Lumin public IPs need to be whitelisted? If so those IPs are:



uat - 104.171.198.85
 prod- 104.171.198.86prod - 104.171.198.87

comment: Hi [~kericapote],

I've updated the API information onto Pilot. Let's have the client test again. It looks like the screenshot they provided wasn't attached.

Can I get a screenshot and logs from the client if they continue to have issues accessing our API calls?

comment: Hi [~kericapote],

I notice at least one issue with their request. I'll update this fully later today. If possible can you see if the client has time today for a meeting to discuss this and work it out on a call? This way we can get it working quicker.


author: kericapote
comment: [~Ethan.Yu] checking on this info. SLCU is requesting a call. I will schedule tomorrow or Thursday if Sean and Mac can't answer their questions.

comment: Hey [~kericapote],

When is the live date of this project?


author: 5ba31365b1a4b82e99864b79
comment: Hi [~kericapote],

Following up. Can you help update the live date for this?


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~Ethan.Yu]

As discussed, please check the database on the application description that is being passed to Lumin in the API call. They noted based on the field/parameter that you provided that the description is appearing as 'NA'.

I'll request a screenshot as well.

[~kericapote] FYI


author: kericapote
comment: [~Ethan.Yu] pilot site is approved (based on the index files that IS provided), but we are pending a final launch date to update the live date (pending confirmation on SSO side for ISD with the client).


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~Ethan.Yu] [~mac] - SLCU reported the following on the API side for Lumin; can you check this and confirm if it may have to do with leading zeros being present? I'm not sure why this would be different though between the API and SSO side:

comment: Hi [~phoebe.george], [~kericapote]

Can we ask SLCU/Lumin to provide IP addresses that the requests will be coming in from? That way we can whitelist it for them.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~Ethan.Yu] Here are the IP's for Lumin for production:

!image-2022-09-09-16-09-20-225.png!

I noticed that the status of this story was release ready, however, there are still issues reported by the CU/Lumin on the API side - please provide an update on the previous comments. Thanks!
