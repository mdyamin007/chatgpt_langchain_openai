 I think we don't need to compare the sample.
 The issue is not on the dfa. We don't need to update the dfa.

The issue on control file, misc_type="mis".
 when it is "mis", accounts with missing address will be sorted into 5.mis file on DPVS.
 And 5.mis will be printed and mailed.
 Client request to NOT mail those accounts.
 So update: misc_type="rpt"
 DPVS will not have 5.mis section. instead those accounts will be sorted into NON-PRINT 5.rpt on DPVS.

Here is the DPVS with 5.mis section from production on 10/01:[^spcudna301.print.114238].

Thanks
