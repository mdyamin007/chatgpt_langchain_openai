comment: There will be a change in the backend analysis. After getting the auth file from Michael, Ive found that auth doesnt support leading zeros for account_number in fin_account table. And in the doc, its said that auth supports leading zeros. So that needs to be changed.  But I cant edit/delete the attached doc, so thats why I''m leaving a note.

comment: We are using account number as CIF in usr_mapping table while creating users. Let us know if thats okay as this client also passes SSN number in the auth file. But it also creates users in afp processing and SSN number cant be retrieved in that process. Thats why we are keeping account number as the CIF number.

comment: I know there were some issues brought up on Thursdays meeting regarding reports. I only see the backend analysis so is there also an analysis on the admin site ready or not?
