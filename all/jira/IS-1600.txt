parallel required.

Programmer: Rony



Details:

---------------------

Need to display encrypted account no besides account no

Client expected output is :

*****8727795C2TC7RC(masked entireaccount no + <space>+encrypted account) . Per client in comment 16 both can be of max 10 length and since client wants an space between those while displaying total length we need is 21.

Currently for 1098 :





It is using 21,40 position for display and

751-770 position for index file for segment 1, 21-40 for segment 2 and 3.

We can put the account no and encrypted account no in column 751-771 (length 21) for display (since we need to put a space between account no and encrypted account no ), and the account no for index in 21-40.

So we need to set a rule with field 751-771 for tax_acctnum_main table in tax_insert_table.sql file



INSERT INTO tax_acctnum_main (ref_number,start_pos,end_pos,split_by,remove_zeros,acct_pos_loc,suf_pos_loc,suf_display, acct_n_suf_order) VALUES ('77','751','771','blank','1','blank','blank','as_is', 'a');

which we will use for display.



and for e_index we need to change for tkcu segment 1 which is using rule 50 currently. We can change to use rule 1 instead.

So overall for tax_acctnum_ref table



CID | FORM | SEGMENT | DISPLAY | E_INDEX |

tkcu|1098|1|751|1|

tkcu|1098|2|751|47|

tkcu|1098|3|751|48|

tkcu|rest|all|751|1|



there is already a preprocessing script for 1098 tkcu_1098_spec_handle.pl where it puts member number from cross reference file to irs data file in position 751-770 position. And it is taking account no from 21-40 position and ssn from 12-20 position to match with cross reference file. We have to build another preprocessing script for all tkcu forms which will be called before tkcu_1098_spec_handle.pl per tax process, we will put account no, space , encrypted account no combination in field 751-771 for display. And,

we need to make a slight change in tkcu_1098_spec_handle.pl, instead of putting member no in 751-770 put this in 21-40 , so basically we will replace the account no with member no for 1098.

Test file,TKCU_ENCRPTACCT.pgp, has been uploaded to the Test folder.

comment: Hi [~billr]

Can I have a test data file too?

And if I don't find a match with Xref file account no, what should we do? Will we just display the account no only without an encryption number?

Thanks

comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid]



/d/ac-secure-share/ac/bill/is-1600/TKCU_1099R_311_2020.zip is the archival sample for 1099r where the client can see the update (encrypted number besides account no )as well as verify the archival is ok too.

[~billr]

to process1098FICS there is a xref file needed in the format*loanID|ssn|ytd_taxes_paid_amt|SymitarAccountNum*

I need this file for testing purposes. Would it be possible to provide this?



Thanks

I am following up with the client for thexref file.

Client previously provided the test fileTKCU_ENCRPTACCT.pgp, to the Test folder. Do you also still need a data file?


author: rony
comment: Hi [~billr]

TKCU_ENCRPTACCT.pgp is another xref file for the account number to encrypt no mapping. I am talking about IRS data files. But it's ok I have some IRS data files. But I still need the Xref file*loanID|ssn|ytd_taxes_paid_amt|SymitarAccountNum.*



Thanks

note: Form1099-Rchecked
 In the archival samples for 1099r -> /d/ac-secure-share/ac/bill/is-1600/TKCU_1099R_311_2020.zip displayed masked account number + <space>+encrypted account number:

 The substitution of the encrypted account number on the form is based on the matches of account numbers in the Xref files:

Rony client is asking:

You have also provided a formatloanID|ssn|ytd_taxes_paid_amt|SymitarAccountNum

The Symitar Account number - you would need to be the actual account number and not Encrypted Account Number, correct?


author: rony
comment: Hi [~billr]



Loan id will match with irs actual account no ( 21-40 ) and SymitarAccuntNum will be like member number ( not encrypted ) that will be used for posting for 1098FICS.



Thanks

comment: Hi [~Andrey.Kutsenko]



/d/ac-secure-share/ac/bill/is-1600/TKCU_1098_311_2021.zip is an archival sample. The same folder also hastkcuyt1098.pdf full sample for 1098 fics. This is the last form I wanted to turn over to QA, cause it has a data manipulation or preprocessing script to manipulate data tkcu_1098_spec_handle.pl which takes another cross-reference file
z/download/tkcu/TKCU_1098_FICSBox11_12302021.txt withformatloanID|ssn|ytd_taxes_paid_amt|SymitarAccountNum. So wanted to turnover this form to QA too.

Just to refresh our task is to display encrypted no besides account no for which the client provides a xref file with account|encrypted account format.
In the pdftkcuyt1098.pdf page 105 you will see such an example. For those who don't get a match with the Xref file, we are displaying only account no.

Rony, I have requested DP make the files available to the client for review/approval.


author: billr
comment: [~rony] [~Jessica]

Rony, I sent the following samples to the client:

TKCU_1098_311_2021.zip has been copied to /d/infoftps3/tkcu/client_pickup successfully
tkcuyt1098.pdf has been copied to /d/infoftps3/tkcu/client_pickup successfully

And they responded:

After initial review of both files that were sent over, I was not able to locate the encrypted account number next to the account number on the tax forms. Am I missing something? Was it placed somewhere else?


author: rony
comment: Hi [~billr]

Below are some page nos to look at:

105 110 171 277 351 689 707 838 1017 1052 1078 1174 1301 1334 1363 1489 1808 1814 1968 2097 2197 2369 2434 2506 2566 2792 3016 3081 3292 3318 3480 3483 3528 3978



For the rest of the accounts, it didn't match with the Xref file.



Thanks

Rony, client responded to:

I have been able to look at a few samples and all the samples account numbers appear to be wrong. The name, socials, and addresses appear to be correct, but the account numbers are not correctly aligned with each member - even the ones with the Encrypted Account numbers appearing.


author: rony
comment: Hi [~billr]

If the client can provide us with some examples would be helpful.



Thanks


author: rony
comment: Hi [~billr]I am not sure why client is saying account nos and encrypted nos are appearing wrong. Let me give you some example with snapshot of xref file for encryption:

So please ask the client what is exactly wrong here?



Thanks

comment: [~rony]

Rony, I will send the examples to the client. The client had responded below and provided the attached file, Document2.docx before they saw your examples.

The accounts are accounts I found within our core - you can see that each last 4 account number on tax forms are incorrect. I also went back and made sure that the accounts that didn't have Encrypted Account numbers present in the xref file we created and sent to you, and they are there. So, majority of the files that were sent to review should have Encrypted Account number listed.


author: rony
comment: [~billr]

This is the file from the client. Please ask them to search with the customer name and then check the value from columns 21-40, which is account no.

[^tkcu.1098gen-1.for1]



Note: client didn't send us data in the above naming, the client sent data with a long line and we break down the long line into multiple lines each line is an A or B record, but the content is the same.

Now if the account from this file seems wrong we need a replacement file from the client.



Thanks

This will need extra programming. It's good that we provided a sample for 1098 fics otherwise this will never be caught until production release. But based on current workload I need time to implement this. I will be able to make the update and provide a sample by mid-next week.



Thanks

Rony, client is asking:

Can you find out why 1099-C does not have the Encrypted Account Number? The Business Area owner wants to know.

I thought this was because it had a hyphened loan ID but is it because of something else?


author: rony
comment: Hi [~billr]

Yes, the client is correct, the hyphened loaned id is causing the issue. Please ask the client how should we proceed then.



Thanks


author: billr
comment: [~rony] [~Jessica]

Rony, Customer responded:

I thought that was the case. How simple is it for the developer to leave the Loan ID in place while still placing the Encrypted Account Number in the same area? If this is simple, please add and we'll get the sample approved immediately so we can go live.


author: rony
comment: Hi [~billr]

/d/ac-secure-share/ac/bill/is-1600/11152022/tkcuyt199c.pdf is an updated sample for 1099c.



Thanks


author: billr
comment: [~rony]

Rony, I will send samples to client for approval.


author: billr
comment: [~rony] [~Jessica]

Rony, client responded to most recent samples:

Is there a maximum number of characters that can be present in the account number field?

I was able to locate all 8 accounts I looked at; however, I noticed the Encrypted Account Number was missing a few characters on each. My instant thought was because the last 4 of loan ID was there and there was no more room. Just wanted to confirm before we move on to final steps.


author: rony
comment: Looking into this. Will get back to you asap.


author: rony
comment: Hi [~billr]

I updated the code to accommodate total of 26 digits (10-digit account no, 1 hyphen, 4-digit loan, 1 space, 10-digit encrypted account no).

Below are updated samples for 99c (the client sees the issue ) and 98e ( to check if the latest update doesn't affect other forms).

[^tkcuyt199c.pdf]

[^tkcuyt198e.pdf]



I also want to provide a sample for 1042s since the account no location for this form is different from other forms. Would you please ask the client to provide a test file for 1042s?



Thanks








author: billr
comment: [~rony] [~Jessica]

Thanks Rony, I will follow up with the client.


author: billr
comment: [~rony]

Rony, client responded and provided the file:1042-S IRS Reporting List.txt

We don't have very many 1042s. Matter of fact, I don't know if we currently have any accounts right now but looked at previous year tax statements and found a list. Let me know if this is what you need?
