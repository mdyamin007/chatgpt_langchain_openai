title: AUTOCAMPAIGN ssh credentials to input servers issue
description: Hello,

I believe we can recall about one of our feature named AUTOCAMPAIGN from notifyservice where we actually make a SCP call to printprocess02 server /z/isd_share or /d/isd_share directory and fetch CSV file from there, at the end that CSV file is being used for email and sms sending purpose.

For the new facility I believe we are going to use ca-preproc-pr-02.infoimageinc.com what will be the location of CSV file, will it be same as before?

Thanks

The notifyservice program will access the server, not any human. the previous credential was something like the following -

Username: pdev1
Password: infoimage

We have already asked for the port access so that notifyservice app can able to ssh to that machine.

Thanks

comment: Will : So you have a id_rsa.pub key that I can add into the pdev1 .ssh/authorized_keys file? That would make it seemless ssh login.

I can generate an RSA key for password-less login but I will need to change the

code of the application as that only supports login with credentials.

Thanks

William,



Can we keep the same format as it is now until we have time to make the change later?

I want to avoid having to make code change and delay our configuration and testing.



Thanks
