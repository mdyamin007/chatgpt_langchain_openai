comment: [~thomasY] The index file ms1_08312022_09142022_1312_epcu.txt is lacking most of the expected fields, thus it errored during posting on stage. Below is a few lines from the file:

Can you advise?

comment: Actually [~berezinez], can you try reposting the file with AFP processing and see if the issue persists? I just realized on production they use Doc processing for enotices and AFP processing for monthly statements.


author: berezinez
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] [~thomasY]

AFP processing posting looks good.
