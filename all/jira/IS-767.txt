comment: Hi Hamim,

Here is the feedback from client. See comment #46, #48 and #50 in TS#263936.

1. The date on the coupon section should be right justified to match the rest of the data



!https://app.na3.teamsupport.com/dc/1888578/images/ad8f9f15-d025-4ce4-aec0-f1b1f20d37d0.png!

2. The logo (without the po box address) should be on all subsequent pages, it is presently missing from pages 3 and 5.

3. Client updated the mockup and highlighted the items that need to be revisited as they do not seem to be completely accurate. See attached updated mock up.

For #5, can you provide an example of an account that has this situation so we can see if it is resolved or not? I think if you search through the Mortgage MRD009 for *** NO ACTIVITY *** there should be some examples.

comment: Hi [~dawnl] 

[^pfcuml2120_5.pdf]this is example for #5 NO ACTIVITY.

[^PFCUML21_logo.pdf]this is cample for subsequent page logo. We modified the data to generate this.

And we revisited for point 3 the highlighted items and it looks ok to us. But if the client sees an issue please ask the client to provide examples.


author: dawnl
comment: Hi Rony/Hamimul,

Here is client's comment:

1. The location of the logo on the subsequent pages should have the top of the logo at the same position as the top of the 'Mortgage Billing Statement' text so that the margin is even all of the way across.

2. For items 2) and 7), the cell height is still not correct.the cell height is not as large as those in the HELOC for both tables and the font within the table on the coupon is not as large as the font for the HELOC statement.


author: rony
comment: Hi [~dawnl]

[^PFCUML21.pdf]check this sample.

We don't see the cell height issue in the top right box. We changed the font for the below box and updated the logo position. Please provide to the client and let us know.

The following has not fixed yet in[^PFCUML21.pdf]:
 # The location of the logo on the subsequent pages should have the top of the logo at the same position as the top of the 'Mortgage Billing Statement' text so that the margin is even all of the way across.

Please make the change and provide updated sample.

Thanks.

Please make the cell height the same as those in HELOC. Please refer to the attached mockup 03222022 for items 2) and 7).

"For items 2) and 7), the cell height is still not correct. the cell height is not as large as those in the HELOC for both tables and the font within the table on the coupon is not as large as the font for the HELOC statement."

Please check the images box1.PNG andbox2.PNG attached in the attachment sections. I provided snapshot to compare both heloc and mortgage for both boxes. I am also providing sample for heloc here.

[^PFCUML11.pdf]

Would you please compare this pdf to our last provided sample[^PFCUML21-1.pdf]yourself first to see if you can notice the discrepancy in the box cell height client is seeing?




author: dawnl
comment: Hi Rony,

box1.PNG andbox2.PNG looks good. But when compare heloc[^PFCUML11.pdf]to mortgage [^PFCUML21-1.pdf], the height of last cell is not the same. What is the height of the cell?

comment: Hi [~dawnl]

That seems much too picky behavior to me. The cell heights are .19 inches for box1.
