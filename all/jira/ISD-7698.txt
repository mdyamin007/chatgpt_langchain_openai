title: SPCU - [32630][pvt][in-house] eStatement Platform Maintenance
description: On Saturday, September 17, 2022, InfoIMAGE will be conducting an update to our e-statement platform, Hypercube. The scheduled update will improve the overall experience within the Hypercube application, notably faster response times within the application. Existing functionality will remain the same. If you are interested in participating in pilot testing, please respond to this ticket to prepare the pilot site for testing. If you do not currently have a test environment that is integrated with our pilot site via SSO (single sign on) testing, please contact your OLB service provider.

Hello InfoImage Team  we would like to be included in Pilot Testing. We do have a pilot site setup with NCR Digital Insight and InfoImage for eStatements SSO.
