comment: [~mac] Here is the colors for the hypercube site - mockup from SLCU attached to mirror for the setup. Here are the comments from SLCU below.

[~kericapote] FYI, I attached from SLCU's email dated 3/4 since you are currently OOO.

_IAll active buttons and text links should be our light blue (0072CE), the two header bars should be our dark blue (002D72) and the gray divider line at the top should be (DBDADA). Everything else, wed like to leave as-is (such as the gray border color around the menu items that arent currently active)._

comment: [~mac] It should be the same logo that is used on their current site - are you able to pull from there? Here are the screenshots from the confluence pages:
