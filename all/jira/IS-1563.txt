Ready for client review.

comment: [~avannik] The production dfa contains the word only, so I am assuming we are changing everything up till that point. I'll double-check with tun and Daphne.


author: JIRAUSER11700
comment: [~OIR], we checked - it was indeed in production, so we release it.


author: terrence.tong
comment: [~dyuen][~billr]In the production pdf, the paragraph that we need to change contains the word only at the end but in the description, "only" was omitted. In this case, are we doing a partial change or we are also removing the "only"?

I am following up with the client to determine if they want the word "only" removed.

Wilson, client responded to the sample:

Thanks for the sample letters. They look great and i believe that we can drop that "only" at the end of the new sentence. I'm not sure where it came from but it definitely does not work on the letter.

The test file I had provided had the fields updated to reflect the winder campaign and the skip in December. Would it be possible to get a couple samples without the only and with the new verbiage, just so I have an updated file for the PM.

comment: [~Igor.Khosid] The client has confirmed that they want to remove the word "only". The client would like to see the newest revision, can you please review the newest revision in idcu_sample_2.pdf. Thank you!
