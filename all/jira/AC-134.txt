comment: Per Darryl 10/29:

"Unfortunately, FRST has a new process in place due to their deconversion and being extra budget conscious. They have added an extra step to have their vendor management group review all expenses and the draft paperwork. Apparently, their VM group approved of the estimate back on 10/14, but it never got communicated to Fiserv (even though I asked on multiple occasions) until Wednesday night.

I started the final paperwork and passed it to David McKee to issue the document on Thursday. David is on vacation until Tuesday. I did ask him to expedite it upon his return. I will have an update for you by mid next week on the progress."
