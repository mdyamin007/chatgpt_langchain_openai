LEO: What font type are you using? FFIN would like to standardize the font.

author: rodriguez
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] [~enricob]

Keep in mind that for font we can NOT be as flexible with print image files. There are only a few fonts that will work on print image files or else the alignment will be way off. Two that I know are Lucida Sans Typewriter and Letter Gothic. For this I'm using Lucida Sans Typewriter.

Looks like there are quite a few issues with the letters. I will look at this soon as I finish the LN0860 letters.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~rodriguez]- disregard the font comment. We'll review later after this is all setup.



Regarding the masking, please mask all but the last 4 digits on ALL letters.

Jira did not let me upload the zip, I sent via email instead.


author: JIRAUSER10913
comment: [~rodriguez] [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]

I processed the index files. However, there seems to be a mismatch in the letter codes. In the index files, the letter codes are in the 100s, but in the SOW the letter codes are in the 300s.


author: rodriguez
comment: [~mac] [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]

Yes that is correct, per Peter, we thought it would be best to use 100 instead of 300. We can update the SOW.

Thanks,

Leo

comment: [~rodriguez]

Could you provide index files for the enotices that are more recent?


author: rodriguez
comment: [~mac]

The most recent I have is for cycle 10/18. And that includes only one letter code. Is that sufficient? The rest fall into the same range of the dates of the previous index files. Was there any letter you were looking for specifically ?


author: JIRAUSER10913
comment: [~rodriguez]

Does this include all of the 21 letters? I need recent dates for all 21 letters. The index files that was provided have dates that are within and outside the archival period of 4 months.


author: rodriguez
comment: [~mac] No, it only includes letter 104. The dates are coming from the statement date and all statements are from older cycles. Also, a cycle that has all letters was not provided.

[~mac] Also, just an FYI, letters 107,108, 112, 113, 114, and 120 do not have e-stmts.


author: rodriguez
comment: [~mac] [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]

Hi Mac, is it possible to extend the the archival period ? If so we would need to extend back to 5/11 since that is the earliest data file they sent us for testing.


author: JIRAUSER10913
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]

Yes, we can extend the archival period, but it is billable.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~mac]- Please extend and put the hours here.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~mac]- extend back to May 2021.


author: JIRAUSER10913
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]

Is the archival period extension per client request because it's something that will be done for production, or is this just for testing?


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~mac]- this is just for testing. I understand the pilot site archival period is small but this project has been worked on since May. Which is why we have test files dated that early. If you can extend the archival period so FFIN can view, we should be good.


author: JIRAUSER10913
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]

We can just update the stamp to a more recent date, but of course, the date on the statement will not match the date show on the sites if the client is okay with it. If not, then we really need them to send files within the archival period.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~mac]- the client is ok with this. Please make the update.

comment: [~rodriguez]/[~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]: Please advise if we missed the live date of yesterday; If so, did we impact the customer with our tardiness on getting this project live by 11/22/2021


author: rodriguez
comment: [~William.Kong] [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] , we did miss the live date. This is still in QA. But the tardiness was also due to customer not being able to get their olb vendor issue fixed. We were waiting on that for a while and finally FFIN told us to go forward with just paper while they figure out why they could not view the e-statements; all statements were viewable on our side but not theirs

comment: [~William.Kong] [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]For sure, QA should be done by eod Friday I believe, we just tap tested all letters and there were some minor issues that I will be working on correcting today. I will confirm a new date with Steve.


author: rodriguez
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] [~Igor.Khosid]DPVS and 2 IRF's have been attached for corrected samples. Both IRF's use the same print file and DPVS, I just needed 2 IRF's for the print ranges. They are named "DPVS_CORRECTED.pdf" , "IRF_CORRECTED_1.pdf", and IRF_CORRECTED_2.pdf". Per TS 24817, we will be getting a new disclosure for Letter 112. I will update that letter and disclosure as soon as client provides a new one. Also, Jira orders the attached documents alphabetically and not by date.

author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~mac] [~rodriguez]- From FFIN...

I noticed when looking up a mortgage delinquency solicitation, you had sent account number 000715004342. If I use the leading zeros to lookup the account in Infotrac, it returns the notice.. but if I look it up without the leading zeros, it brings back the account info, but no enotice? This is the same on other notices as well.

When I search for account # 8099251, I see two accounts one designated as DD and one as CK both of those would be considered checking? The notice seemed fine, but having those account type designations seemed odd.

Please advise.


author: rodriguez
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] [~mac]I can correct the leading zero issue by removing all leading zeros, I will make that fix to all letters before releasing. The app code issue is an ISD issue. I'm assigning the correct app code to index file as specified in SOW. As far as why the pilot site is showing 2 app codes for that account is for ISD to address.

On production, the account type DD is being used, butCK is being used instead. Stephen, in the SOW it mentions both DD and CK. Can you double check the SOW that it is correct? If the account types should be DD, then we would need new index files from IS.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~rodriguez]- Are we using account type CK at all? Let me know and I'll update the SOW. Thanks!


author: rodriguez
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]We actually are, per SOW pg 7, letter 117, and 118 are all CK. Letter 110 can be either CK or SV depending on verbiage.


author: tai.trinh
comment: [~rodriguez] [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] 
No account with type CK exists in Production. Are these new accounts that will be created? Or, did we hear "checking" during the meetings and assume CK? For some of the other clients we have, DD is used for checking accounts (as in DDA).

Anyhow, currently in Production, we only have DD account type. Please make sure we're not using the wrong account type. Otherwise, having to fix it later will be a pain.


author: rodriguez
comment: [~tai.trinh]

I don't remember if I heard "checking". But I do know that in pg 7 of SOW, I read, they have specs for Letter 117 & 118 to be all CK and for Letter 110 to be SV OR CK depending on verbiage. This is coming from the BA so it will need to be addressed with them. Maybe they meant DD. Anyhow this will need to be clarified with BA.

author: tai.trinh
comment: [~enricob] [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]

I think it's DD. No account with CK exists currently.

Besides an existence check, there's not really a way to know what type of account it is except via the SOW. Things like DD -> Checking, LN -> Loan don't get saved anywhere except for the SOW, so we should make sure that those mappings are there. Otherwise, we're just going off standard. We have always use DD for checking, so it *should* be a checking account.

Thanks,
Tai
