title: $HOSTNAME on preprocessing02 shows 'ca-preproc-pr-02'
description: Will,

Had issue testing camb dla on RHS BB.

The process uses an older version on afp2web on preprocessing02, Before it does the coversion it checks $HOSTNAME to see if it is preprocessing02 else error.

Since BB preprocessing02 $HOSTNAME shows'ca-preproc-pr-02' /home/master/convert_afp_to_pdf.pl exits out and not do the conversion.

comment: [~jira_naru]: Thank Nar for reporting it. I was hoping that were not specific to preprocessing02 or preprocessing03. I'll ask Prem to fix it and will create a ticket for him to work on.



I'll keep this assigned to me until it is done. Thanks!

comment: [~jira_naru]: Prem updated the hostname just now. Can you retest?

comment: Will,

I retested but still have issue with/home/afp2web/afp2web not available on preprocessing02.

/home/test/master/convert_afp_to_pdf.pl failed.

comment: [~jira_naru]: Sorry about that! There was mount point record in /etc/auto.nfs_prod_home that I did not setup correct for /home/afp2web/. It's fixed now. Please re-test

comment: Will,

I re-tested and coversion of AFP to PDF works (behaves) as expected, similar to Melo's.

However, generating PDF sample, will need to be pushed tocambridgesavingsbank.moveitcloud.com from preprocessing02. Though this will not execute for parallel or testing, I tried to manual [sftpinfoimage@cambridgesavingsbank.moveitcloud.com|mailto:sftp%C2%A0infoimage@cambridgesavingsbank.moveitcloud.com]from BB prepdrocessing02, but it just hang and not prompt me for the password.

We might have an issue pushing the PDF sample.

comment: [~jira_naru]: Thank you for being thorough on this!!!! I need to investigate. Preprocessing02 is a fresh install. I have a feeling the ssh key needs to be installed OR we need to give CAMB our new ssh key. I'm going to change the assignee from you to me so that I do not lose sight of this.

comment: [~jira_naru]: I confirmed your assessment that we cannot connect via sftp to client's server. I'm working with Network team to confirm if they are blocking outbound traffic to external systems. If not, that means we need to either provide the new ssh public key and/or our external Brisbane IP address to vendor

comment: [~jira_naru]: I'm going to close this ticket. The last issue mentioned was that [sftpinfoimage@cambridgesavingsbank.moveitcloud.com|mailto:sftp%C2%A0infoimage@cambridgesavingsbank.moveitcloud.com]is not working. We've completed, IBTL-66 to have Kent & AC team inform our clients and their vendors to open up the access.  We will retest the connection manually once vendors/clients confirmed that the URL is opened.
