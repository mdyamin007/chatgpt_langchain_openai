Subject: RE: File Scanner for parallel environment

We are planning to release the staging file scanner tonight. Going forward one must place the file to /d/test/infoftps(3/4)/CID in order to run parallel or development test.
Files will be pickup by the scanner and place to /d/test/afpbu/CIDBU folder.
I will send another email to confirm the code release.

Junho:

Please help me sync data I3PROD.INCOIMING_FILE with I3.INCOMING_FILE.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Peter
