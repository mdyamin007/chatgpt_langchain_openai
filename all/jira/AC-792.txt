title: MSBK - [30906][pvt][in-house] DP -- SAME DAY -- MSBK Daily Letter 7/22/22 errors and variable messaging (did not finish processing)
description: This issue is caused by inconsistencies between the data file and programming assessment made in TS#23298. More specifically, it was not explicitly stated that the first byte/character of the line containing the account number and amount overdrawn could be a value other than '2', causing the account number and amount overdrawn to not be retrieved properly.

A programming change was not previously made to accommodate this. I will discuss with Peter regarding whether this formatting logic change can be released as a hotfix, or whether additional testing will be needed.
