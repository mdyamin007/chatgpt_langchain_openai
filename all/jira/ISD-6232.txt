comment: [~tohidulI] AOLP is not enabled on our side, so it's not showing under Job Status. I noticed it's not enabled on production either, is setting up AOLP part of this setup? If so then we need to enable it on the ISD side and PC would need to enable estatement job tracking. If we just need to check the estatement itself, then SSCU still has their own pilot admin site which QA should have access to.

comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] can you post this new eStmt index file for Mortgage to SSCU's pilot site:

ml3_20220213_1_20220303_0348_sscu.txt

Please pull down the previous one, this is an updated sample set based on changes they submitted. Thanks!

comment: Hi [~phoebe.george] I've posted the above file on pilot and took down the previous one.

comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] We have received approval on the pilot site (and IS samples). Please prepare any items for QA as needed from the ISD side.


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: Thanks [~phoebe.george], it should just be an additional index file prefix ml3 on our end, which is already added on pilot/stage. With that, QA should be able to post and verify statement output.
