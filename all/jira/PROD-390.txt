Jun,

Can you see if there are any load issue or high usage on the database side from 12 AM till now?
We have several job processing that are accessing and updating the User and usr_mapping, usr_fin_account table and it seem to be running very slow.
I want to see if this is due to high number of database connection or too many request to the same table that may cause the slow respond.
Here are some of the CID that are running doing these time.
WASH, BKFN, FNBT, GCBK.

Thanks
David
