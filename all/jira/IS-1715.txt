Please see client's response to samples below.

A few corrections are not resolved on these latest samples. 

1) Margins of the table
2) Returned/Paid (words in Italics font)
3) Receiving Account Masking to have 7 leading "X"s like our other masked account numbers

Client also provided a new test file for some accounts with more than one line item and would like to review samples of those after you make the above changes.

The client said the samples attached before are old and do not have the new changes reflected in them.

I forgot to rename it with a different name. Here is the newest sample. [^gcbkdl017_1025.pdf]

comment: Hi [~Tevis Mak], GCBK sent a couple new test files. Can you process and provide back the samples?
|*File Name*|*Size*|*MD5*|
|test/GCBK.1014.MM_STMXT.14TH.TXT.pgp|2.89 Mb|cbdf912b55a61a951790d42394a1b4f9|

Per GCBK: "We need to review the NSF description changes on the DDA statements again. I sent over the below test files to the FTP (test folder). Are you able to run these and provide samples for review? "

Thanks!

comment: Hi [~Tevis Mak],

Please see following questions from GCBK:

"Sorry for the delayed response. We have identified some issues on the Fiserv side with regards to NSFs which has caused a temporary change in direction for this project until a resolution can be put in place.

How this impacts this project for the*PS_FAILED_PREAUTH*notices:

The $15 fee we had you map to indicate "Returned" in the table will be changing to $0.00 ** Currently a notice is not generating when it's zero so you will not see any in this file at this time. 

{color:#ff0000}Question:{color} Would it be easier to have you:
 # Change the $15.00 to $0.00 now & just do testing later once implemented on the Fiserv side
 # Leave the $15.00 logic in place knowing none will come over with that dollar amount, only the $32.00 at this time
 # Remove the $15.00 mapping altogether

We would submit a new ticket once Fiserv is able to include the zero-dollar fee notices in the file.

Secondly, the following appears incorrect on the latest samples if you could update this.

!image-2022-11-10-11-27-55-661.png!

I will send over a new file you can use for testing that does not have any $15.00 fee items for PS_FAILED_PREAUTH.

With the new information above, please let me know what the updated timeline would look like.

Thanks! Candace"

comment: Hi [~dyuen],

These are the updates applied on GCBKDL017:

    -     Updated the condition from $15 to $0, $15 is no longer applied for the program.
    -     Added logics for making the word "Return/Paid" in Italics.

Here is the sample with the newest update: 
 [^gcbkdla_PS_FAILED_PREAUTH_1111.pdf] 

Below is the sample for GCBKDL019 which no update is applied:
 [^gcbkdla_DP_MODSC.pdf]

author: dyuen
comment: Thanks Tevis. Updated samples forwarded to GCBK. Pending response.


author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~Tevis Mak], I finally have approval on the samples you provided in your last comment.

Per GCBK: "The PS_FAILED_PREAUTH changes have been reviewed and approved. The new target date is 11/23/22 for the first live production file."

Can you confirm 11/22 will work for code release? Since the 1st live file is coming in on 11/23. If yes, can you provide the test dpvs, etc for print samples and parallel?

Thanks

Please noted that per client comment #120 on TS30884, the condition of Returned/Paid change to $32 charge (Paid) and $0 charge (Returned) from $32 charge (Paid) and $15 charge (Returned). Also, there is no data file contains $0 fee notice yet. The sample only shows $32 fee notice for this time.

there is no endorsement on the print samples. should it be there?

please attach SOW.


author: dyuen
comment: [~berezinez], there is no endorsement on the letter because it's printed on the envelope.

On the print samples, the wordsReturned/Paid are not in Italics font as requested.

They don't match the approved samples.

please fix it, and request a new set of samples.
