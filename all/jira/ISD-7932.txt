comment: [~eric.yan] Can you take care of this? Enotice acct creation was apparently supposed to be enabled for all fcbt sub-cids at the time of their enotice setup, but looks like some cids were missed. We should just need to add it for the cids mentioned in the description, but please double check the rest of the sub-cids to make sure. Thanks

Somehow only prod is missing the createAccount flag, and it has all been added.
