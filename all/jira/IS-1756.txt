title: Correct TXT file to UNIX format
description: The issue was with the letter 52 txt file. DSI set up the format txt as DOS format while the rest of the letters are using UNIX format. The issue was when the txt for all letters were combined, they had DOS and UNIX line terminators and it caused the c1 file to be created incorrectly.



This was not caught during parallel because parallel was ran with only the new letter and should have been ran with other letters.



Issue has been fixed and successfully tested in parallel, please create a Jira so we can release fix.
