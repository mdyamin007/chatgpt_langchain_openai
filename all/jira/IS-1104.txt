comment: Hi [~nischala.manjunath] as discussed during turn over meeting please provide current specifications for below items from existing application as these details are missing in current SOW.
 # Print and eStatement Suppression
 # Grouping
 # PDF Archival
 # Message Manager
 # If we are currently generating Invalid Address Report



Thanks

comment: Hi [~ratnam] -
1) Print suppression is based on the data. If record 200, field 16 is set to Mail Code 91, 92, 520, 524, 591, 592, 97, 98 in the data, accounts are routed to non print (5.np1 - 5.np3, mail codes y, x, and w) except for account numbers '96479', '156645', '91563', '48355', '163165', '83114'. This has no eStatement set up.
2) No grouping
3) PDF Archival index file has these fields -filename|ACCOUNT_NUMBER|ACCOUNT_NAME|STMT_DATE|STMT_START|STMT_END|MEMBER_CLASS|FILE_TYPE
I'm not sure of the Individual pdf names, they look a little weird - sacume11088_fileCc15Wg.384.pdf.
The zip file is named sacume1_<mmddyyyy>.zip.
4) This has no message manager.
5) No invalid address report.

Thanks!

comment: Hi [~nischala.manjunath] , thanks for the help.



For # 3, is there a index file name in PDF Archival ? I only see index contents above.Also, Is theMEMBER_CLASS hardcoded or generated from data? IsSTMT_DATE system date or statement start date?



Looks like the PDF filename is as follows-



sacums11308_<system_generated_string>.<sequence#>.pdf

example: sacume11088_fileCc15Wg.384.pdf



Thanks

Thanks

author: nischala.manjunath
comment: [~ratnam] - Index file is named sacume1_<mmddyyyy>.txt.
STMT_DATE is the same as STMT_END date from the data. 
MEMBER_CLASS is from the data, record 200 field 16. Looks like it's what we use for print suppressions as well.
Thanks!

comment: Hi [~nischala.manjunath]SOW has been updated with print suppressions criteria and PDF Archival specifications. Please review and let me know if you have any questions.



Thanks

author: ratnam
comment: [~nischala.manjunath]can you confirm if the delimiter in index file is comma or pipe?

author: nischala.manjunath
comment: [~ratnam] - Got it, I'll use that file for samples. Do you have a new resource for eform though? Thanks!


author: ratnam
comment: [~kericapote]please review and respond to Nischala question above related to eform.



Thanks

author: kericapote
comment: [~nischala.manjunath]can you pull the eform from the previous program? IMP does not have access to any eforms.


author: nischala.manjunath
comment: [~kericapote] - per the mapping they want to make updates to the old one. They want to remove a field and change the verbiage for another field. It's not part of the code, I can't update it. It is part of the graphics/resource. Thanks!


author: nischala.manjunath
comment: [~kericapote] [~ratnam] - Sample is attached. [^sacume2.pdf] 
The mapping says to remove "Over Limit Amount" and to update "Loan Type" to "Loan ID". These are part of the graphics and I will need a new resource/eform pdf to make this update.
Please note that I used the current eform in production to showcase what the statement will look when printed. Will need to update once we have the new resource.
Thanks!

The story is already more than one week late. It should be in QA as per the original agreement  07.22.2022. With all that said, I can't guarantee the finished testing. Please let's discuss the new timeline

comment: [~Igor.Khosid] this needs to be live 8/5 for the production file that comes 8/8. Can you have QA done by 8/3 or 8/4 so I can parallel? I may need to do a 1 day parallel on 8/4 because production is running month end then. Let me know. Thanks!

comment: [~nischala.manjunath] [~kericapote] Print suppression logic has been updated in SOW based on logic update recieved from the CU via ticket#32860

a) If record 200, field 01 field exists within account data and value is either 1, 2, or 99 then suppress from print and mail. In this case, do not look for Record 200 Field 23. Include these statements in PDF Archival.

b) Record 200 field 01 does not exists and Record 200 field 23 value is 0 or 2 then print and mail. Include these statements in PDF Archival.

*+*Important Note:*+Per confirmation received from the CU, If Record 200 field 23+do not+exists within account data, then consider the field having a value of 0 and proceed with print and mail.

c) If Record 200 field 01 does not exists and the Record 200 field 23 value is 1. It is an e-statement. Suppress from print and mail. Include these statements in PDF Archival.



Thanks
