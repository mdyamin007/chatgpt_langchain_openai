There is basically no change per coding except I updated the script*fcbtdla_process*.sh. to call*update_daily_insert*.sh instead of*update_stmt_insert.sh* .



All I needed to check if there is e.sup entry in dpvs if I add paperless file in insert file. Today I ran for some sub cid. You can check:

/z/daily/plba/plbadla128.print

/z/daily/cafc/cafcdla128.print

/z/daily/alfc/alfcdla128.print

/z/daily/fcba/fcbadla128.print

to see e.sup entry.

Although there are other cids to check, I don't have data files for all those, but I am assuring you that this update doesn't need any change in coding . If Dp adds a paperless file in the insert file the e.sup entry will appear automatically.



Thanks,

Rony
