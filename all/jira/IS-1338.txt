I changed the IMB type to ESR1 for test and parallel database. But not production.

comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid]

The update was to add return mail processing ( Electronic server requested ) for the below application:

MVCU CD Maturity Daily Notices (mvcudla)

Pay My Loan Letter (mvcudlb)

Business Loan Statements (mvcuml4)

DDA/Monthly Statements (mvcums3)

FICS Mortgage Statements (PDF Data) (mvcuml3.control) - redtitan job *onshore need to do this*

Among those except FICS Mortgage, we updated the rest 4. *The FICS Mortgage needs to be done onshore.*

Please check the pilot jobs status tab for the below apps, to look into pdfs to see the Electronic Service Requested verbiage.

comment: Hi [~rony]

Thanks for the detailed info. 
We were able to check CD, Invoice and Pay My Loan applications and they look fine.
However, we could not see any of the statements (Stmt - Keystone Stmt). They all show "PDF is missing or corrupted" message.
!missingcorrupt.png!
As far as I can see the server sends an empty response (while status is 200). (We tried Edge, Chrome and FF, just in case.)

We need to see these statements.
Thank you

Checked the statements. Electronic Service Requested is there, all looks good.

comment: Hi [~Ricky Lopez]

I think it's time to check with the client now and get their approval.

no records are appearing in the pilot site jobs status tab. Would it be possible to help to find the reason?

The triggering from our side returns success:

author: phoebe.george
comment: [~anil.dasa] Can you provide an update on this?

[~rony] [~Tasneem] While this issue for displaying on pilot site is addressed, please just provide PDF samples in the meantime. We need to get MVCU approval on the samples with the new endorsement line of : Electronic Service Requested

We'll send to MVCU separately so we can get final approvals to move forward
