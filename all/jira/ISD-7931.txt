comment: Hi [~Tin.Chak], I assigned the Jira story to you since I didn't see a programmer/developer in your assessment.

Thanks!

comment: [~billr] I noticed the SOW lists new letter 'Proof of Insurance Request' tied to new letter code 019, however on production I see 019 already exists with description 'Holiday Check'. I don't see any enotices in our prod database for 019 yet though, so I'm wondering if I can update that description. Can you confirm?

Shun, I will ask IS.

Shun, see Rony's response on IS-1675 - ok to use 019.


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: Thanks [~billr], I'll update the description on production once we're ready to go live.

comment: Hi [~Shun.Kuwashima], FYI [~misbah.uddin@dsinnovators.com]made a minor change to include a "Return Service Requested" verbiage on the letter. Everything else stays the same though

Electronic ticket #35481 has been created.

Thanks!

comment: Thanks [~dyuen], I'll look out for that during parallel. Everything is still the same in terms of ISD updates, so that is still good as planned.
