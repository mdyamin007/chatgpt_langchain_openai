It is on pilot for client review.

I have triggered bounced emails on the following accounts and ran Bounceback report.  The accounts did not switch to paper and emails remain valid.

comment: Thank you [~lina]. Can you tell me if we need to QA and parallel test? This must be rolled out with impl-1905.

comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com],

This task should go through QA.

This task by itself does not require parallel.

However, I think there should be a ISD parallel task to verify that IS is generating enrollment files correctly and they are being processed by ISD.  I do not see this task.

comment: [~lina]- What do you need me to do to get a ISD parallel task? Like a parallel ticket but it's for ISD?

Yes, a parallel ticket for ISD so that it will get assigned and can plan for it.

Can you add hours to this task?

Thanks.

comment: Done [~lina]. We'll need to run the test when we roll out IMPL-1905. I'll let you know when we run that test.

In the mean time, can we get the client review and approve "Bounceback Process update request"?  The client can review accounts provided on 04/15 to make sure those accounts are still enrolled and bounded email address on them is not invalidated.

Or should I just skip client approval and go for QA?

Regards.

This is ready for QA.

Step1:  Verify that the following accounts are enrolled in electronic on InfoTRAC.
12345
76423
85492
88776
101226

Step 2:  After step 1 verification, please let me know.  I will trigger a Bounceback report.  The report should not switch accounts from step 1 to paper.

Step 3.:  Verify the accounts from step 1 that they are still on electronic.

Thanks.
