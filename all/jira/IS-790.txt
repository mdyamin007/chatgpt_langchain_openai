description: 1. BBBBYTAX.dfa : Update mail code to 's' if address block contains "Bad Address"
 BBBB IRA/HSA:
 2. BBBBYL001.dfa + BBBBYL002.dfa : Update mail code to 's' if address block contains "DO NOT MAIL", "BAD ADDRESS" and
 "HOLD MAIL".

----------------per Yamee------------------------------

Timeline:

Turnover to IS 2/1/22

Samples to QA 2/8/22

LIVE date 2/10/22



bypass parallel and no need for sample approval (unless client wants it then let us know).



We will need to create invert lists for each of the tax form and reprocess as segment 2. I will create the invert lists once QA passes.

Please request laser samples for the rt2 files. The pdfs are in the attachments. Do the clients want sample approval? If not, then after qa, we should be good to release code.

The client says we should have non print files that were in the 1099I. Please provide samples for those as well.
