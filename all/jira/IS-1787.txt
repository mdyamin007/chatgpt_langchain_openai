comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid]

Parallel id: 20221103232107

MFCUMS11.zip is in qa folder.



The requirement was if any standalone 410 ( meaning the 410 that doesn't appear between 430 and 439 ) has

Draft: Withdrawal Ret Item or ACH: Withdrawal Return Item then we need to show the description. And also need to add the description immediately below 410 appended to the previous 410 descriptions. Also need to show the date and per client, the monetary values can be 0.00.



For example:

!image-2022-11-08-00-06-21-982.png|width=880,height=431!

You see line 60 the 410 records is not inside the 430 and 439 record which is normal behavior. We treat 430 as the main transaction and 410 as a subtransaction if 410 appears inside the 430->439 block and append the description of 410 ( field 03 to the 430 descriptions).



But now the client wanted that if standalone 410 contains Draft: Withdrawal Ret Item or ACH: Withdrawal Return Item then we need to show the description. And also need to add the description immediately below 410 appended to the previous 410 descriptions.



And if you look at the current output after the update:

!image-2022-11-08-00-11-28-354.png!



The project I uploaded has the data file client provided in the team supporthttps://app.na3.teamsupport.com/?TicketNumber=35558 comment 1.

And the snap shot I provided is from 1st customer.

As I understand the description, the app behaves correctly.

I notice that for the second record 410 after 410 "Draft..." record, the description is not shown: only for the first one.

I mean:
 439`
 410~0110062022~0210062022~03Draft: Withdrawal Ret Item 1025`
 410~0110062022~0210062022~03This is the first line~041`
 410~0110062022~0210062022~03And this is the second line~041`

the first line is displayed, but not the second.

This conforms with "immediately below 410" words in the requirement, but maybe you should check with the client if only one line should be treated as a description: what if they may require more lines?

comment: Hi [~avannik]

That's intelligent thinking and looks like the client agreed with your comment that 410 can appear multiple times. I updated the program. MFCUMS11.zip is in qa folder. Parallel id same as previous:20221103232107

Forgot to add client also wanted monetary values to be empty 2nd and 3rd columns.



[~dyuen]

comment: [~rony]thanks - yes, that makes sense.


author: JIRAUSER11700
comment: [~rony] [~dyuen]I checked the updated version: it looks good.

comment: Thank you [~rony] [~avannik], I notified MFCU that these updates have been made. Still pending approval on the samples.




author: dyuen
comment: [~rony] [~avannik], we are OK to proceed with parallel. Please provide paperwork ASAP so that I can get parallel started.

Per MFCU: "this is approved to run a test in parallel. Once in parallel i can approve those samples."

We will also need to provide samples from parallel for MFCU to review.

Thanks

comment: Hi [~TunA]per our conversation, I created MPT #35800.

[~avannik] [~rony]to get this done as quickly as possible I spoke with Tun. Tun will help fill out the IS checklist so that it can be attached to MPT. We'll let DP start the parallel process and once completed on their end, Rony/Tun will generate a PDF sample file with the accounts from my last comment/comment above.

DP will be instructed to use the October production file for parallel testing.

[~Igor.Khosid]FYI

Thanks!
