comment: The client want the default paperless option to be 'E' for the enrollment process. Is that the case right now?

I believe because the paperless status is already present for the users in non-prod environment its displaying their current status. Will new users going through enrollment be defaulted to 'E'. 



can we configure to default to paperless during enrollment.

comment: [~Michael.Holden]  I believe the default is already paperless for the enrollment. However we would verify that and let you know. [~dipak.mondal]  can you help investigate that tomorrow as Arefin is on leave.
