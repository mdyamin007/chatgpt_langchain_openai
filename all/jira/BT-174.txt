Should the value be "April"?

Hi [~Shun.Kuwashima]can you help with this issue?

comment: Hi [~tohidulI]
Also, the title should contain name "eNotices" and not "Statement"

comment: [~golam.azrin] This is the same issue as in BT-178, but on infotrac. Can you take a look?

comment: [~phoebe.george] [~Igor.Khosid] [~Andrey.Kutsenko] For both BT-174 and BT-178, this does not affect the actual content of the enotice nor the enotice date and description shown on the sites, plus the client already approved on pilot. I discussed with my team and we think it should be fine to close out these bug tickets and address this at a later time so that it does not hold up the rest of the project (phoebe, please confirm a new live date if possible). If you think otherwise, please escalate to Sean/David to discuss further. Thanks
