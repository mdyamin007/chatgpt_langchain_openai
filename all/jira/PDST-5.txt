comment: [~yameelee]:  For Item #1, i don't have enough details to be able to troubleshoot and may need to add additional troubleshooting logic in job_list2 script. Can test this on the "old" rht to see if this error also occurs on the original RHT box as well.



Item #2 will need to be address by me to reach out to ISD to see why; But I'm speculating it is just a bad value issue.. At least it reached out to ISD system.



Item #3 will hopefully be addressed when we create a afp2web processing for Dev environment. Looks like we do not have a test environment for PDF archival.
