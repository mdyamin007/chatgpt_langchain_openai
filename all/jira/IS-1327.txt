1. Please use the logo that is being used for the existing daily letters for ALL letters in this setup. The logo that you currently have has "First Financial Bank" beneath it. It needs to be removed. The daily letter logo does not have this.

2. FFINDL321 - Remove the line in the screenshot.

3. FFINDL322 - Remove the line in the screenshot.

4. FFINDL325 - Please replace the backer with the one attached.

5. FFINDL330 - Align the 2 lines under the asterisk to justify with the line above.

Which Line you want to get removed from letter 321 and 322. I don't see any screenshot regarding that.
Please provide us the screenshot again.
Thanks.

FFINDL321  Otherwise, simply stop by one of our banking centers to open your Christmas Club account for next year.

Should have this line removed.



FFINDL322  Otherwise, simplystop by one of our banking centers to open your Vacation Club account for next year.

These are the samples from letter code 337-342. Please have a look. 
And, ss I commented before that we need multipaged datafile to catch the second page's information. So, please send us the multi-paged datafile for letter 343. 

Thanks

1. I'm missing samples for FFIN DL 331-336. The logo needs to be updated. Please advise.

2. The backer for FFIN DL 325 has not been updated. Here it is again. Can you please update?

comment: [~mousumiS] [~fahad]- Feedback on ALL letters. Please see attached. Number next to address needs to be right beside it and show through window. On latest samples, it was moved to the middle of the page.

The return department can also be viewed from window still now. But if you want to change the position, we can do it. Please suggest. 

Thanks 
Sumi


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~mousumiS]- Understood. Please change the position. The bank really needs this right by the address. It's probably where their people are used to seeing. Moving it would be cumbersome. Thx.

comment: [~fahad]- Per FFIN...



LN0395-56 /FFINDL334 - this notice is incorrect The sample that was returned for 56 is actually LN0395-053 (FFINDL333)

Ln0395-020/FFINDL325 & FFINDL326 (HUD) Backer still needs the expiration date on the header that way we can identify which version Is being used.

comment: [~fahad]- I don't see the exp date for sample letter 326.

comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com],
For the Backer of letter 326 the exp date is 3/31/2021
!image-2022-10-28-04-05-14-513.png!

As currently we are in 2022, so it didn't make sense to me. that's why I removed it. If you want it back again.. Here's the sample attached with the exp date.
Thanks.
