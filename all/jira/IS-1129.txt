see the response below from the team.  There is a request to remove the "-" symbol from in from of the amount and provide specific examples that would have data in the new field. Thank you!



The From Loan is the only one in the examples that I can see that has fees assessed. I think the placement looks great, but is there any way that we could get the number to not report as a negative? Especially with it being so close to the late fee balance, I can see how a member might think that its a credit instead of their balance due:

 




If theyre able to make that change, could we get examples for the members below?

Thank you, I have sent the new samples over.  The client is out of office until Wednesday, so we will not get approval before then.

Please see client's question below.

They look really good! All the info matches, hurray!!  One question, the statement on pg. 15 for Michael Peck is for May, and all the others are for June, is that just because they are testing from more than one sample file?
