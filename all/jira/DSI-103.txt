title: RWCU eStatement Error
description: The client is reporting that some customers are seeing the error in the attached image. I can't seem to be able to find an error message anywhere in the code that would display that. Please help research.



They also reported that cif_num0000177900 logged on around 8:18 am PST on 9/5/2019 and got the same error. I checked the logs, and it seemed like this account logged on around that time multiple times. But again, I couldn't find any error in the logs. If you think this is a good lead, please review the logs again and see if you can find anything.

comment: !rwcu_estmt_error.png!!estmt_error.png! Based on the error message in the attached image, I'm able to reproduce the error. This can be reproduced if

1.inside properties.json of RWCU the value of *"link": "?page=eStatement"* inside 'menu' json is not set to exactly same as this "link": "?page=eStatement". 

2.in "*eStatement.htm*l" , *<template name="eStatement">* this "'name" attribute is set to something else, if this is the case then it's severity is so high cause this will affect all the client and none of them will be able to see eStatement page but the error.

*however, when I run the code from the trunk without changing anything I couldn't produce the bug.*

Thank you. I checked the Production tag and it seems like the names are correct. And yes, if the names were indeed mismatched, it should be affecting all clients, which it is not.



I will ask the client for more information.



In the meantime, I will leave this ticket open in case I need your help again.



Thanks,

Tai
