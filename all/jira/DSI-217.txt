title: WECU Pre-Enrollment File Parsing
description: as per Bryant's Email:



We need to create a pre-enrollment .txt file with the header:*CIF|User Type|Account Number|Account Type|Name|E-Mail Address|Account Delivery Preference*



This is how you will take each field from reading information from both the files:



+IF COLUMN 8 IS N IN THE*EDD Enrollment.xlsx*FILE, SKIP THAT RECORD.+

++
 # CIF
 ## Get the CIF number by checking for the*account number, first name, and last name*from the CIF file for each record in the*EDD Enrollment.xlsx*
 # User Type
 ## This is for if they are personal account or business account
 ## for each*account number*in the*EDD Enrollment.xlsx*get the*customer type(4^th^column)*from the CIF file
 ## If the value in the CIF file is P then use*P*. If it is an O, use*N*
 # Account Number
 ## Get the account number from every record in the*EDD Enrollment.xlsx (6^th^column)*
 # Account Type
 ## Get the account Type from every record in the*EDD Enrollment.xlsx (5^th^column)*
 ## I will get back to you on the account type mappings for Loan Statements
 ### *Checking Statement = DD*
 ### *Saving Statement = SV*
 ### *Time Statement = TD*
 ### *Visa Statement = CC*
 ### *I will get back to you on Loan Statements and Tax Statements*

 # Name
 ## Get the Name from every record in the*EDD Enrollment.xlsx*using first+last name (columns 3 and 4)
 # Email Address
 ## Get the Email from every record in the*EDD Enrollment.xlsx*(column 2)
 # Account Delivery Preference
 ## Get the Delivery Preference from every record in the*EDD Enrollment.xlsx*(column 8) MUST BE Y
 ## If the column is Y, use E in the pre-enrollment file.

comment: hi [~Bryant.Tran] Ihave some confusion regarding Pre Enrollment file parsing
 * what will be the account type for Loan and Tax Statements
 * Some entries in the CIF file is missing the CIF number, what should I do for those entires?
 * There are so many identical entries in the CIF file. for example, if you search this account number (36315610104) for this you will find 5 entries where 1 is missing CIF, and among other 4 there are 2 identical pairs
 * Some account number in the EDD enrollment.xlsx doesn't have any entry in the CIF file, for example : 15885034500,40058558 . so what should i do for those?
 * You said to search with account Num, first Name and Last Name, But no Acct Type, so i assume they don't have any overlapping account number. Am I right?
