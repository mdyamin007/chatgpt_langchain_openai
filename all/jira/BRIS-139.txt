title: Temporary:  mailer-instant.infoimageinc.com
description: [~kent.chan]: Per our Brisbane meeting today. We need to setup a temporary email server while Ferhat works on the fresh install.

There are two options you are debating with the approach:



#1.  Setup a simple SMTP server

#2. Clone the existing mailer-instant.infoimageinc.com server.



Please note. Do {color:#de350b}*NOT*{color} update the mailer-instant.infoimageinc.com or update mailer_svr server IP address in the current DNS. We need to leave this alone to still use Menlo IP address. Our code references mailer-instant.infoimageinc.com.
