*1. Did not understand the difference between both dates (MMDDYYYY). Can you please specify more?*

!image-2022-04-19-10-29-58-961.png|width=370,height=168!

*2.**For monthly should the condition be this: Each zipped file to contain 5,000 PDF's per batch.*

*or this:Generate individual PDFs in zipped batches less than 1 Gbytes file size each.*

*As both are mentioned above we wanted to confirm.*



Thanks

Please let us know regarding the above queries.

comment: [~Najoa] sorry I missed this!
 # I'll update the specs, the first is the cycle date (not processing date). This should match the customer file name date stamp. The seoncd date is the Processing Timestamp (the date that the PDF archival file is processed/generated. I'll update the description accordingly.
 # It should be batches of 5,000. I'll eliminate the second option based on file sizes.

Thanks,

Phoebe

Provided the project again in this path/d/iss/qa/SUCU/  filename: SUCUMS11.zip

Please have a look and let us know if there is any issue

Sounds much better now. Please update the status on BT-40 to fixed. Also, please leave their comments on what you did to fix the issue

QA is completed, please attach IS checklist if needed.

Please put due date for 7/12/22. Thanks!

author: tanmay
comment: [~phoebe.george] since these one archival setup and no change in design i guess we dont need parallel testing. So i am preparing for code release.

[~TunA] Transfer form( [^IS_PROGRAM_TRANSFER_FORM_IS-1019.doc] ) has been attached and updated files has been placed at /d/is/cvs/xfer/mahbuburT

[~phoebe.george] if you still need parallel testing let me know

comment: [~tanmay] Sorry, we have an issue reported by SUCU. They are having issues with decrypting all of our files that use the PGP key. This is for all applications.

How difficult is it to remove the PGP encryption, and just use the .zip for generating the files for copying to client pickup? Please let me know if this update can be made before code release.

Thanks!


author: tanmay
comment: [~phoebe.george] we have removed PGP encryption. Please go for code release . updated files in xfer folder 


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~tanmay] We actually completed test processing separately with DP from the parallel environment already, even though it was not tied to the MPT. It ran successfully and we copied those files to SUCU. That is how they determined that the PGP files could not be decrypted on their end. 

[~TunA] When possible, can you complete code release tied to Tanmay's previous comment with the Transform form attached?



Thanks!

Following codes have been released.
