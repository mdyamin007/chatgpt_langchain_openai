title: MFCU - TS26478 Mortgage Update to center body of eStatement pdf
description: We want to center the statement on the PDFs in eStatements. On print because of the bardcoding on the left margin, the body of the statement is pushed to the right. In eStatements we want the body center on the PDF.



In addition, please setup FTP Trigger to automate the process when this file arrives.

I tried the FTP auto trigger in PARALLEL and the file picked up but did not process.

Do you need to enable/active or anything on your end?

This is for the MFCU Mortgage.

Can you test again?

Yes, ISD needs to make configuration updates for the scanner to expect file names.

I've added the file name for mortgage. Let me know if it works.
