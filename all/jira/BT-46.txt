Below is the comment from Rukmani
212  acct#150016836901 (it's mail only and is suppress for e-notice. You can test with this account number)

205 and 214 are also suppressed for e-notice but they are not in any of the recent data files. I tested 214 for suppression in one of the old files.

213 is not in this data file.

[~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]--If 213 sample is not available ,then I will pass this ticket with notes
