comment: Hi [~andyp],

I reviewed this with the client today.

Looks like we're missing some masking. I've reattached the samples you provided and circled the account numbers that still require masking.

comment: [~andyp], I've attached a data file the client just provided. If this isn't what you're looking for I may need to set up a call so you can better explain what you're needing.
