comment: Hi [~rukmaniR], I've uploaded the resource files and posted the index file onto pilot. Based on the sample names, it seems like I should be trying to compare the output for letter 009, 018, and 050, however I don't see those letters in the index file. Should these three letters be in the index file or should I be checking other letter types?


author: JIRAUSER11100
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] Please check for letter 011, 013, 015, 016, 017 and 020 too. I'll check the index file.

Thanks!

comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] Looks like 009, 018 and 050 are suppressed for e-notice. Please check 001 too.

Thanks!

comment: [~rukmaniR], I'm not seeing letters 015, 016, 017 and 020 in the index file. I was able to check letters 001, 011 and 013, those look good so far and I can see the signature that Gnana mentioned prior to the resource upload.

comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] Letters 015, 016, 017 and 020 are also suppressed. Thanks for your help!

comment: No prob, thanks [~rukmaniR]!

comment: [~barnetts], since there's no parallel and resources are already uploaded to all our servers, there's nothing else needed from ISD. Closing out this story.
