comment: [~kdishroon] this is ready for review on pilot. Please have the client check all 24 accounts (23 fnbt and 1 fhnb). Let me know if there's any adjustments that need to be made.

comment: Hi [~Shun.Kuwashima],

Here is the client's feedback:

*"I found a couple of issues. In FNBT- the FHNB notice for 73431753 is indexed under 73431754. In FNBT - notice for 73431717 is indexed under 73441417. I am sure this is because the account number in the file name is incorrect. I have corrected the name of the file and attached it.*

*No issues with the one FHNB notice in the FHNB admin site."*
