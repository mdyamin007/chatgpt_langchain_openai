title: MFCU - [26940] [pvt] Daily Letters 22, 44, 71 and 83 - Update Enclosures perm solution - Live 4/29
description: Request from client:

We have three items that periodically need to update InfoImage: branch manager signatures, rate sheet and fee schedule.  The rate sheet and fee scheduled are on a predictable schedule like weekly and monthly where as the branch manager signatures can come at any time depending on staffing changes.  

Is there an automated way we can do it, even for the rate sheet or free schedule that are predictable?  The issue there is the rate sheet isnt finalized until like 2 to 3 days prior to month end sometimes.  There is very little lead time.

comment: [~anwarh] - Client requests to print the rate and fee schedule on 1 sheet of paper so Rate Sheet prints on back of Fee Schedule. Please provide new small samples for approval and add them to this ticket if possible.

comment: [~Igor.Khosid]  - I believe the test data was from March so it makes sense the insertst are dated for March. Client has already approved these samples so we can move forward to complete QA.
