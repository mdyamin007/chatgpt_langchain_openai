title: GCBK - [34112][pvt][in-house] Deposit Collection Files (26, 27, 28 & 29th Cycles)
description: Once IS finishes making updates, we will need to transfer all letters 023 and 024 from the acct type 99 to the other account's respective type (Most of them are DD, there are a handful of SV). If accounts have both an SV and DD type, move it to DD. Below are the initial number of accts with an SV and DD, might be more after IS makes their update since these letters are daily:

19070836718
 709386
 3080352898
 3080432116
 185918
 2584415
 3070855932
 3080399262
 6080347774

Before transferring, let's double check first that none of the 023/024 letters have been viewed and that none of the type 99 accts are tied to any users.



Per ticket #34112, comment 39 and 40:

Hello!

Even though we just spoke, I figured I'd still respond so you have it in the ticket for reference if needed.

For both letters -

If an Account on the arch_ref file has CK > Map to DD
 If an Account on the arch_ref file has SAV > Map to SV

I believe the 99 comes in when you can't find the account number on the arch-ref file, so those would be handled how you do any others today when this occurs.



Or I guess I didn't ask, for those that had a 99, if they later were on the file so following letters identified the account as SV or DD, if you can then transfer it to the correct type that would be great. Maybe that question was for the going back to post these after the fact.

Thanks! Candace
