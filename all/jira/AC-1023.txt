title: EWBB - [32690][pvt][in-house] Tax software update to Crawford (inhs)
description: Here are the testing result with Crawford:



1. With Crawford, the big PDF file doesn't need to be split and a EWBB PDF file with 308MB took ~4 hours to process. With Redtitan, a big PDF file need to be split to around 40mb-50mb per file and takes ~1 hour to process each small file.

2. EWBB on Crawford takes longer to process because there is a backer image that takes up a lot of size and the LZW compression had to to be turned on.
