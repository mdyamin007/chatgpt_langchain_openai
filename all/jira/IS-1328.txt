Will there be a sample report for the client to approve as well?


author: JIRAUSER10911
comment: *Items to note
 * Will need client Return mail address.
 * Endorsement will need to be placed on document, not envelope
 ** Client will need to confirm approval
 * There will be 2 endorsements
 ** Electronic Service Requested for all files that have an IMB (typically 4. files)
 ** Return Service Requested for all files that do not have an IMB (typically 5. files) - (this return mail will be shipped back to address from 1st bullet point)
 * New Report generated will have more information/ but slightly different



MID below:

902668060  current MID

902236245 -new MID



The New MID will be for any application utilizing the ACS.



WECU has been added to ACS and Informed Visibility Services for when applicable. Please use STID 522.

comment: Hi [~Kbittmann]

I am not familiar with the report request, in your previous message.

_Will there be a sample report for the client to approve as well?_

Hi [~jira_naru]I believe you helped assess this task, would it be possible to advise here about the report thing? Please see the previous 2 comments from [~Kbittmann]

For *wecudlb*,
 updated resources *wecudlb.control*, *wecudlb_process.sh* are kept in both development and parallel.

Development ID :*20220823231549*

Can we request DP to run this redtitan job ?

Thanks!

As Dp run *wecudlb* in parallel,

Here is the sample :*/d/ac-secure-share/ac/kris/IS-1328/wecudlb1104.2o1.pdf*

comment: [~rumanb]

Please confirm you have updated the STID to 522. I am also confirming the return address for WECU with the client.


author: JIRAUSER10912
comment: Hi [~Kbittmann] 

I updated the control file for STID to 522.
Is there any feedback from client ?

Thanks!

Please update the return mail address to the below:

WECU

PO BOX 9750

BELLINGHAM, WA 98227


author: JIRAUSER10912
comment: Hi [~Kbittmann] 

The apps *wecuaa1*, *wecudla*, *wecudlb*, *wecuml1*, *wecumv1*, *wecums1* , all are using same logo and the logo contains return mail address of the bank.
Can you please provide me the new logo with new return mail address ?

Thanks!


author: JIRAUSER10911
comment: [~rumanb]

I provided the return address in the last comment. The logo should be the same as the samples you provided. Are you needing the artwork for the logo?


author: JIRAUSER10912
comment: Hi [~Kbittmann] 

Please look at the screenshot below,

!return_address.png|thumbnail!

This is the logo of existing projects. So I need such a logo which has the updated/recent return address inside it.
Can you provide me such a tiff/pseg which has both bank logo and return mail address ?

Thanks!


author: JIRAUSER10911
comment: [~rumanb]

Does the logo tiff need to be a specific size?


author: JIRAUSER10912
comment: Hi [~Kbittmann] 

The existing logo has a dimension of *width = 2.1 inch* , *height = 0.59 inch.*

If you provide me the logo according to that dimensions , it will be convenient for me.
If the logo is bigger than these 2 dimensions then I will have to resize it to use.

Thanks!


author: JIRAUSER10911
comment: [~rumanb]

Client provided the attached logos. One is for black and white and the other is for color.


author: JIRAUSER10911
comment: [~rumanb]

The attachments are showing corrupted. Please review team support ticket 29498 comment 43 for attachments.


author: JIRAUSER10912
comment: Hi [~Kbittmann]

I reviewed *TS-29498* , Client provided 2 logos but the quality of two logos isn't clear enough.
 Return address isn't obvious at all in both of them.

Can we request client for better quality tiff to provide us or Should we use these 2 logos that client already provided ?

Thanks!


author: JIRAUSER10912
comment: Hi [~Kbittmann]

Here is the resolution and other properties of previous logo

!logo.png!

Can we request client for logo of 300 resolution ?
 Thanks!


author: JIRAUSER10911
comment: [~rumanb]

I've requested updated logos from the client.


author: JIRAUSER10912

Thanks!

No new updates from the client yet. I have followed up with them again.

1. Please update the due date
2. Due to the lack of QA resources, and the EOM, I suggest the end of the next week.

Moved due date to 11/10.


author: JIRAUSER10912
comment: [~Kbittmann]Thanks

According to *TS-29965*, In comment no #30, DP confirmed that *wecudlb* process is also complete.

So I placed the Sample of wecudlb in this path */d/ac-secure-share/ac/kris/IS-1328/wecudlb1264.2o1.pdf*.


author: JIRAUSER11700
comment: [~rumanb] [~Kbittmann]

Alright, I checked that mail server ASE3 is changed to ESR1, newcourse logic commented out, logos with addresses in applications are changed to the new ones.

Please check the bug about address lines locations in detachable coupons.


author: JIRAUSER10912
comment: [~avannik] 

There is no barcode in production code of *wecuml1*, *wecumv1*, *wecums1*.
According to this update request from client, *ts-29965*, comment no *#2* , implementing barcode wasn't included in the requirements of this update request.

[~Kbittmann]Can you advise here ?


author: JIRAUSER11700
comment: Based on feedback from Kris and Andrea, the recipients are supposed to mail coupons in their own envelopes. So there is no envelope and no barcodes.

QA finished.


author: JIRAUSER10912

As QA is completed, Should we go for code release or create a parallel form for parallel testing ?
