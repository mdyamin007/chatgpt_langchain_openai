title: Clarify endorsement requirements in SOW

We use 4406 envelope --there's neither #10 nor custom preprinted envelope involved.

Endorsement line is only required for presorted mail, not full first class mail.

Since all the 9x12s are going out at full first class, no endorsement is needed

I understand. I don't want to carp, but when I read this section in SOW, it makes me pause in confusion.
It could simply read like this:
{quote}*9.0 USPS Endorsement*

No endorsement is required.
{quote}
Why not keep business documents concise and unambiguous?
