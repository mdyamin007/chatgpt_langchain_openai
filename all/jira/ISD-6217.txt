title: Consolidate Accounting Reports - Planning
description: Consolidate all clients into DefaultReport.

For features that can't be dynamically determined by process, add accounting config, similar to the popUpAlert report.

Consolidate clients one-by-one, so we can make changes week by week.

Please look into RWCU's double "Document Processing" report issue.

comment: [~mac]

For SANA report, the "E-Notices" table is displayed as "Document Processing" table.

For SFCE, afp processing is no longer used.

For SNFB, I drop "Fax Report" since no longer in use.

"Promotional Notification" is not showing up in the new report, I don't find any keyword to incorporate the report.

tkcu.conf has "doc" in dev env vs prod has "afp".

We need to QA this on staging.

We are going to compare the latest reports for each of these clients.

The first 10 CIDs:
 * ACBK
 * AGAL
 * AGFC
 * AGNM
 * ALCU
 * ALFC
 * APCU
 * ASFC
 * BANB
 * BBBB



Steps: (Do this on both Stage and Prod)
 # Access the PUI page on both prod and stage.
 # Press [Processing Report], it is located at the top of the page.
 # Select the CID, the CID to choose is mentioned in the list above.
 # Leave the*Stmt. Cycle:***as it is.
 # Press Submit. A report will show up.
 # Now we are going to compare the report that is on staging and production. We want to make sure the two reports match up in terms of the tables, and text shown. The ordering isn't important. Prod report will show actual data in the tables where as staging won't because the report is based on jobs ran.



NOTE: There are some tables that will not be necessary such as *Promotional Notification*

author: JIRAUSER10913
comment: PRODUCTION: CAMB has both doc and enotice4. However, they post their eNotices with enotice4, and having both these processing steps is causing issues with the eNotices reporting.

We need to QA this on staging.

We are going to compare the reports from staging vs the reports on production.
 * EWBB
 * GDCU
 * GECU
 * HEBC
 * IDCU
 * KFCU
 * KYCU
 * MOCU
 * MPCU
 * MSBK
 * MVCU
 * MWCU
 * NVCU
 * PPCU
 * PROV
 * RWCU
 * SANA
 * SFCE
 * SNFB
 * SPCU
 * SSCU
 * TKCU
 * VWCU
 * WHCU
 * WTCU

Steps: (Do this on both Stage and Prod)
 # Access the PUI page on both prod and stage.
 # Press[Processing Report], it is located at the top of the page.
 # Select the CID, the CID to choose is mentioned in the list above.
 # Leave the*Stmt. Cycle:***as it is.

NOTE: There are some tables that will not be necessary such as*Promotional Notification, XML*. If the report on staging has a few extra information on the report, that is okay as long as the report on staging has everything that production currently has.
