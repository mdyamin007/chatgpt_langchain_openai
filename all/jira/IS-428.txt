Kris,

Samples are attached.

They can ignore the blank page since this prints duplex.

BANB provided the below feedback on the samples provided.

Although hard to spot but it appears there is a space between the y and the s on "weekday{color:#ff0000}s "{color}

Also, it was asked if we could add a blank line in between the message and the address at the bottom. Final request is if we can *BOLD* the additional verbiage we added.

Hi Igor,

We don't need print samples since we're only adding verbiage at bottom of notice.

Thanks.
