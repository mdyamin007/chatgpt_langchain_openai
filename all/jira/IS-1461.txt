title: RWCU - Stmt - Billing PDFi Conversion to AFP2PDF Python [InHse]
description: Update existing processing script to no longer use PDFi tool to create pdf.
 Instead use afp2pdf.py program with index_build_multicore option for ALL statement related apps.
 The smaller daily notice jobs can use the current index_build options.

All the zip file, pgp encryption, index file contents, and PDF file naming convention must remain exactly the same original specifications.

Please ensure the standard SOP on the directory structure must be followed: 
 ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/pdf, ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/zip, ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/work is followed.
 Also, clear the folder directory folder before each processing. We do NOT want to accumulate previous runs.

The current program should support checking total PDF counts verification to make sure the expected pdf matches the total number for pdfs generated; If not, incorporate this standard verification logic

DT_JOB_ID:

Processing Scripts to modify:
rwcu_mortgage_process.sh

Data Files to use:



*NOTE*: This job runs on RH2. Since we are migrating from RHS to RH2, we should test all options so that we can do afpcompare and also ensure there is no errors in the processing logs.

Data files:
/z/dsi_pdfi_testing/rwcuml3/data/RWCU_Billing_09182022.asc 
/z/dsi_pdfi_testing/rwcuml3/data/RWCU_Billing_Count_09182022.asc

old zips: /z/dsi_pdfi_testing/rwcuml3/old/
new zips: /z/dsi_pdfi_testing/rwcuml3/new/

Notes: 
- Index file (XML format) contents is out of order
- index file is splited based on the number of zips so the content will be different from the prod version
- But the index file will have correct pdf names/content corresponding to its zip

Thanks,
Anwar

/d/pdf_compare/rwcuml3_prod

/d/pdf_compare/rwcuml3_parallel



Please note the comments from Anwar above. Thanks!

comment: Hi [~William.Kong],
Based on our conversation in the Zoom chat on October 7, did you manage to fix the script?

comment: [~Andrey.Kutsenko]: I finally got it work the issue fixing the space character issue when generating diff pdfs:



perl pdf_compare.pl rwcuml3_prod rwcuml3_parallel result_rwcuml3 -pixels 8 -threads 8



I finished running it earlier with the command above.

comment: QA is completed.
I ran the script with a lower pixel value to see the difference.
{code:sh}[andreyK@ca-unittest-pr-02 pdf_compare]$ perl pdf_compare.pl rwcuml3_prod rwcuml3_parallel result_rwcuml3 -pixels 5 -threads 8{code}
The test result is attached below. The differences are insignificant. Test - PASSED.
