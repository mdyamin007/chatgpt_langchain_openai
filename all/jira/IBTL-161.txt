comment: I believe this has to do with the ACE program because the file,mocums131.c1bmcok, is empty.

We might need again, Ernest's attention.

comment: In addition, I check the folder/d/zip/ on Brisbane, (10.4.20.31) and when I try to list the directory, it just hangs.

This is one of the path utilize byisisace2.sh.

comment: [~alexw]: Can you try one more time again? I think it might be a glitch on the /d/zip folder not being available. I didn't change anything, but like to see if the error is reproducible after you re-run it again.

comment: [~alexw]: I believe this issue is because PC did not add insert into DataTRAC. Can you work with PC tomorrow to confirm if the Insert Piece is entered via the database. Thanks!
