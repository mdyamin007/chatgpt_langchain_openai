title: MIFE (cd1):   RH2 to RHS Migration Project Processing Code Fix
description: During testing, DP noticed that this script does NOT create a .ran file. Please update processing script to create a .ran file.



Priority Level for this project is low so I'm setting due date to be 8/29/2022. This issues should not prevent us from continuing our testing of this application by DP.

comment: [~Sheikh_Fahim]: Since this passed QA, please go ahead and work with [~Peter.Dang]& [~rodriguez]to release this code. Please prep program transfer form so that they can review the release. I'm going to move the live date from 8/29 to 8/9 since this completed so much earlier.



[~Peter.Dang]/[~rodriguez]: We don't need parallel on this. This is an in-house enhancements to include a .ran file in the /home/keep directory. The original code did not include this logic.
