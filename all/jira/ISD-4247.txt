title: RWCU - New CD Maturity Letters (Child of 18593)
description: Joe/ISD,



I forgot to ask if this update involves any updates from ISD. Essentially, RWCU wants to split out standard CDs from ROTH and TRAD IRA notices.



Here is IS assessment:

1) Create new overlays from these new templates

2)Modify RWCUDL002.dfa to set apart the 'ROTH IRA' and 'TRAD IRA' records.

3) Modify RWCUDL002.dfa to implement new overlays and laser the text differently.



Thanks!
