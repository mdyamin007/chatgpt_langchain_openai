Parallel id:20220225112709

Working directory: /z/daily/apcudle/

Backup logs:/z/daily/apcudle_221/

The enhancement is to use segment number from datafile, change working to /z/daily/apcudle/, backup the log files to /z/daily/apcudle_<Cycle #><Segment#> and send email to dp and ac when there are no files to process.
