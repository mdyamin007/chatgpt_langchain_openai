comment: [~eric.yan] Please assist with this. If this involves posting multiple pre-ingestion files onto production, double check with Phoebe whether we need to temporarily disable emails at the time of posting. If so, then it may need to be a coordinated effort between IS/DP/ISD.

comment: [~eric.yan], Can you please check why thisms2_20220427_1_20220427_2134_sucu.txt index file not showing up on InfoTRAC pilot?

It works automatically on stage. Can you please post it manually on pilot? Thanks

Thedt_job_id is missing from dataTrac(IS) database, please add the entry to the estmt_dt table and let me know to post it.

I think the application was reprocessed today and it's posted on pilot, but the stmt date is off in the index file, so it's not showing on infotrac.

comment: [~eric.yan] Can you confirm that the dates are off? It is correct that the data is older data from 2020 as we are setting up this script for pre-ingestion cycles. Sorry, not quite sure which dates on the screenshot needs to be updated/changed, and if this is on the DSI/IS side. 

[~anwarh] FYI

The archival period on Infotrac is 2 years and the date falls out of the range. Except not showing on infotrac, everything else is good.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~eric.yan] Can you confirm the archival period, as I'm showing that it should be 36 months. Please confirm if the member site is also 24 months, or if 36.

Thanks

You're right, both prod and stage have 36 months. I've updated pilot to be 36 and it's showing up now. It's ready to be review.
