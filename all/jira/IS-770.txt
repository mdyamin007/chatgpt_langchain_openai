This tax update is ready for sample review.
 * A total of (4) samples have been attached, one for each of the following: 1098 [^lccu098131.sam.pdf], 1099Q [^lccu99q131.sam.pdf], 1099R [^lccu99r131.sam.pdf], and 1099INT[^lccu99i131.sam.pdf]

No parallel ID as no files were changed/added; the only thing changed is the addition of a symbolic link 
/${d_dir}/tax/prep/lccu_spec_handle.pl -> /home/master/tax_adding_correction_flag_for_1098_1099_irs.pl
