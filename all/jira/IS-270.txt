comment: Per Diego pull out 045 from main secfdlc and create it as separate application and there might be small formatting changes like automate dates.


author: rony
comment: Hi [~TunA],

Sorry for the late response, we are loaded with works at this point. So the requirement is:

separate the letter 045 from the existing daily letter and make it a separate application.

Can we still do the new application as daily with only one letter, meaning calling format_only and then isisdisk_daily. The reason for saying this,

there is some code between format only and isisdisk_daily call

!image-2021-08-24-22-51-28-858.png|thumbnail!

and also between 2 isisdisk_daily call for paper and enotice

!image-2021-08-24-22-52-13-187.png|thumbnail!



so for those parts, we don't need to do any change if implement new separate application just like daily. Let me know.



Thanks,

Rony

comment: Hi Rony,

Do we need e-notice option for this? I don't see in SOW though.

If yes, we will need to make sure file name and folder location for ISD is correct. Other than that, you can use the daily notice process flow (format_only/isisdisk_daily).

Thanks,

Tun

Due to some technical challenges, we couldn't start work yet. We will start on Monday. So please see, if you can update the sample date,

Thanks


author: kericapote
comment: [~rony]When will samples be ready?


author: rony
comment: Hi [~kericapote]

Based on the current workload we can't make it this week. We will provide it 28th of this month. Would it be possible to negotiate the live date with the customer? I am so sorry.

Thanks,

Rony


author: kericapote
comment: [~rony] that's fine. These letters come in January so we have some flexibility. I don't want to push it to the last minute though as that is our bottleneck with the code freeze and taxes.

comment: Hi [~kericapote] ,

PDF Sample is Attached.
Would you pleas provide us the dt_job_id. So we can post in infotrac.

Thanks,

author: kericapote
comment: [~fahad] I'm not sure who asks PC for DT Job ID but I think it's IS. Do you want it for pilot, production, or parallel?

I will ask about the naming and what app we are going to call it.

comment: [~fahad]the customer wants to use a variable for the date that changes every year. Can you please review the test file on ticket 14899 and let me know if that file will work? OK to review with [~rony] or the InfoImage Manager to see if we need to adjust scope.


author: kericapote
comment: [~fahad] [~rony] were you able to review the new test file on ticket 14899 to see if we can use the bariable? Please provide feedback. 

Thx!

comment: [~Igor.Khosid] have you gotten this yet? Samples were approved 10/14 and I sent print samples last week. This job has AOLP tpo.

THX!


author: kericapote
comment: [~fahad]

Yes on householding.

SEFC_PS-RMDN.STM_ mmddyyyy.txt.pgp is the naming convention.

Pending if they want Archival and Invalid Address Report

They are familiar with AOLP so have QA check it but SEFC does not need to test.






author: william.kong
comment: [~kericapote]: You forgot to update this Story Due Date. Please be careful so that we do not miss the communication.



[~fahad]: FYI. New live date is 11/15/2021


author: JIRAUSER10910
comment: Hi [~kericapote],

Any update regarding Archival & Invalid Address report? Please let us know ASAP.

Thanks.


author: kericapote
comment: [~fahad] Yes, the customer responded. I will update the SOW.

We do not need any additional PDF archive beyond the current 45 days the PDF is available in InfoTrac.

We also do not need the Invalid Address Report. 
 However we would like to suppress any notices that have DO NOT MAIL in the address.

We wont send more than one file on any day  so I think we are good without segment number.

Please provide dpvs and print range.

Please confirm AOLP is set up.
