*Hi Keri,* Please let me know when we go new eform. We may not go live in 07/30. Plus, we did not schedule for this project yet.

Thanks,

comment: Hey Jun,

We need to update the ALCU statement e-Form back, that you updated last month. (Reference toJIRA_IS-120 ALCU Return mail . Update address).

Keri attached new eform to replace but I think she is still waiting for eform color-approval from client first. Please follow up with her again in one or two days.

We will need to *go LIVE this month-end*.

Thanks,

Tun

comment: [~kericapote]I don't see option to delete the file either. Is "ALCU 3672 Stmt Original.pdf" the correct resource to use?
