description: Can you find out what Peter needs in regards to the accounting portion of this from Accounting

comment: Per Peter:

I dont have the full details what accounting will need from the print process; however, I do know that the print back end process will return total counts of accounts, images, and pages back to the Inforeach front-end which allow accounting to view billing records.

Tyler may able to share some information on this.
