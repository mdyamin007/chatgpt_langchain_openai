comment: Hi [~ratnam] [~phoebe.george],

First sample of this project is ready in/z/download/sscu/sscums3130.pdf

The file size is big that's why we can't place it in jira.

I used dataMM_STMXT1.TXT from latest data (which is inside MM_STMXT_02012022.zip) to generate sample.

The " Valued Member Since" part that should go on top of message manager area, is not present in sample because we have some questions and we need preprocessing to use the csv file (ValuedMemberSinceReport.csv) which requires time.The question regarding this will be posted in ss.

Please review the sample and then provide it to client.

If you are facing trouble to get the files please let me know. Or you can ask help from Tun.

Thanks


author: mahbubs
comment: Hi[~ratnam],

Please see attached sample.[^sscums3130_requested_members.pdf]

This sample has the member numbers that you attached in ss row 28.

But I didn't find some of the member numbers in the data files inMM_STMXT_02012022.zip.



{{813722   found in MM_STMXT4.TXT}}
{{331651   didn't find}}
{{100206950 found in MM_STMXT1.TXT}}
{{458428   found in MM_STMXT5.TXT}}
{{100240534 found in MM_STMXT1.TXT}}
{{100238767 found in MM_STMXT1.TXT}}
{{656428   didn't find}}
{{100227676 found in MM_STMXT1.TXT}}
{{100230215 found in MM_STMXT1.TXT}}
{{24989   didn't find}}
{{904556   didn't find}}
{{45900   didn't find}}
{{819638   found in MM_STMXT1.TXT}}
{{50429   didn't find}}
{{100205952 found in MM_STMXT1.TXT}}
{{100115933 found in MM_STMXT3.TXT}}



So in total 10 customers in this sample.

Let me know if anything more you need.

comment: Hi Sakib and Prama,

Currently, SSCU monthly view statement contain check image link with check images. I will be updating SOW with just mapping for the index file that the program will need to generate for ISD. Also, attached the current sample of index file from production and also the Index file specifications as requested by Rony, referviewCheckLinkSpecifications.pdf andms1_check_01312022_02012022_0819_sscu.7z(I had to zip as the file is huge but the original file will not be zipped ).



Please note below specifications required for Index file-
 # In reviewing with Rony, the index file name naming convention would be *ms3_cycleDate_processingDate_HHMM_sscu.txt* for core conversion.
 # The mapping for Index file content is below-***Member Number*(required)|*Checking Account Number*(need)|*Check Number*(need)|*Check Date*(need  MM/DD/YYYY)|*Check Amount*(need)|Tran Code(do not need)

     Member Number:R:0001 C:22(14)

     Checking Account Number:R:2000 C:22(17)

     Check Number:R:3000 C:64(12)

     Check Date: R:3000 C:39(10)

     Check Amount:R:3000 C:49(11)

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Monthly Statement current specifications: *(existing set up in production - USED BY ISD)*
 * Will contain check image links with check images pulled from SSCUs system (ImageCenter 2011 IBI Installation Guide.doc contains query specifications  use ImgReq.aspx specs)
 * Check Image Pre-Production URL: [https://img.safecu.org/ICWebServices/BundleExportServices/ImgReq.aspx]
 * Check Image Production URL: [https://img.safecu.org/ICWebServices/BundleExportServices/ImgReq.aspx] (same as pre-production)
 * Check links to be included starting with January 2012 production cycle. Pre-archived files prior to January 2012 do not need to include check links within the PDF, however, any checks should be searchable through the ViewCheck module.
 * Required fields: Account #, Check #, Routing number 321173742 *(for all checks)*.
 * Account # format required is a combination of Account #, a suffix and a check digit. For algorithm, please refer to SSCU Check Index File Specifications_042213.pdf embedded PDF:
 * Always display front and back check images

Thanks

comment: Hi [~ratnam] [~William.Kong],

In existing setup,There is a condition for printing either a micr number or formatted account number (check account number with suffix and check digit) in check index logic.

!image-2022-03-16-22-08-59-087.png!

In existing setup a micr number is extracted from the data.

If that micr number is not empty then the micr number get printed in check index.

If the micr number is not found from data then the formatted account number get printed in check index.

We need to know where we can find micr info in OSI DNA data.

Pleaselet client know about it.

Thanks


author: william.kong
comment: [~ratnam]: Please go ahead and share the logic w/ SSCU so that they can confirm where in OSI Record Layout do we pull the MICR line data. ZZ006 is the current field id from their existing data file format (e.g.:

Here is the SOW link again for reference:

comment: [~mahbubS] I wanted to update the Jira ticket with this info as well:
 # Latest samples from Rony are APPROVED.
 # DP has copied the 4/30 production file to the following location:/d/infoftps3/Vend_DSI/client_pickup/print_process/SSCU/ sscu_stmt_043022_1.zip.pgp

Can you test process this and provide samples based on the same account list on the Jira ticket that you have used previously? We would like SSCU to get a head start on validating samples using the production file while we continue with final QA. We also want to confirm the paperless file is pulling and the eSUPP count is correct.

Thanks again!
