comment: Hi [~rodriguez]Looks like the client is resuming this project.



Can you please advise if we used the the suppression to suppress accounts w/ 0 contribution.


author: rodriguez
comment: [~MattL]We did not for the samples. However there is no code change needed for this. In order to suppress when this goes live, the AC must check box for 0 contribution suppression on TJEF so DP can run with 0 contribution suppression.
