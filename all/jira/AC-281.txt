title: FLCU - [23318][pvt][in-house] In-House Request to fix Statement error
description: This is about Interest Charged overflow error for ISIS version 6.



William comment in TS #23039:

"Please re-assign ticket to AC to create an in-house ticket for this issue as we would like to implement a permanent fix for next month should this issue occur again."



I tried adjust print position for interest charged lines, but the error cannot go away. I don't know if you have other idea. When you have time, please try to adjust it.



If it doesn't work, please discuss with William for how to proceed. We may either update to ISIS version 7 or get help from ISIS.



You can test as follow:

- I attached project.

- Update/home/test/isis/docdef/FLCUMS11_TEST.dfa

- Run /home/master/pr_test.sh in rh2 ( for parallel env)

- Run following command straight for formatting:
