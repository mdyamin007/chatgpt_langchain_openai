comment: [~eric.yan], FFFC has more they need to add to the footer as well as a minor change to the subject field. Please see below:

The samples are not approved. I have neglected more of the changes that needed to be done along with the footer. See the screenshot below and the highlighted areas. Note that we added "Share Cert" in the subject field. So, it should read "Re: Share Cert Account Number Ending in+*XXXX*+". The other item is related to the footer note. In the first sentence next to the word "today" should have the number "1" next to it to denote the footer.

comment: [~berezinez]and [~eric.yan], updated sample submitted for client review. Thanks


author: dyuen
comment: [~eric.yan], please see client feedback on the updated samples.



The team found some issues. Please fix the following:
 * We are asking to delete the line in the footer area !image-2021-08-18-14-46-26-613.png!
 * Capitalize the N in Number and the E in ending in the subject field
!image-2021-08-18-14-46-52-401.png!

 * The disclosure portion is also missing verbiage. The current version has the disclosure correct. For some reason the samples are not using the correct disclosure.

comment: [~eric.yan], just to confirm, in the print samples the minimum balance still shows $0.00, but that's because of the test file you used, correct?
Thanks


author: eric.yan
comment: [~dyuen]

Yes, that's correct. I double check the data file and it's $0 instead of $1000.


author: dyuen
comment: [~eric.yan], great. Looks like QA completed their part and we should be good for code release on Friday. Please confirm.

Thanks


author: dyuen
comment: [~eric.yan], I confirmed with the client. It is OK to release code today. Please confirm once complete.
