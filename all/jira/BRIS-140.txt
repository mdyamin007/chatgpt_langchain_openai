title: DDS Vision-S Temporary Server
description: [~kent.chan]: Not sure who you are going to assign this task, but you stated that you are going to setup a temporary Vision DDS server. Please note that BRIS-138 "DataTRAC DB" has higher priority than this task.



Side question. Did you want to keep the "Vision-s" server name or use a new host name "ca-dds-pr-01". Please advise and update Brisbane Server list accordingly.

comment: [~premraj.patil]: Per my spark message, shouldn't this be in the database subnet of 10.4.32.### instead of 10.4.20.###?


author: william.kong
comment: [~premraj.patil]: Also, can you please create rh1login account and use the same P##########@ password?


author: william.kong
comment: [~premraj.patil]: I also forgot to add "cifs" port request. I updated the description box as well too.:

RDP port is needed for only 10.4.20.127.

SO its a Domain account (InfoIMAGE\rh1login) you were trying.
