Hi Keri, could you request a 1099M test file from the client? I cannot find a previous production/test 1099M tax file for FHNB. The last production run for 1099M was in December of 2017.

For the other tax forms, I was able to find and use test files from 2021.

Thanks,
Sam

The client has yet to provide a response on whether they can provide a 1099M test file. Can we disregard this tax form and proceed with producing samples for review?

Thanks,
Sam


author: kdishroon
comment: Hi [~SamV2021] - Yes, please disregard the 1099M and proceed with the rest.

Please review the provided samples. All 6 tax applications have been updated, but no sample is provided for 1099-MISC as the client wishes to disregard sample approval for it.
 * Updated project files have been copied over to /d/iss/qa/FCSB/FHNB[form].zip
 * Attached combined samples for each tax application[^fhnbtax_samples.pdf]

Black and white logo S1FHNBL3.300 (provided by the client in TS#28400 comment #4) has been resized to have the same width as the old logo. Resource has been provided to ISD on ISD-7466.

comment: QA first round sample result: Pass and Samples ready for Customer review
 DFAs checked in Papyrus.
 note:
 1) *FHNB-Tax - 1042 S - FHNB42S.dfa* -> Requires clarification (see BT-222)
 2) need to review BT-221

comment: [~Andrey.Kutsenko]

Please review this second of set of samples [^fhnbtax_samples_rev2.pdf]. The following changes were made:
 * Modified FHNB498.dfa, specifically the return address in the top left. Per client feedback in TS#28400 comment #37, the return address was missing the bank name.
 * Modified FHNB99R.dfa, specifically the vertical starting position of the return address (to match the other tax forms).
 * Addressed BT-221.
 * Note that all instances of the bank name (e.g. FORT HOOD NATIONAL BANK) along with other details in the return address and in the 'from'/lender address come from the data.

The following e-tax index files should be posted to pilot, but let me know if they are not.
 * etax_1042s_12312021_1_08292022_151359_fhnb.txt
 * etax_1099int_12312021_1_08292022_151751_fhnb.txt

Per my comment in BT-278, the 1042S data file used for testing: FHNB_1042S_11162021_0852_TEST.pgp does not specify any TINs. So, posting of the 1042S e-tax index file failed because it currently uses the TIN, which was not defined.

Please check with the client whether they are okay with using the account number instead (and that it will always be defined), as shown below, for electronic posting purposes.
