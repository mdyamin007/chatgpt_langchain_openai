Hi Dawn, any updates on this?

comment: [~mac]- client request to test with full production file. See IS-1032.

Please provide abigger paperless file. See Rony's note in IS-1032.

Here is client's feedback.

" do the 64 records match up to what members selected as estatement only in the paperless management system at InfoIMAGE? That number seems quite low for the end of month statements though.If Diego is still on this project, maybe you, he and I can get on a call to go over this so we can work through it quickly. "



Diego also response to client as below.

"Dan, the 64 number is based on a small file. For some reason they didnt run this with the full enrollment paperless. There was only about 115 accounts in the test account list and 64 matched. The production file contains something like 8500 accounts that are enrolled in paperless. Dawn, can we have them test with the full file."

Hi Dawn,

The last enrollment file that we processed on production and pilot was on 9/28/2021. Can the client send me a more updated enrollment file so I can process it on pilot?


author: dawnl
comment: Hi [~mac],

Can you refresh the pilot enrollment data from the production system? Seeclient's feedback below:

"Hi Dawn, I need to do some digging around to see if we still have the programming for the enrollment file. Could this be something where you could refresh the pilot enrollment data from the production system? I will keep looking here, but wanted to throw that out there in the meantime. Thanks, Dan"

Hi Dawn,

If possible, can they provide a full enrollment file first so we can post on pilot as it would be easier? If not, we may be able to sync pilot enrollment data with prod.

Can you provide thefile specs for the enrollment file? See client's response below.

"if you can send over the file specs for the enrollment file, we can look into re-programming to it. "


author: JIRAUSER10913
comment: [~dawnl]

Hi Dawn,

These are the specs: CIF|ACCTOWNERNAME|ACCTNUMBER|ACCTTYPE|DELIVERYPREFERENCE|EMAIL


author: dawnl
comment: Hi [~mac],

Can you send over details as to what the delivery preference options are? See client's response below.

"Can you send over details as to what the delivery preference options are? Since members manage their preferences through the InfoIMAGE paperless management system, we really do not have delivery preferences on our system so should we just default it to one value? Thanks, Dan"

comment: [~dawnl]

Hi Dawn,

Since the client doesn't have delivery preferences, then they should default the value to *E* to have the members enrolled into electronic if this enrollment file is to solely enroll the members into electronic.


author: dawnl
comment: Hi [~mac],

Here is client's response:

"If we go with E, then everyone get entered into that paperless file which I believe is what is being tested. If that is the desired result, we can go with that."


author: JIRAUSER10913
comment: [~dawnl]

Yes, that sounds good.

comment: [~mac],

The newenrollment file has been placed in the \test FTP directory.
|test/pfcu_enrollment_05042022.txt.pgp|



Here is client's response:

"New enrollment file has been placed in the \test FTP directory, let me know if you need anything else. This file should only be loaded into PILOT and not Production."

Hi Dawn,

The file that the client sent I processed, but the contents in there was incorrect as the acct type passed in was in numerical values such as '00' rather than something like 'CK'.. The file also contained over 60k entries which also seemed incorrect?

Anyways, I ended up digging around and found the full enrollment file from 9/28/2021. I was able to process that with no issues.

Here is the report. Please let me know if there are any issues.
