comment: Hello David,

I have updated the sheet and added the required port from lower environments tp ca-utils-pr-01(port 22)

comment: Kent,

Can you take a look at the new Sheet that Shahaded added. There are a few port access highlighted in Yellow that need to open.

Thanks
David

These are not working -

ca-afp2web-dv-01 -> ca-isilon01-nfs Port: CIFS and NFS
ca-afp2web-dv-02 -> ca-isilon01-nfs Port: CIFS and NFS

Need to mount -

ca-isilon01-nfs:/input-dv

ca-isilon01-nfs:/dev_pvnas/indiv_afp

ca-isilon01-nfs:/dev_pvnas/indiv_afp2

ca-isilon01-nfs:/dev_pvnas/peb3
