[~Peter.Dang] question from DSI, can you confirm?

 _I have a question in the jira ticket. 6 Loan projects were mentioned. But I worked on only 4 projects which are LN6280,6281,6283,6288. I don't know any details regarding the other two projects. which is LN6660, 2200. Do I have to also implement this to those 2 project?_
