comment: [~rony]please provide the new index file like in [IS-921|https://jira.infoimageinc.com/browse/IS-921].

comment: Hi[~avannik]

For only ms1 we provided an index file with wrong naming(extra underscore mentioned in bt-364) and old structure, the rest of the index files were in the correct structure.

Let me know if you are facing issues with other index files.



Thanks

comment: [~TunA] has this been released?   Please advise asap.

comment: Hi [~anwarh], [~kericapote],

I think I released the same codes forIS-1691 that [~rony]messaged me to release for Nouros.

Isn't that the same?

author: phoebe.george
comment: [~TunA] I believe they are two different updates, one is an eStatement index file update for application ms4, and the other for IS-1691 was for a release for DNA and DLA applications. Can you double check that was released accurate (for the right update), as I had DP run the job in production and the update was not in place.
