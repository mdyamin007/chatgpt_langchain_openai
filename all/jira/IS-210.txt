Could you assign someone to test the new index file below:
/d/isd_input_dev/I3/process-files/oscu/dlb_20210715_1_20210715_1500_oscu.txt

Thanks

We were able to test dlb_20210715__20210715_1447_oscu.txt after adding in the segID.

I see that the index file you listed has the segID there. However, we cannot find this file inside the input folder.

Thanks,
Tai

Could you try this one?
/d/isd_input_dev/I3/process-files/oscu/dlb_20210715_1_20210715_1447_oscu.txt

The zip file name inside this index is missing segment number.

Actually, I think the one I posted first is the right one, it has the matching zip file.

But somehow the index file is now missing. I'm going to regenerate it and update you later.

Could you try to post this one. It should have the correct format.
/d/isd_input_dev/I3/process-files/oscu/dlb_20210713_1_20210720_1149_oscu.txt

zip file is here

OSCU has already approved the posted eNotices on pilot; okay to proceed with next steps/workflow.
