comment: [~ernestw]: The priority for this task has changed. Please leave this ticket "TO-DO" backlog stage of this Brisbane Board;



The plan has changed to use "cloned" VMs for the ISWK/RedTitan systems instead of the fresh install; We will revisit the fresh install after we move into Brisbane DataCenter.



I will be create 3 NEW Jira Tickets for "Cloned" VMs Setup

comment: Per meeting clarification last week and the updated Brisbane server list. We will NOT be using the "cloned" version of the ISWK servers. All of the physical ISWK Menlo servers will be physically to Brisbane.



So this task is CANCELLED
