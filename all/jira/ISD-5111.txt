title: Hypercube- BKPL: Display delivery preference as non-editable text field
description: For BKPL, the "Delivery Type" of each account should be displayed as an uneditable text field. Currently, in Hypercube, there are radio buttons to display delivery preferences. For BKPL, there will be no radio buttons. Only current paperless status (Paper or Paperless) of each account will be shown as "Delivery Type" and it'll be displayed as a non-editable text field.
