I did not see the test data for the following letters.

30_PPS_<OfficerName>.txt

90_PPS_<OfficerName>.txt

Please request customer to send these test data files.

EWBB wanted to know what if there is any special  logic for inserts.

Thanks, Barnett 


author: andyp
comment: [~barnetts]

We mapped the file name to the letter matrix as in description section.

For inline inserts, I was not the original developer that set up these letters.

I saw it in the codes. Could you check SOW to have these inline inserts information?


author: barnetts
comment: [~andyp],

The SOW is updated and attached [^EWBB_ONTRACK_SOW_07.24.2021.doc] . It looks like the inline is from a previous JEF 41808

Samples sent for EWBB approval.

Thanks, Barnett 


author: barnetts
comment: [~andyp], 

EWBB likes the samples however they need to revise the formatting a bit to fix the spacing within the letter. I don't think this will effect things on the letter, but I think we should request the revised test data to be safe. What are your thoughts?

Thanks, Barnett   


author: andyp
comment: [~barnetts]

I agree. If they revise the formatting, we would need test data to verify.


author: barnetts
comment: Hi Andy,

EWBB wants to know, if the font style is from EWBB's txt files or is it from our end? They noticed the font is different between their existing letters and the samples that were printed. They are trying to understand why the existing font is different. 

Thanks, Barnett 


author: andyp
comment: [~barnetts]

The font style is from our designer program.

The txt file from customer just has plain text.


author: barnetts
comment: Thank you [~andyp]


author: barnetts
comment: Hi [~andyp],

I am still pending EWBB for new test data. Not sure when this will be completed. I think it is safe to assume that this will push the due date back. I am going to push the due back as a result

Thanks, Barnett


author: william.kong
comment: [~Peter.Dang]: Please work with [~andyp]& [~barnetts]to re-evaluate a revised timeline for this project as to when next year to resume this project. Client is late on this project.


author: william.kong
comment: [~andyp]: Pending client review.



[~Peter.Dang]: Please review and re-assess the timeline if there further adjustments.



[~barnetts]: Live date of 12/15 is not accurate. Please with the guys next week after EOM to get this straightened out on the timeline expectation during code freeze period.


author: barnetts
comment: Hi Andy,

3 New test data provided (00_CTT_AaronFong, 90_PPS_RonJohnson, 30_CTT_DavidLee)

EWBB has revised the query to fix the spacing issues on the new letters. 

However, there is one indent issue that they were unable to fix since line items are not indented on the txt files when a bulletin item prints to a 2nd row. Can you check to see if this can be fixed? Please refer to screenshot (Correction_Mock_up_1.4.22)

The new update is address spacing issues that EWBB has found.
Yes, can you please provide another round of samples.

Please check with customer to finalize all the changes they want to update format mock up or file name processing.

We will need a test data file which contains all the letters to test parallel and printing paper.

Please advise on the new live date.

There was some issue with the bullet characters in the new data file which i did not see it before. This was causing program did not print these characters correctly.

I attached a snap shot of those characters and also the PDF sample from 00_CTT letter.

Please notify customer that if they want to change the format of the letters they need to tell us to program update.

Hi [~andyp],

New test data is provided. Can you please see if the new data fixes the weird character from the bullets.

Thanks, Barnett 


author: andyp
comment: [~barnetts]

This test data file in cycle 03/11 had exactly the same bullet character issue as the test data files in cycle 02/22. I did not see any change in the character format.



FYI, the test data file that customer sent in 01/04 had the bullet character that program can handle it. Also this was the test data file that was approved by customer.



Please request customer resend the test data with the same character as the approved test data in cycle 01/04.

comment: Hi [~andyp],

The client is asking if you are looking at the file they sent on 3/14; because you indicated above you were looking at 3/11. Just want to confirm if that is a typo.


author: andyp
comment: [~kdishroon]

Yes, it was a typo. The file that I was looking at was cycle 03/14.

BTW, we did not receive any test data for cycle 03/11.


author: barnetts
comment: Hi [~andyp],

I am following up with EWBB about the bullet formatting issue.

Thanks, Barnett  


author: barnetts
comment: Hi [~andyp],

Please see EWBB response below. 
Our test data in January was generated using Python to create the txt files. Since we automated it, our developers created a C# scheduled task to create the files. From our end, the bulletins havent changed since its created into the data set itself, but the creation of txt files is through a scheduled task rather than Python. 

Thanks, Barnett


author: barnetts
comment: Hi [~andyp],

EWBB has made corrections and provided 2 additional test files using two different method.  Can you please provide samples for both and advise which file works better?
(1) EWBB_OnTrack /  was completed via python as our temporary solution
(2) EWBB_OnTrack_031422TESTREVISED / the text file coding has been changed from UTC-8 to ANSI.
