Following up on the status of this.


author: william.kong
comment: [~MattL]: What is the status are you following up on? If are asking for the next steps, then I just spoke with Eric. He is going to move the over to QA.

Also, I noticed the live date is July 5, 2021 which is a Monday. We are observing Monday as a holiday. Can this be released this Friday instead or Tuesday.





[~eric.yan]: Per our discussion, please move this Jira ticket to QA and check in with Matt if live date can be move outside of the Monday holiday.


author: mattl
comment: Hi [~William.Kong]I was asking what the status was because I haven't seen movement on this since I advised that client approved last week.



[~eric.yan]if we could release this on friday that would be great as I am out of office next week.

I guess we know the rules. I do not want to fail this now
This story is turned over to QA, and I do not see the PR ID and sounds we need to have print samples. Please attach dpvs and request print samples

Please attach to the story the previous version of the letter (pdf) for comparison

For previous bad sample, please refer to ticket 17941 and 20630.

Print sample is not needed since it's only verbiage change.

Are you sure provided PR ID is correct ?SUCUDL024.dfa but not HRBK?


author: mattl
comment: Hi [~eric.yan],

Along with the PR ID question [~Igor.Khosid]posed, I thought this was an alignment update & not a verbiage update? Can you confirm? If it's an alignment issue shouldn't we get some print samples to [~Igor.Khosid]?

comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid],

sorry, the pr_id is 20210630145029
There are two issue here. 1) formatting issue in ticket 17941, and 2) footer position issue on ticket 20630. I don't think printed sample is needed here, but we could request one if you feel it's necessary.
