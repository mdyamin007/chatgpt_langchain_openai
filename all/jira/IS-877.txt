is there any update on my previous comment from yesterday? regarding DL011?


author: yameelee
comment: [~berezinez], [~Igor.Khosid]and [~jharvey]

For DL011 they have 2 different templates. There is one template for account_type 53 and another one for else. The one on the left is account_type 53 and the one on the right is for the else condition.

I looked at the data file in QA folder, there is no account_type 53. Please use this test file the client sent ([^BKFN_lnm215.TXT]). This data file has both account_types.
