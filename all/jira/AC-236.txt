I don't see why this ticket requires ISD.

This change on affect printed statements. Additionally, Parallel is set to None, so seems like we don't even have to go through parallel, which means ISD should never have to get involved.

Thanks,
Tai

I created the ISD story since Tun had ISD hours in his assessment. If ISD is not involved, I will close this out for you, thank you for the heads up.
