comment: [~rony], please see feedback from RWCU:

The only notices in this test file were for rwcuodpMMDD.txt. I did not see any for rwcubadaddMMDD.txt.

Are client seeing the correct archival file?

comment: [~rony]I believe RWCU was looking at the wrong PDF sample. They reviewed the PDF sample with the Bad Address Notice and has approved it for production.

"These were imported successfully. This can moved to PROD."

Please confirm when code has been released.
