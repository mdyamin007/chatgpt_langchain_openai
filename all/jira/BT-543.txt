comment: Hi [~ratnam],
 Currently we are putting the amount
 If <CreditDebitIndicator> == C then in Payments
 Else if<CreditDebitIndicator> == D then in Charges.
 Else in Payments.

Please update the mapping.

 If you look at it there's two transaction, the transaction now getting printed and you mentioned is the 2nd one. The second one has<CreditDebitIndicator> and which is of value "D"

and the first one is not getting printed. The one you are looking at in xml data file is the first one. which has <TranDesc> of "Starting Principal Balance" and it is not getting printed.

because it doesn't follow the rule given below. The transaction isn't displayed.
