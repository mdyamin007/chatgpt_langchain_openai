Hi Joye,

I can't release today because we are currently following a release schedule. The new schedule is that for a release to happen, it must be QA'd a week in advance, so this ticket must have been moved to staging and have QA'd completed last week. Thus, we can't make the release date for today. The release will have to happen next week 8/4, as I'm going to submit it for QA tomorrow. I have updated the dates. Let me know if you have any questions, thanks!
