comment: [~TomasL] base on the workflow, you will need to create a story subtask from this epic "AC-17" and ensure to check status "project initiated". The assignee of this epic remains as the AC. Once you're done creating the subtask, it will automatically trigger IS work flow.

comment: [~TomasL]a few notes:
 * The Assignee of this epic ticket should be the AC/Impl managing the project
 * Once all the details are filled in, you'd create a story ticket for IS/ISD from "More > Create ISD/Print Story." This will copy all the relevant fields and ticket for the respective department
