dma index file has wrong date format MMddyyyy. It should be yyyyMMdd.

Also, the zip file for this index file is not present in the server.

Thanks.

comment: Hi [~phoebe.george] [~tai.trinh] ,

The zip file for dma was on enotice folder in Pilot machine as per Tai instructed. I've moved the file to right folder and posted the file.

The file contains total of 12 records that had no account number on them. So those are not recorded into database.

The rest 478 records had been posted to pilot.

Thanks

Azad.

The location_/z/download/ewbb/mortgage_ holds the zip file*ewbb_ml_welcome_letter_12152021.zip*.

The updated index file_[^dma_05132021_1_20211227_1153_ewbb.txt]_finds the zip named*ewbbdma_15_1_20211227_1153_0.zip*.

Please provide me the correct zip file to process dma.

Thanks,

Azad

To process dma see procs /home/test/procs/ewbbdma.procs use the file: /z/download/ewbb/mortgage/ewbb_ml_welcome_letter_12152021.zip.pgp

comment: [~Azad] I noted on a separate Jira ticket, but EWBB had previously approved the pilot site.

QA is in progress on the IS story. Please prepare your items in preparation for parallel testing, I'll be submitting this once QA is completed.

I will update each of the Jira ISD stories with this same update tied to this project. Thanks!


author: JIRAUSER11003
comment: [~Azad] can you please look atIS-596

EWBB doesn't have enotices on production. From my understanding although it's technically a letter, it should still be posting under the mortgage tab on the e-site and therefore should be considered a mortgage statement instead of enotice.


author: azad
comment: To QA,

Process _*dma_05132021_1_20211227_1153_ewbb.txt*_ to test Welcome Letter eNotices. dma will be processed via Document processing.

Index file and zip file are already on place. Run the job with 'Parallel Run' checked to process on test mode.

For testing purpose, doc process will create account if new.

Thanks!

Verified welcome mortgage letters on staging Admin site, same eNotices are showing on both eStatement tab and on Mortgage tab, and it states that first payment due on June 1, 2021.

Please confirm that it is OK and i can release this story

comment: Hi [~nprimak],

EWBB admin site has a business to show all ESTMT_DOC statements on a single eStatement tab, not on different tabs like loan, dda_velo or mmidas. That means, all black knight mortgage statements will be shown on the tab named "eStatement" (It is true for other black knights tickets too). While setting up mortgage statements this business was ignored. That's why the Welcome Letter eNotices are showing on both eStatement tab and on Mortgage tab. I've fixed the issue.

Please check and let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks!

Hi Azhar,

The issue is fixed, I see mortgage letter only once on eStatement tab, but what about other issue with old statement showing as first payment due on June 1, 2021?

Should I ignore it and production will have updated letter?

Thank you,

Natasha

comment: Hi [~nprimak]

You can ignore the old statement issue as in production, updated letter will be posted.

Thanks!

Thank you,
