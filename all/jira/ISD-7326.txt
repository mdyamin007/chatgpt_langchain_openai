Please see client's response to your question about changing the name for account 306657

Elizabeth Zayas is only tied to the DDA/checking account for account # 306657.

I cannot even find the other customer in the Core.

Can you see the last time you received a statement for Aubrey?

I am assuming she had the savings account, but I am not sure.

comment: [~jharvey] I don't see any statements under the dda nor savings account 306657.

Please update the DDA 306657 to Elizabeth Zayas.

Please update the SAV 306657 to Customer.

comment: [~jharvey] Updates have been made.

DDA 306657 should now show Elizabeth Zayas.
SAV 306657 should now show Customer.

DDA 302538 already has the name Linda J Herman due to some recent enotice postings, so I left this as is.

Sorry forgot to bring this up earlier, but there is also a loan acct type for acct 302538 who currently has the name 'SCOTT M KALTENBACH'. Is this fine to keep as is or should we update it?

Please leave the loan acct with the name of Scott Kaltenbach.

All of the other updates are correct.
