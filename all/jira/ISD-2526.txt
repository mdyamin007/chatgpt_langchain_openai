title: IDCU - Etax Replacement Flag Enhancement
description: When replaced eTaxes are posted, they need to have a status that indicate they are a replacement. This is NOT the same as the CORRECTED flag which is for the eTaxes that were replaced.



So instead of APPROVED, there need to be a new status that would also be visible to the client. Look into how this will affect all clients. Because instead of status is null or status = 9, it may need to be status is null or status >= 9. Is this a change that has to be done to all the Prism sites, or can it be done within only the ETaxDO?
