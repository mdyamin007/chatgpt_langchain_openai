Is there a way for the client to test this in pilot?

Thank you,

comment: Hi [~kdishroon],

Client can use this url to do sso: [https://eqbkpilot.infoimageinc.com:9780/]

The client can do the SSO using the following two accounts:
 # 100012475 : This account is not enrolled to the eStatement site. So the client will go through the 3 steps of the enrollment process. And on the 2nd step the client will view the disclosure page.
 # 6605006895 : This account is already enrolled to the eStatement site. So the client will view the disclosure page on the statement page.



Client can use this url to do DSO: [https://eqbkpilot.infoimageinc.com:9780/login.jsp]

Username: dsotest

Password: dsotest

Zipcode:65360



If the client could not access the url or could not perform the SSO please let us know.

Thank You!!

The client was unable to login to [https://eqbkpilot.infoimageinc.com:9780/]; he was able to login when we removed the 9780, but then he was not able to locate account 6605006895.

comment: Hi [~kdishroon],

The client might need CIF number as well, here I am giving a sample request for another account number:*6600005928*. And the account type is *TD.*


{code:java}
    <form action="https://eqbkpilot.infoimageinc.com/q2sso" method="post">
        <input type="hidden" name="cid" value="eqbk"><br>
        <input name="data" value="9f56d4acf103b1764095eb99df9bbd540000000000049872832606172022"><br>
        <input name="selected_acct1" value="6600005928"><br>
        <input name="selected_acct_type1" value="TD"><br>
        <input name="email" value="test@infoimageinc.com"><br>
        <input type="submit" name="submit" value="Get Key!"><br>
    </form>    
    <form action="https://eqbkpilot.infoimageinc.com/q2_hblogin.jsp" method="post">
        <input type="hidden" name="cid" value="eqbk"><br>
        <input type="text" name="key" value=""><br>
        <input type="submit" value="GO"><br>
    </form>
{code}
The CIF number for this account is*498728326*. In the form: the"data" is created from the CIF number.

[~Tin.Chak]let me know if I should add anything else.

Thank You!!

comment: [~sahossain] Can you look at the latest CIF/auth file from production and see which CIF that the account is tied to? Online Banking will only pass in those accounts from that file for a given CIF.


author: JIRAUSER11002
comment: Hi [~Tin.Chak], [~kdishroon],

At first, I provided the account number:*6605006895*which exists in the latest CIF file. For this account number CIF number is*500171535* and ACCT_TYPE is *DD*.

For the following request form, I think the client will be able to login:
{code:java}
    <form action="https://eqbkpilot.infoimageinc.com/q2sso" method="post">
        <input type="hidden" name="cid" value="eqbk"><br>
        <input name="data" value="e4153d5b602f94ffd47cf47bf3829e9b0000000000050017153506202022"><br>
        <input name="selected_acct1" value="6605006895"><br>
        <input name="selected_acct_type1" value="DD"><br>
        <input name="email" value="test@infoimageinc.com"><br>
        <input type="submit" name="submit" value="Get Key!"><br>
    </form>
    <form action="https://eqbkpilot.infoimageinc.com/q2_hblogin.jsp" method="post">
        <input type="hidden" name="cid" value="eqbk"><br>
        <input type="text" name="key" value=""><br>
        <input type="submit" value="GO"><br>
    </form>// code placeholder
{code}


I have provided another account number:*6600005928*but it does not exist in the latest CIF file. So try for the first one.

Please provide instructions on how the client can test this? Their OLB doesn't know what they are supposed to do:

author: JIRAUSER11002
comment: Hi [~kdishroon],

Updated the database for all users with SESS_ACTIVE_STATUS 'active' to pre_enroll.

*For SSO:* When a user login with 'pre_enroll' status and previously logged in, they will see the disclosure page, such as:

!disclosure vebiage.png|thumbnail!
If user agree to the disclosure page then SESS_ACTIVE_STATUS will set to 'active' and they will not see the disclosure page next time they log-in and will be redirected to the statement page. If the user disagree with the disclosure verbiage then the SESS_ACTIVE_STATUS will not update and they will see the disclosure page next time they log in.

*For DSO:* When a user login with 'pre_enroll' status, Then after token recovery, they will see the disclosure verbiage, such as:

!disclosure vebiage.png|thumbnail!
If user agree to the disclosure then SESS_ACTIVE_STATUS will be set to 'active' and they will not see the disclosure page when they login again and redirect to the statement page. If the user disagree with the disclosure page SESS_ACTIVE_STATUS will not update and they will see the disclosure page again.

*For SSO and DSO requests*, No changes were added to the process. So from the OLB side no changes would be needed.

Please let me know if should add anything else.



[~Tin.Chak]Can you please take a look all are right or Should i add anything else?

If there's going to be a call, please invite me only. For the SSO Form URL, please tell them don't use that. The bank need to give these two URL to the Online Banking vendor:

SSO Key Gen: [https://eqbkpilot.infoimageinc.com/q2sso]
 SSO Exchange: [https://eqbkpilot.infoimageinc.com/q2_hblogin.jsp]

They need to setup a test site that will point to those URL. The bank can test DSO as Sarwar provided.

*Here is the client's feedback:*

_"Q2 our online service provider confirmed they are already linking to the two URLs listed below._
_I'm attaching what I believe should be the pilot URL that should be updated. Currently, this link is displaying wrong disclosure."_

*In looking at the url from the screenshot the client provided, this appears to be the InfoIMAGE Pilot site, not Q2's. Shouldn't they be looking at Q2's pilot site? Please confirm.*

comment: [~kdishroon] They should be looking at both Q2 and InfoIMAGE pilot site, as this will help them understand what was changed. The screenshot is from DSO, so it's not through Q2.

[~sahossain] Please look into disclosure issue and advise.

Code will be released on 31, Aug.

Thank You


author: JIRAUSER11002
comment: To QA,

I have deployed my changes on stage.



This client has a new disclosure which they want all of their users to see, which means both new and old users have to see this disclosure. As you may already know, when a user enrolls, the SESS_ACTIVE_STATUS is set to active, and their sso/dso date is set so that the user doesn't have to enroll again when they log in next time. But for this task, we need the active users to see this disclosure without having to enroll them. So we updated usr_session table for all users with SESS_ACTIVE_STATUS 'active' to 'pre_enroll', and we set a logic that when a "pre-enroll" user logs in, he will see a disclosure before landing on the home page. If he agrees, then SESS_ACTIVE_STATUS will be set to active, and if he doesn't agree, then SESS_ACTIVE_STATUS will remain "pre_enroll", which means they will see the disclosure again when they log in next time. For new users, the logic remains the same as previous business.



*For SSO:*When a user login with 'pre_enroll' status and previously logged in, they will see the disclosure page, such as:

!Updated disclosureVerbiage.png|thumbnail!

If user agree to the disclosure page then SESS_ACTIVE_STATUS will be set to 'active' and they will not see the disclosure page next time they log-in and will be redirected to the statement page. If the user disagree with the disclosure verbiage then the SESS_ACTIVE_STATUS will not update and they will see the disclosure page next time they log in.

For SSO you can use the following credentials:
 # When sess_active_status = 'pre_enroll';user will view the disclosure. if user agrees then sess_active_status will be "active".
 ** *CIF_NUM*: 512821685
 ** *ACCT_NUM1*: 202015011
 ** *ACCT_TYPE1*: TD
 ** *ACCT_NUM2*: 80000215
 ** *ACCT_TYPE2*: DD
 # When sess_active_status = 'active';user will not view the disclosure.
 ** *CIF_NUM*: 001829672
 ** *ACCT_NUM1*: 6000296842
 ** *ACCT_TYPE1*: LN
 ** *ACCT_NUM2*: 6000315322
 ** *ACCT_TYPE2*: LN



*For DSO:*When a user login with 'pre_enroll' status, Then after token recovery, they will see the disclosure verbiage, such as:

!Updated disclosureVerbiage.png|thumbnail!

If user agree to the disclosure page then SESS_ACTIVE_STATUS will be set to 'active' and they will not see the disclosure page next time they log-in and will be redirected to the statement page. If the user disagree with the disclosure verbiage then the SESS_ACTIVE_STATUS will not update and they will see the disclosure page again.

For DSO you can use the following credentials:
 # When sess_active_status = 'pre_enroll';user will view the disclosure. if user agrees then sess_active_status will be "active".
 ** Username:dsotest
 ** Password: dsotest
 ** Zipcode: 65360
 # When sess_active_status = 'active';user will not view the disclosure.
 ** Username: testdso
 ** Password: testdso
 ** Zipcode: 64112



[^Electronic Documents Agreement 4.7.2022(1).docx]disclosureVerbiage is also updated for a new user.
 # When they go through the 3 steps of SSO enrollment they can see it in step 2.
 # When a user does register in DSO they can see it in step 2 of enrollments.
 # If users log-in with paperless status '*B*' then they can see a optout page for update paperless status to '*E*' that time they can see the updated disclosure verbiage.



Thank You!!
