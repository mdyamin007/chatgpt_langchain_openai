Eric,

Just a few questions:
 # What is the index file? Would you please attach to the story
 # Wondering if the new resources provided to ISD?



Mac, wondering if you had a chance to upload the new resources if they - provided?



Gnana,

Please, proceed with testing

The backer is not printed inline and I believe ISD has another method to load it.

[~mac]

Could you advise why [~gthillaivel] is not seeing the backer in e-statement?

Hi All

Wondering if this story is ready for the final testing? If ready why the status is "Waiting for approval"?

Eric, Mac,

Please be sure that all necessary information - provided


author: barnetts
comment: Hi [~gthillaivel], [~Igor.Khosid], [~eric.yan], [~mac],

The Stmt will not have a backer on the eSide that will not show up on the Pdfs. Instead the backer will show up on the Statement Disclosure tab.

Thanks, Barnett
