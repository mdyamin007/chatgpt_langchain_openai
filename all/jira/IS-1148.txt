Client says they do not currently have any accounts that are using this logo and asked that we use a fake account to test.  We did this in Team Support 13186.

 [~jharvey] please advise if it's ok?
 1) The sample is inside the envelope and we do a tap test down and to the left:

 +The address of the organization is not visible in the top window+

2) tap test up and to the left:

the return address under the logo is covered,

let me know if you're going to fix it and reduce the size of the logo to match the envelope window, or if we will print it in this way.


author: JIRAUSER11401
comment: [~berezinez] [~jharvey]

I already resized the logo and uploaded it on parallel too. The return address should be in the correct place now.

Please see Andrey's newest comment with the revised print sample.  You still are not able to view the return address, only the logo.  Is this acceptable?  Or do you need to adjust again?  We really need to get this live, we are almost a week past due.

comment: [~jharvey]& [~Andrey.Kutsenko] Sorry this is my bad. i did not check to see that this is printing from prisma and gave tevis wrong advice on not needing new afp file. He is going to reprocess and give new afp file for print.


author: JIRAUSER11401
comment: [~jharvey]

Sorry for the late reply. I reprocessed the program and the sample should be good now.
 here is the new index file:[^msbkme1104.print]
 and the sample:[^707011_msbkme11044.2o1.pdf](page 526)

Could you please request a new sample again with the new index file?

The file for the new print sample will be:707011_msbkme11044.2o1.afp and page 526

Thanks,
 Tevis
