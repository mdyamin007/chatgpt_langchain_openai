Can you please advise if this can be completed today? SSCU wants to know and I need to inform them if if you need more time.

Hi Barnett,

Sorry, I was busy dealing with other higher priority tickets today. I will complete it first thing in the morning tomorrow and will let you know once it is done.

For the request of account476933 to 934025, I will include that in the list as I process this on production tomorrow.
