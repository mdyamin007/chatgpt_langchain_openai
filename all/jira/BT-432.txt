QA will not be passed until the control file is corrected in accordance with the SOW.

Thanks for catching this but as I said already, per my knowledge this format value doesn't matter. Or let me ask you this. do you know what wrong would happen if the format value is opposite of what we see in papyrus? I don't know.



Check the FCSBDL042 papyrus vs control file, which is in production:

Please talk to Terrence Tun about this format value, and if this is something that must match with the papyrus display. Normally I don't pay attention to what value is set to this flag.



But anyway, I changed it to duplex forfcsbdl052.control.



Thanks

Oh, I see you asked to remove this flag if its value really doesn't matter. Actually, if I remove this script will give an error at some point, Some core scripts in the middle check this value in

the control file. Maybe in the old time, this value actually had some significance.



Anyway, if this is confusing to you we can discuss it with Terrence? May be that can bring us into same page.



Thanks
