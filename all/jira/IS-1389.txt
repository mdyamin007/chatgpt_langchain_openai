Attached are PDF samples created by taking a few of the data files.

Please let customer know there is a "S-1651_00147819_07222022.pdf" file that have an anchor that is different from the other S-1651 letters and subsequent pages are different size. Therefore it's still considered a bad file and cannot process. They need to keep the anchor in same position and the page size to be 8.50x11.00 inches. Let me know if it's okay to proceed.
