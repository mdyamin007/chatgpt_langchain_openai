Thanks


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~mahbubS] Thank you! Sample feedback from client is due 11/12. I have to update and send out a new timeline and will let provide access once ready. Thanks!


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~mahbubS] based on feedback that Enrico forwarded, can you confirm sample date? I'll update the timeline accordingly as I may need to target a new live date.


author: mahbubs
comment: Hi [~phoebe.george],

We will provide our next sample on Monday (11/29) with latest updates that Enrico forwarded.

Thanks


author: mahbubs
comment: Hi [~phoebe.george] [~enricob],

Attached is sample.[^mvcuml21248.pdf]

We used the data file20211119_122046_000.Statement_Production.xml to generate the sample.

Please review and provide it to client.

Let me know if there is any issues.

Thanks

author: phoebe.george
comment: [~mahbubS] 12/23 would be the new live date based on the updated timeline, but I do still need to get approval from Igor/QA on this revised timeline once you approve it.


author: mahbubs
comment: Hi [~phoebe.george],

12/23 live date seems good to me.

Thanks

comment: [~mahbubS] [~rony] [~phoebe.george]

Hi Sakib,
Returning the story to "In Progress" because this is an implementation project, and QA starts testing after the customer approves the samples.


author: mahbubs
comment: Hi [~phoebe.george],

Please notify when client approves the latest sample.

The live date is 12/23 and this need to go to QA ASAP.

Thanks


author: mahbubs
comment: Hi [~phoebe.george]and [~enricob],

Please ask Shawn, what if there <closeDate> exist in a customer data but empty. Like below-

<closeDate></closeDate>

And there could be multiple <Loan> tag for a customer. If we find<closeDate> in any <Loan> then would the whole statement be suppressed?

And would this suppression be only for paper, or would work for all option?

Thanks


author: mahbubs
comment: Hi [~phoebe.george],

The Jira shows live date 23 dec.

But in TS ticket24654 there is a discussion going on regarding suppression using <closeDate> tag.

So, please update the live date for this task as client is requesting more updates.

Thanks


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~mahbubS] Here is an update on the suppression question from the customer:

_If there is a close date in the XML then just that loan should be suppressed. If the close date is empty then it should generate on the statement._

Let me know if any additional questions. Thanks!


author: mahbubs
comment: Hi [~phoebe.george] ,

I still need confirmation about below query about <CloseDate> suppression:

Would this suppression be applicable only for paper, or would work for all option (paper, estmt, archival)?

Thanks


author: william.kong
comment: [~phoebe.george]: Spoke with [~mahbubS]and [~enricob]. The update will be completed by Tuesday, December 28, 2021. Live Date of today is not feasible due to the specification change for the suppression logic. Please confirm how long will QA team and OPS need to run parallel once we changes are completed and approved.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~William.Kong] [~mahbubS] I'll update the timeline to reflect a completion date of the suppression criteria for 12/28 and will update Igor/OPS as well since this will run into early Jan.

[~enricob] I'm still waiting to hear back from MVCU on the suppression for electronic, but will request if the SOW can be updated once confirmed - you're cc'd on the customer email, but she is OOO today.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~enricob] [~mahbubS] MVCU has approved the samples. Please confirm if the suppression criteria is still being worked on. I believe there is one pending question that needs to be confirmed that was sent via skype that Enrico is confirming. Please let me know.


author: mahbubs
comment: Hi [~phoebe.george],

Please review the attached sample.[^mvcuml41248.pdf]

This sample is generated using the latest program which has all the updated suppression logics.

Thanks


author: william.kong
comment: [~phoebe.george]: This project has a past due date. When is client anticipating the rollout of this project? We need to schedule this with Sakib and team. Please advise so that we can monitor this project properly.


author: phoebe.george
comment: Updated target live date is 1/17:

[https://app.smartsheet.com/sheets/QR9RM32p885QQ8gXwCjVX5FRvp37x9g4h2WqHv41]



However, we are behind schedule again, and QA time can no longer be used. New live date needs to be assessed again. Due date on print tab has already been updated on the Epic previously.


author: william.kong
comment: [~phoebe.george]: Unfortunately, we didn't know it was changed in the EPIC. If it is changed in EPIC, please alert us in Story. I will update this ticket for 1/17/2022 so that it is in our radar that live date is upcoming. Please alert us again once you know the revised live date from QA team.

Please attach the xml hat match data file provided with the project "C:\ISIS_719\userisis\data\mvcuml4.dat"


author: igor.khosid
comment: [~phoebe.george] [~enricob] [~mahbubS]

1. PDF Zip File Name - incorrect, as per SOW should be "MVCU_BusinessLoan_archival_<MMDDYY>_<seg#>.zip.<seq#>" instead of "MvcuBusinessLoan_archival_112421_1.zip.001"
>>> missing "_" between MVCU_BusinessLoan  >>> see attached  [^IS-435_MVCU_incorrect zip file name.pdf] 
Please update SOW if the actual file name approved by client

2. Unable to validate index file name, not provided in the SOW , as of now index file is  "mvcuml4_index.txt"


author: igor.khosid
comment: [~phoebe.george] [~enricob] [~mahbubS]
As per SOW, Account number should be masked and Leaved last 4 digits  >>> see attached  [^IS-435_MVCU_mask account number.pdf] 
Mappings should be updated as well if needed


author: igor.khosid
comment: [~phoebe.george]
Please:
1. Attach approved samples
2. Request print samples for CA QA


author: mahbubs
comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid],

- You missed this line in SOW about account masking. Only paper option will have account masking. Not estatement and archival.

!image-2022-02-03-17-30-24-395.png!





*About pdf archival and index file naming convention:* The SOW is inconsistent. We escalated about this issue several times to Enrico and Phoebe. But we were advised to follow archival process of ms3 application.

Currently archival setup is similar to mvcums3 project. And the index file can be found inside the zip.001 file in this naming convention (*MvcuBusinessLoan_<MMDDYY>.idx*).



[~enricob] [~phoebe.george], please update the SOW so that archival specs become consistent.

Thanks


author: igor.khosid
comment: Hi [~mahbubS],
I do not think I missed that, I'm pointing to the print version. My understanding account number for the print should be masked
 !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! 


author: mahbubs
comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid],

Print options should be b/w like below-

!image-2022-02-03-21-41-10-411.png!



In your snap the statement is color. Check in which option you are testing.

Please update archival naming convention in SOW ... see previous comments

comment: [~mahbubS] [~Andrey.Kutsenko]

Sakib,
I am wondering if you had a chance to generate an invalid report? Please run it and provide the location.


author: mahbubs
comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid],

I generated invalid address report using a test data.

Please find the invalid address report in /z/infoftps3/mvcu/client_pickup/MVCU_loan_invalid_mail_address_12152021_1.csv.pgp

Please check.

Thanks


author: JIRAUSER11104
comment: [~mahbubS]Thank you

The naming convention for the invalid report is correct and according to SOW (see screenshot).
