title: ca-dds-pr-01:  Setup Microsoft SQL Database
description: [~hesham.hanna]: Per our Brisbane weekly meeting. Kent asked for you to install Microsoft SQL server since you have much more experience in this area. Also, I believe Kent mentioned to sync a copy of the Menlo DDS Database into this new ca-dds-pr-01 server.



[~kent.chan] and [~premraj.patil]: Just wanted to add this to Jira so the we do not lose sight. If there are specific specification you like to add, please do so.

comment: Hi Will

The server with SQl and DB is ready

Need ISIS , Vision to be installed or transferred from the old server

there is no online sync between old and new DB in BB and Melno as this may need higher SQL license

it is SQL DB backup from SQL DB Vision Menlo and restore it in BB SQL DB Vision server

comment: [~hesham.hanna] and [~kent.chan]: I'm not familiar with ISIS and Vision. Do we need to get Tina involved to get DDS to help us look into it?



Also, i tried logging in via database with username is_divert and it failed.



Is the database username & password synced from Menlo to Brisbane?

comment: [~hesham.hanna]: Per our spark message last friday, i confirmed i was able to log in via SQLDeveloper. I will close this ticket out for now.
