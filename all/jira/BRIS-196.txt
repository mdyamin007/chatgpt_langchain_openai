I created the rule, but in QA'ing the rule, I noticed that SSH was enabled before. check the "last login". It was good last friday. Are you sure you know what you need for this?

Per my note above "10.9.2.15 ({color:#de350b}you got most servers setup, but i think i forgot to ask for ca-isis-dv-01 & ca-rhstore-pr-01{color})"

I just tested ca-rhstore-pr-01 and it still does work:

Are you saying the ONLY access that doesn't work is ca-rhstore and ca-isis-dv to TX?

All others is ok?

ca-isis-dv-01 & ca-rhstore-pr-01 cannot ssh into 10.9.2.15 texas server.



Also, the following Brisbane servers:

ca-isis-pr-##

ca-isis-dv-01

ca-preproc-pr-##

ca-rhstore-pr-##



Need port 22 access to the following two Texas servers:

10.9.2.18

10.9.2.16

I manually tested all of them.



ca-isis-pr-03 works

ca-isis-pr-01 works

ca-isis-pr-02 works

ca-rhstore-pr-01 works

ca-preproc-pr-02 works

ca-preproc-pr-03 works

ca-isis-dv-01 works



Closing this ticket out.
