It looks like we are adding up not positive and negative totals, but their absolute values. Matt, could you please confirm that was the customer's intention? There has to be some business logic behind it.

comment: [~MattL],

I will be out until 9/1. Please let me know the correct logic and I'll update it when I am back. I currently took TS 30883 comment 45 logic and sum it up.


author: mattl
comment: Per the client on comment #66 of TS 30883:


Absolute Values should be what they're wanting.

comment: Hey [~jun]Can you look at the clients feed back on comment 72 of ticket 30883.

Comment 72 show that they are requesting other fields to be updated. I think we should keep this Jira focused on this update only. If not, please ask them to provide which fields those other fields should be using.
 - Update to add all the Payment detail Type="DUE" fields together (add two "due lines") and displayed sum value in summary section.

comment: it seems late charges do not match and the total does not add up on the bottom portion for this reason. Please see the screenshot below.
