comment: Hi [~MattL],

For the PDF archival index file spec, what should I use for field 7 doc type? Will "ARM Notice" be ok to use?


author: mattl
comment: [~jun]



That should be fine.

I didn't receive any mapping document. The only 2 fields that's required would be notice date on line 6 and account number on line 8. The rest of the notice is print as it is.

There is an issue with the verbiage so client corrected it and we're waiting for a test to be sent from FISERV. client does not have an ETA. I'm going to go ahead and place theEPIC ticket on hold. I suggest the stories be placed on hold as well.

The layout of the new test file is completely different than previous test file. I'm not sure how to format it since the previous file was print as it is. This new file might not be the correct test file.

comment: [~jun] [~MattL] The letter code in this index file dla_20210804_1_20211012_1617_necu.txt is 031, however apparently we already have a letter 031 tied to the description 'Mortgage Delinquency Notice'. There doesn't seem to be any letter 031 posted on production though, so perhaps we can just update the name. Can you confirm whether we should use a different letter code, or if I can just update the current name?


author: mattl
comment: Hi [~Shun.Kuwashima] [~jun]I beleive this letter should be 033.



031 is reserved for Mortgage Delinquency, which looks like was supposed to be a part of phase 2 which was never completed.

The ARM notice was originally listed as 033


author: jun
comment: [~MattL] [~Shun.Kuwashima],

I think we should use 031 for ARM notices which is next available letter code. We can let 033 be Mortgage Delinquency or another letter when the letter code gets to 033. It would be less confusing if we follow the next available letter code because we don't know when there will be more letters.


author: mattl
comment: [~jun]Agreed.



Also client has provided new file...Let me know if this one works.

comment: [~MattL] [~jun] Thanks, I've updated the enotice description for letter code 031 to ARM Notice on pilot and posted the index file. The description shows correctly on InfoTRAC pilot.
