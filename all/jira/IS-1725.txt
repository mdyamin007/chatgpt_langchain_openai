Client is concerned that it looks like these are separate words.

comment: Hi [~MattL]I checked the PDF sample provided plus double checked the code and there is no space between the 'd' and 'r' in the word 'withdrawn'. Please see screen shot below of sample provided, there is no space. I get the feeling this might be an issue with the pdf viewer they are using. I viewed the PDF via Chrome and Adobe and it looks fine on our end. Please see below.

Client approved samples.  They determined there was a pixelation issue on their side and there is no space.
