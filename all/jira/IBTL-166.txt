comment: [~rogelio_jira]: Can you re-test? This may be related to the bad RHS:/d/zip directory. I un-mounted and re-mount /d/zip directory.



Thanks!

comment: [~rogelio_jira]: Can you work with PC to confirm if insert is required? If so, they need to enter piece code in to Brisbane DataTRAC? Thanks!
