After this change, noticed that InfoTRAC didn't display any monthly statements, etax, enotice, etc.
Realized that the estmt_doc status, as well as others were set to '1'. In order for InfoTRAC to display the stmts/docs, the status need to be 'null' or '9'.

Ran below query to update all documents so they show for users:
update estmt_doc set status = null where esd_id in
(select esd_id
from estmt_doc
where acct_id in (
select acct_id
from fin_account
where acct_number in ('1706359832','1706359840','1706359858','1706359866','1706359874','1706359882','1706359890','1706359907','1706359915','1706359923','1706359931','1706359949','1706359957','1706359965','1706363685','1706363693','1706363700','1706363718','1706363726','1706363734','1706363742','1706363750','1706363768','1706363776'
)));
