hbvalue in sso test page has been updated. Submitting theform (
formURL: hblogin.jsp ) will do the work.

Thanks

comment: Verified on staging SSO/Admin console log errors and heartbeat changes, work correctly.

Note:

Did not verify console log error on enrollment steps, don't have hbvalue to verify.

Mamunur, let me know if I need it to complete verification.

They have only one step in enrollment. Go to the profile tab. Change delivery preference. Try to enroll again. You will then redirect to the enrollment step.

Thanks.
