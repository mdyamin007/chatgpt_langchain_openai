Hi Phoebe,

The file is in the format for doc processing, I posted this file on Pilot with doc processing and it works. Why is this file being posted with afp?

Hi Andrey,

Try posting the file with doc processing on staging.



Thanks,

Mac

Andrey, the file is being posted for enotice4, the file should be posted using *Doc Processing*, not Enotice4 Processing

comment: Thanks [~mac],
I carefully read the comments. 
And based on your comment yesterday, I realized that I need to post a *Doc Processing*.
However, I got an error when I went to the next step:
 !scr_error_doc_processing.png|thumbnail!

Hi Phoebe,

It looks like the file partially works as half of the postings were successful and the other wasn't. The ones that didn't work was because they didn't have the correct amount of data for that line.

Entry (15):

*Notice|PDF|006|whcudla_0000140269_06192022_e_00015.afp|whcudla_19_1_20220829_1219_0.zip|20220619|20220619|1|0000140269|NA||MICHAEL SARTORI||||||||*

Entry (16):
*Notice|PDF|006|whcudla_0_06192022_e_00016.afp|whcudla_19_1_20220829_1219_0.zip|20220619|20220619|1|0|NA|||||||*



Entry (15) was successful and Entry (16) wasn't. There are a good amount of lines like Entry(16) in that file which failed.



Can you please have client review?

Thanks,

Mac

comment: [~mac] This is an update that is transparent to the customer, since we are switching to the new index structure.

[~Tin.Chak] Can you help confirm how this should be handled?

Thanks!

comment: [~rumanb] [~rony] Can you take a look at the index file? A lot of records are incorrect. In addition to the record that Mac have commented on, there are records with leading 0's in the account number.

comment: Hi [~mac] 

Due to data file issue and a little bug in the dfa of letter 006, 007, empty pdf files were generated though a customer has no data within two anchor. Now I fixed those issues.

Here is the latest index file :[^dla_20220619_1_20220914_0003_whcu.txt]
Index file path :*/z/isd_input_dev/I3/process-files/whcu/dla_20220619_1_20220914_0003_whcu.txt*

Can we please try again to post the index file *dla_20220619_1_20220914_0003_whcu.txt*?
