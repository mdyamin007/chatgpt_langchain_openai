This is not an error from the Notification service or other API. It's Nexmo which has certain limits. We can increase the limit by contacting Nexmo. Or We need to slow down forcefully from the API side so that it doesn't send more SMS than Nexmo can handle at a time. But this way, performance will be slower a little bit

I don't believe we support long virtual number so that shouldn't be the issue. For the other one where we send 30 sms per second, we should already had the logic in place to prevent this. We have similar issue in 2020 and Naim confirmed that we have MQ for both eStatement and InfoReach's notification service that handle this. Can you double check with Naim on this.
