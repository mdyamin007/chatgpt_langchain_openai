comment: Hi [~jharvey]

Didn't notice this earlier but areFirst Mortgage Payoff Letter and 2nd Mortgage Payoff Letter will be in different application? One is for apcu daily letter notice and other is for non core notices? Just confirming.

If yes, I checked the current code fornon core notices and only letter code 304,306-314 is applicable. In the update sow, the info code is set as 007. Can you confirm if this correct? Also 001-006 are applicable per sow which makes us little confused by seeing current code because current non core notice codes doesn't h angle anything 001-006.



Here is the procedure file snapshot for non core.

can we use info code 315 instead of 007?

Thanks
