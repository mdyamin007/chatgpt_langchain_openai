Please review and confirm if it is ready for the client's review

[~barnetts]
1. Please update the due date
2. Due to the lack of QA resources, and the EOM, I suggest the end of the next week.

Since they messages are for month end, we are not able to do end of next week.

This one got dropped a few times (hence the rushed delay) but thankfully it is an easier update since we completed the same thing last month but with different verbiage.

Print samples requested from OPS.

Thanks, Barnett

comment: Hi [~misbah.uddin@dsinnovators.com] / [~Igor.Khosid] / [~Andrey.Kutsenko]

OPS has completed print samples.
Per Mike from OPS, on the 2 Visa requests, the perf line is printing almost 1/8 higher than the actual perf

Regarding comment https://jira.infoimageinc.com/browse/IS-1752?focusedCommentId=56031&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-56031we didn't make any changes regarding perf line. So I believe this is a printing issue.
