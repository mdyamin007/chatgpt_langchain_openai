comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] I've configured and ran the report on pilot, attached and named spcu_accumulative_paperless_report_101821.txt. Note that the actual accts in the file may not reflect production data since this was generated on pilot, however the filename and content format would be the same. 

One thing is that we actually can't configure this report to run once at EOM, we can only configure by a specific day. So the closest alternative currently would be to set it to run every month on the 28th (since the last day of month varies between months), or have it run on the 1st of each month at a very early time.

comment: Thank you [~Shun.Kuwashima]. Sample sent to the client.

Please schedule for the 1st very early in the morning.

comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima]- this is approved. Do we need to parallel test?

comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] Thanks, and no we do not need parallel. I will work on moving this update to stage today. I think I can actually release this to production as early as tmr, assuming I have the time. Of course, whether I release it tmr or next week would not matter   anyway since we want this to run on the 1st, but would that be ok if I release this sooner?

comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima]- Fine by me. Just please confirm when you do and the time that the report will be sent on the 1st so I can inform SPCU.

comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] I'm thinking to set this up at 1am on the 1st. 


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] I've released this and setup the schedule on production, the report should run/drop off to their client pickup location every month on the 1st around 1AM PST and send out an email to ITHost@thepolicecu.org.
