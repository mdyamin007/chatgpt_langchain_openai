Client did not approve samples. Please see their comment and attachments below.

T !TIS Correct Format.PNG!!TIS Incorrect Format.PNG! hank you for providing the sample. There are two things I noted: 1) The Effective Date is missing, and2) All of the rates should be formatted to two decimal places. Can you please provide this feedback to your development team? To help illustrate these two points, I have attached a TIS with the correct formatting in place, and attached the TIS sample with the issues highlighted.

Please see the request from the client below.



The formatting looks correct on the TIS included in these samples. I noticed the first two pages of the pdf did not pertain to the certificate TIS project but that is okay. Can we provide a our most recent rates in the data file format in order to produce a more recent batch of samples?

Which data file should I process?

Client wants us to new use rate file placed in their test folder to create samples from the data file for 03.06.22


author: JIRAUSER11101
comment: [~jharvey]

I will generate the sample today.

Please confirm the rate file naming convention.

The old naming convention for test isshel_cert_rates_MMDDYYYY.txt

The latest one from today:shel_cert_rates_031422.txt



Thanks

Client stated there was a mistake in their previous test rate file. They sentShel_cert_rates_031722.txt to their TEST folder to be used to create samples using the data file for 03/06/22.

Looks like the file naming convention is cert_rates_mmddyy.txt, please confirm that.

comment: Hey [~zhuoxinT],

I discussed with [~jharvey]for LIVE date.

Actually, the client did not request for early LIVE date. The client just need to know before release. So they can set their file up to transfer. Because if not, we won't receive it and get an error.

**** Please make sure contact with Joye, before releasing code. Do not release as in LIVE date. ****



Thanks,

Tun
