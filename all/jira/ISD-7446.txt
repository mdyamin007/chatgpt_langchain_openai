comment: [~kdishroon] Per my comment 25 on TS 29540, we need new logo files (preferably in PNG format since that is their current format). Please have them provide us new logos with the same dimensions as their current ones below:
* member site - 478 x 200
* admin  site - 228 x 100

Also the sample enrollment pdf that is shown during enrollment steps has the old logo, we will need IS to help us provide a new sample pdf with the new logo. I attached the current sample pdf for reference (fhnb_sample_statement_old.pdf).

comment: [~kdishroon] Did the client ever provide logo files for the e-sites? Also do you have any updates from IS on a new sample statement pdf to replace on the enrollment page when new users login?

comment: [~kdishroon] Yes, currently their admin site logo is b/w while their member site logo is colored so I can start testing with those.


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~kdishroon] My updates are all deployed onto pilot except for the sample enrollment pdf pending from IS. Ideally we should have one with dummy data similar to the old one I attached since every new user will see the sample pdf during enrollment.

comment: [~kdishroon] [~avannik] As mentioned in our meeting, Peter will let me know when we have an updated dummy sample pdf. Once that's provided, I'll roll that out to verify on pilot and then move this along with my other updates to stage for QA testing.

comment: Thanks Peter. I updated the pdf on pilot and verified it looks good, moved all my updates to stage for QA testing.

[~Igor.Khosid] [~avannik], this story consists of updating the name to "First Heroes National Bank" and also make logo updates on the e-sites. Please assist with verifying those site changes on stage admin and sso site. Instructions below:

1. Admin site
- Check logo is updated in the top left corner showing "First Heroes National Bank"

2. SSO - please test with cif 238194 for the user_fi_number field.
- Enrollment step1: Check sample enrollment pdf has new logo showing "First Heroes National Bank"
- Enrollment step2: Check enrollment disclosure has new name at bottom
- Complete enrollment steps and check home page has new logo at the top left corner.

Let me know if there are any questions or issues.
