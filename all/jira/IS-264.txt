description: Our Operations and Marketing teams have requested updated verbiage on eachour Dormancy Letters. The new letters are attached.

The individualdormancy datafiles are part of our Daily Notice file. Please let me know if you want me to zip and name the test files using the standard naming convention or it you want me to update the data files individually to TEST.



1. Following fourDormancy Notice data files for current production Dormancy NoticeDL-025.There are three New layouts in comment #1. The names are totally different.How do we know which data file for which layout?



Dormancy Notice (DL-25) in current production
monthlydormancy_mmddyyyy.csv
monthlydormancydorm-sav_mmddyyyy.csv
monthlydormancyInactiveChecking_mmddyyyy.csv
monthlydormancysharechoice_mmddyyyy.csv



New layouts to update (in comment #1)
dorm_youth-NEW.docx

dorm_IRA-NEW.docx

dorm_acct-NEW.docx 



2. The data fields in all current production Dormancy data files are the same. So the program combined all dormancy data files and use SAME layout. The fields in current data file are not the same with mapping in new layout (in comment #1).Are we going to get new test data files for those new layouts?



Fields in Data file
acctNbr|memberAgreeNbr|acct_type|date_last_contact|owner|firstname|line1|line2|cityName|stateCd|zipCd|del_method|PERS_ORG



--------------------Per Anessa------------------------------

The letter names have been updated to correspond with the data file name.

Yes, you can delete IS-211. We had to recreate the ticket because it was initially placed under IMP. This ticket now displays as AC. That's why you see two of the same.

comment: Hi Thomas,

Please use this IS-264 for this update, instead of IS-211.
