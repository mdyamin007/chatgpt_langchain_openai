Keri, do you have any updates from client?


author: kdishroon
comment: Le,

Per the client:

_"Thanks for clarifying on these and catching my mistakes. The top notice for the adverse action should have the Manhattan Beach Address. It looks like I missed that second address field on the form. :/_

_The loan billing notice should have the City of Industry address only. I also missed that the address was in two places on this form and was looking at the coupon portion only._

_So adverse action should only have Manhattan Beach and Loan coupon should only have City of Industry."_

Can you please make these changes and provide the DVPS so I can get these printed asap.

Thank you!

Keri

comment: [~lemoy28]: Per our conversation, now that you are back from Friday being OOO, please review [~kdishroon]'s comment above to make the minor adjustments.






author: kdishroon
comment: Hi Le,

On the Adverse action please have only the PO Box 10018 Manhattan Beach, CA 90267-7518 in both places.
 
 On the Loan billing notice the PO Box 60059 City of Industry, CA 91716 should show in both places.

No other notices need to be changed. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Thank-you,
