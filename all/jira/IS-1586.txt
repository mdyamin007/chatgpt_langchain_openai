Total = 3hrs

UPDATED TIMELINE:

Turnover = 9/20

Sample to QA = 9/22 before 1pm PST

Sample to Client = 9/23

Client Approval = 9/26

Parallel = 9/26

Live Date = 9/30

Assigned to you since I didn't see Chad on list. Wilson is working with Gabriel on providing final pdf so we may need to push timeline back, thanks!


author: rodriguez
comment: [~Bryanl]Thanks, and no problem, I'll wait for Wilson and Gabriel to finish up and I will provide a new timeline then. In the meantime I will go over e-forms with Chad

comment: Hi [~rodriguez]

Per Wilson:

The back is set to use the same color as the sample provided by the customer. 89% Cyan and 70% Magenta.

Please note the back is not the file provided by the customer. Our existing file was updated to reflect the changes. Please have the customer go through and approve.



Please provide new timeline and let me know if you want client to approve color scheme before continuing, thanks!


author: rodriguez
comment: [~Bryanl]Lets have them approve the color scheme first, ask them if the blue in the backer should match the blue in the first page of Wilson's sample. Currently they are the same in production. In Wilson' s sample they are different and I get the feeling that is not what PROV may want. Once we get approval from client on color scheme, I will provide a new timeline.


author: bryanl
comment: Hi [~rodriguez]

Per client:

Just use the same color as on the current backer (Navy Blue) please.

Please provide new timeline, thank you!


author: rodriguez
comment: [~Bryanl]New timeline below, just a note, if Wilson gets the color done before 9/26, I will modify timeline:

Turnover (after Wilson has generated color matched PDF ) = 9/26

Sample to QA = 9/28 before 1pm PST

Sample to Client = 9/29

Client Approval = 10/3

Parallel = 10/4 (AFTER EOM)

Live Date = 10/10

Dev = Chad

NOTES TO DEV:

Please update prisma ticket (provml1.TIC) & (test_provml1.TIC) with new pdf backer. Please see Leo for further instructions.

Wilson has provided updated PDF which I have attached to Jira and removed previous version, please provide modified timeline. Thank you!

comment: [~Bryanl] the print samples are scanned. Please provide them to the client for review if needed. 


author: bryanl
comment: Hi [~rodriguez]

Per client feedback:

Corrections/Changes:

1. Please have the URL for MyProvident.com that is listed under Branch Payments be on one line and not wrap as it is in the example.

2. Capitalized headings under Additional Payment Information and General Information should all end with a '.', or '-', or ':'.

3. Also want to confirm that the perforation for the coupon (front) and address change (back) line up when the stub is detached.

Thank you!


author: rodriguez
comment: [~Bryanl]For corrections 1 & 2, that is how it came in the PDF provided. We cannot manipulate the text within the PDF. That is something the bank needs to correct. All we can do is color match the PDFs. Only person that may be able to change is Wilson.

[~Igor.Khosid]will need to verify number 3 as I do not have access to print samples.



Thanks,

Leo

comment: Hi [~rodriguez]

Per client:

Just a few more tweaks. Sorry we didn't catch them on the first pass. Please see the highlighted areas on the attachment "STATEMENT BACKER-#2--9-29-22 Client Request Changes.pdf". The "add space" message refers to a space between the check box and the wording. Let me know if any of the others do not make sense. Thanks!


author: rodriguez
comment: Hi [~Bryanl], these modifications will need to be made by Wilson. One thing I wanted to sure wouldn't be an issue is the centering of the address since this portion is mailed back to bank via CRE. I checked with Gabriel and he confirmed that the PROV loans CRE does NOT contain a window, therefore centering the address as requested shouldn't be an issue. FYI [~Igor.Khosid].

Thanks,
Leo
