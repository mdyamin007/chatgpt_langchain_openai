title: MSBK - [31291][pvt] Account Purge Request
description: -------------------per Joye----------------------------------

MSBK would like to know if we are able to combine their request for an account list that has not had any activity in 24 plus months with the account purge setup. They would like to have the report created, them validate it, then us use it to purge the accounts in our system. They would like to setup the purge as an ongoing process but only whenever they send a file, not on a set time frame. They anticipate this to happen approximately once a year, when they do an acquisition or merger, but they don't have a concrete timeline.

The client is requesting a couple things:
 * Generate a list of all accounts who do not have any statements/notices/taxes dated in the past 24 months
 * Once client validates it, they want us to setup the purge account process in order to purge the list of accounts as well as moving forward around once every year.



I was thinking 3 hours for each item, totaling to 6 hours altogether for setup/testing. Although there is no code change/server restart necessary, I think we should give more time since it involves multiple parts and also client validation in the middle of it. I provided a tentative timeline below, let me know if the assessment should be adjusted.
