title: 41494 / 6324 - VWCU - Setup enrollment file process
description: VWCU would like to set up an enrollment file process.

This is the processing-ui/com.infoimage.processing/application/paperless process.

Will have to set up the handler and registrar, and add CID into the factory.



Key things to pay attention to, is VWCU is now using symXchange as well, so we will need symXchange logic applied to this code so that when changes are made to the notification_preference table and paperless table records are created onto the symxchange table as well.



Let me know if you have any questions. Thank you

Can you provide me a sample index file? If not, can you tell me what columns/values will be there so that I can work on the handler and registrar file? And if there is any additional logic, let us know.

Thanks,
Rifat

The sample index file has been added.

Besides adding the SymXchange logic to keep the SymXChange table in sync with the changes to any records in the delivery preference table, and paperless table. There isn't anything special.



Thanks!

I have completed the task. But as per our meeting today with David, he has asked us to make it a standardized process for all the clients who will use symxchange. I can provide the updated code by next Tuesday.  

A few notes -
1. The file you provided, the name was _enrollment_vwcu_09132019_, but the code doesn't support that as the file name has to start with a prefix. So the file name format I am using is _ms1_enrollment_vwcu_10142019_.
2. Leading zeros are not supported as it wasn't supported in vwcu auth handler.
3. I am setting old_value of symxchange_log table as "NA" for a new notification_preference insert, as there isn't any old value present.

let me know if these points are okay.

Thanks

The points you've made are all okay. Feel free to make the changes you need to get it standardized, and this is a one time run, so you can modify the file as you need.

Thanks

The backend file has been uploaded in your ftp server along with the conf file. Please find it under the name "DSI_128_VWCU_Setup_enrollment_file_process_15102019.zip.pgp". Please let me know if the results are expected.

Thanks,
