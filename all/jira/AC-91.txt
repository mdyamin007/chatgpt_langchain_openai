title: SSCU [20165] [pvt] HELOC tag ZZ055 update [fast track] /  Non-Billable- Waived
description: SSCU - HELOC tag ZZ055 update
*App:* Heloc

*Description*: Update the tag ZZ055 to show a true "00-00-00" and leave the other logic as is?
If not, the suggested logic below will work.
When 00-00-00 is received for the "Payment Due date",update programming as follow:
Calculate"Payment Due date" to be the next month from "Billing Date" in MM/05/YYYY format.
For example, "Billing Date" is 05/10/2021, then "Payment Due Date" will be 06/05/2021.
If "Billing Date" is month of December, then month will be 01 and year will be next year.
For example,"Billing Date" is 12/10/2021, then "Payment Due Date" will be 01/05/2022.

Acct:
Per Gary Marshall comment # 38, "Yes, I agree to waive the programming fee as long as they correct the punctuation going forward."
