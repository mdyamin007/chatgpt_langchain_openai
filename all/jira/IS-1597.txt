As mentioned in the emails regarding this issue, this application won't be able to start until sometime in October so the due date of 9/30 won't be met.

QA checklist:[^qa_check_list_apcuml5_updates.pdf]

DPVS attached:[^apcuml5112.print]
 Print pages 1-12 from "apcuml51124.2o1.afp"

Note: This update required a script to be created as the previous script didn't allow changes to the subject line for the DPVS email so print samples and parallel will check to ensure everything is still working correctly.

The updates made also noted in the QA checklist include
 - the email subject line updated to "APCU Mortgage - Denial Statement DPVS for cycle ## is ready
 attached screenshot: !apcu updated subject line screenshot.PNG|thumbnail!
 - app type update from "LN" to "Mortgage Stmt of Denial"
 attached screenshot: !apcu invalid address report apptype update.PNG|thumbnail!
 - I've also attached screenshots to ensure other functions are still working as it did before such as the email for the invalid address report and the log file that shows that the counts match. These functions used to be in the apcuml5_redtitan.control file and have been moved into the apcuml5_process.sh script

For the DPVS email subject line, I didn't see where the client confirmed the specific subject line mentioned in the description, so I matched their invalid address email subject line.
Can you confirm with the client if the subject line "APCU Mortgage - Denial Statement DPVS for cycle ## is ready" is okay to use?

I have also added the update in their invalid address reports, as the client mentioned in the team support ticket. From my comment above the apptype changed from "LN" to "Mortgage Stmt of Denial"

comment: [~kericapote] - any updates from the client?

Please create a masterparallel to ensure that everything is still working correctly as the script was redone for the email subject line update.
