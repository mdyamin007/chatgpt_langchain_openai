title: Mapping balance value in the letters' headers - confirmation would be great
description: There are 2 instances in the letters where some balance is shown: in the header and under the table.

 The mapping files instruct to use {color:#0747a6}<CurrentPrinBalance>{color} field for both values. But at the end of July it was communicated that:

{color:#de350b}_Currently the letters are pulling the highlighted number from current balance where they need to be pulling from projprinbalance. For both letters:_{color}

And pieces of the under the table text were attached for the illustration:

The understanding was that the source for the balance should be modified to {color:#0747a6}<ProjPrinBalance>{color} in the letter, including the header.

However, the customer never told us explicitly to use {color:#0747a6}<ProjPrinBalance>{color} in the header.The samples were approved with numbers, which are not easily distinguishable. To be on the safe side, I would not mind to know for sure.

comment: Hi [~zhuoxinT]

Client has responded the following regarding this 'PrintBalance' question;
 * _Thanks for the update. Looking at the data. The Principal Balance in the header needs to be CurrentPrinBalance and the balance under the table needs to be ProjPrinBalance. Sorry for any confusion. Let me know if this makes sense._

Please proceed with the necessary updates. I will also leave a comment on the IS story

Thank you,
Juliana
