comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] [~nischala.manjunath] Pending confirmation from EQBK on approval.

[~nischala.manjunath] Peter let me know that you will be OOO. If I get approval while you're out, what is the soonest date that you can provide for QA? I just want to finalize a timeline as well.


author: nischala.manjunath
comment: [~phoebe.george] - I'll be back on 05/23. Thanks!


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~nischala.manjunath] We were having some issues getting BRIL access to the pilot, but completed that this morning. We should be getting approvals today if you are able to begin preparing on your end. I will provide an update later this morning. Thanks!


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~nischala.manjunath] BRIL submitted an update to the e-form for this setup. I'm pending approval on the changes that Wilson has made and will forward to you. Other than that, the PDF eStmt test data looks good. I'll send it once done.

I will update the due date to 6/17 as a placeholder for now since the original due date has passed, but will confirm with you once received.

Thanks,

Phoebe


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~nischala.manjunath] I have attached the new e-form to be used with the updated logo/return address. Please update and provide a new eStatement PDF when ready for final approval by the customer and/or new index file for posting. Thank you!

[~Ricky Lopez] FYI

Please
1. Provide index file to process on stage
2. Wondering if the all new resources provided to and uploaded by ISD? 


author: igor.khosid
comment: [~phoebe.george] - please call when you have  a sec


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~nischala.manjunath] Can you confirm what the input file name that you're expecting for the BRIL DDA file? Just want to confirm if it is identical to EQBK's current file name with just the 'BRIL' updated for the CID. Thanks!


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~nischala.manjunath] This is the EQBK file name, so we will be mirroring for BRIL DDA to use:

BRIL_DDA_<MMDDYYYY>.DAT
