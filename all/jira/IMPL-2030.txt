title: SNFB - Guardian ARM Notices - TS28583 Update to process additional data file EXT0773 - LIVE 5/13
description: Update code to process an additional data file named: snfb.prod.EXT0773.yymmdd.XXXX.pgp. This file may be sent occasionally when Black Knight has to send a file manually. It is possible to get this file at the same time or on the same day as the current EXT0774 data file. BK confirmed the files are identical in format and data to the EXT0774 files so this should not affect our processing/output. 

Timeline:
Turnover to IS 5/2 (with test file)
QA sample 5/4
Client sample 5/5
Client approval 5/9
Parallel 5/10
LIVE 5/13

*6/9 - Update *- Client does not expect to send a 0773 file. However, InfoIMAGE proposes to put a safety net so if this file is sent, the print program will send out an unidentified file email so the client can let us know how to proceed at that time.
