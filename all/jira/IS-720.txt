Did this need parallel before going live today? Not sure if QA reviewed this as it was missed on IS-862 too and this is planned to go live with it.

comment: Hi [~Bryanl]

QA still not reviewed it yet. this did not need parallel. but IS-862 needed parallel.

Hello IS-862 has passed parallel with TXOPs, please release code for this along with IS-862 ASAP as this was supposed to be live 3/30. Thank you!
