comment: Hi [~kdishroon],

I don't see any logo on the FHNB-Letter - Annual FMV Letters (fmv). Can you please advise?

Thanks,

comment: Hi [~Tevis Mak],

You are correct, there is no logo, however, anywhere that says Fort Hood National Bank, it needs to be changed to First Heroes National Bank.

Thank you,

Keri


author: JIRAUSER11401
comment: Hi [~kdishroon],

The only place that shows the bank name is came from data file. So I don't think there is anything I can work on for this letter (FCSBFMC.dfa). Should I skip this and continue with other letters? 

Thanks,
Tevis


author: kdishroon
comment: Hi [~Tevis Mak] - Yes, please skip the FMV and continue with the other letters.

Per our DM on Zoom, here is the spreadsheet with inactive letters highlighted in blue [^Copy of Infoimage NewChg Notice Spreadsheet (006).xlsx]

Please noted that no update is needed for two of the letters.
- dnx letter 042 is no longer used so that no update is needed
- Annual FMV Letters (fmv) - FCSBFMV.dfa, there is no logo on it so there is no update needed.

comment: Hi [~Tevis Mak] - There are two more PDF notices that will need to have the LOGO updated; the ESCHEAT and DISPUTE. Initially I was told that the client would need to update these on their end, however, when the client sent test files (see ticket 31474), the logo was not updated in the samples we sent back. It turns out that the process removes the logo and address and adds the logo and address back in to make sure it is positioned correctly. The image resource will need to be updated to use the new logo. 

Please update the logos for these letters as well and provide samples.

Thank you!

Keri Y.

Do you know what is the letter code for those two letters?

Thanks, 
Tevis


author: kdishroon
comment: Hi [~Tevis Mak],

Actually, I think [~jasonV] is working on the Dispute notices, those are letter code 029. The Escheat is 412.

I created a new parallel since FCSBDL042 is no longer needed.

- The bank name on the last page couldn't be updated because it is an insert page by pseg. We will need client to provide a new pseg in order to update it.
