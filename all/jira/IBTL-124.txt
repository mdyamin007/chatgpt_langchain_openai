comment: [~rogelio_jira]: Sorry it was a permission issue!  I had to ask Prem late last night to recreate /d/ partition and I forgot to change permission.  We only had 229GB of data and he increased it to 4TB.

I tested it the permission and it works:

[~rogelio_jira]: Can you use the Aug 31 cycle as indicated in brisbane production list:

comment: [~Tin.Chak]: Can you confirm the "Processed Before" error is valid? Was it recently created from our Brisbane testing or was it before. If it is before our Brisbane testing, we may need to remove it so that we can re-test via Brisbane instead of the old Menlo job.

Please re-assign either to us when you have your findings. Thanks!

comment: Processed before is valid error. The records were posted before the Brisbane testing. I'm going to repost this particular WECU job for another test that I was going to do. If you post job from Sept EOM, it will go through without issue because the database weren't synced up to that point yet.


author: william.kong
comment: [~Tin.Chak]: Per our spark message. Thank you for undo-ing the old cycle. I will ask Rogelio to re-run to ensure the processing is smooth.



[~rogelio_jira]: Can you please reprocess all the steps again just to make sure all the steps run flawlessly w/o issues.

comment: The search index failed because the document have not been posted yet.

The document job failed to post because the zip file was not found:

comment: [~TunA]: Can you help research this issue? We ran the job a few times. But this time around, the eStatement zip files did not get copied over to /d/isd_input/ indiv_afp/wecu/afp-archive/wecums1-20200831/ folder.



I checked thewecums11319.log logs and I don't see any error messages.



I do see the zip files get created in:

comment: Hi Rogelio,

I could not find the reason why the zip files did not copy to/d/isd_input/indiv_afp/wecu/afp-archive/wecums1-20200831/.

Most of script calling commands go to your Putty screen (instead of log files). Do you still have that processing Putty Window?

If yes, please mail to me.

If not, please reprocess 'n' option and email the Putty screen.

Thanks,

Tun

For some reason, following move command in "/home/master/afp_zip_mover_threads.pl in line 412" is not working.

*move*("${afp_dir}/threading_folder_${thread_number}/${zip_naming}_${thread_number}.zip", "$output_dir");



*This is command showing on putty screen, when process:*

in /home/master/afp_zip_mover_threads.pl moving /d/wecu/wecums1-indiv/threading_folder_1/wecums1_31_1_20201020_1609_1.zip to /d/isd_input/indiv_afp/wecu/afp-archive/wecums1-20200831/



In 10.4.20.40, I created test scriptjust for move command. But the file still cannot move. I copied test script to your folder to review. "/d/share/william/test.pl in10.4.20.40"

Do you think it is network connection issue? I am not sure how other jobs are working.

Thanks,

The GID we are using is:

[oper1@rhs2 afp-archive]$ grep opers /etc/group
 opers:x:{color:#de350b}*300*{color}:neil,rayL,mimi,oper1,rogelio,jason,cesar,alexW,jeffK,oper2,opertest,apham,garyG,glennG,kennyH,sachitaB,wilsonN



Also, i would suggest to sync up oper1 user to be:

[oper1@rhs2 afp-archive]$ grep oper1 /etc/passwd
 oper1:x:{color:#de350b}*543*{color}:300::/home/oper1:/bin/bash



This needs to be applied to all of the folders in isd_input/indiv_afp & isd_input/I3/process-files/
