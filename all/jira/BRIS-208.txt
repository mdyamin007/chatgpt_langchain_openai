title: InfoREACH MongoDB Access
description: Kent,

We need cross access between Menlo's Mongo and BB's Mongo so that we can setup BB's Mongo to the same cluster. This way we will have data sync automatically to the BB. If this exercise is good, we will do the same for other eStatement Mongo as well and will send separate ticket for access.

Please open the following port between both set.

*Menlo*:
 # [inforeach-mongo01.infoimageinc.com|http://inforeach-mongo01.infoimageinc.com/]
 # [inforeach-mongo02.infoimageinc.com|http://inforeach-mongo02.infoimageinc.com/]
 # [inforeach-01.infoimageinc.com|http://inforeach-01.infoimageinc.com/]

*BB*:

 ca-mongoir-pr-01

 ca-mongoir-pr-02

 ca-mongoir-pr-03

*Port*: 22, 2701



Thanks

David

We are being able to access the BB mongo set from Menlo set. We need the access Menlo servers from BB servers as well.

*BB*:

 ca-mongoir-pr-01

 ca-mongoir-pr-02

 ca-mongoir-pr-03

*Menlo*:
 # [inforeach-mongo01.infoimageinc.com|http://inforeach-mongo01.infoimageinc.com/]
 # [inforeach-mongo02.infoimageinc.com|http://inforeach-mongo02.infoimageinc.com/]

I might not have specify this but can you open access to both direction, from Menlo to BB and from BB to Menlo. I will update ticket BRIS 209 as well.

Thanks
David

For Menlo, there is only two inforeach-XX servers, 01 and 02. For BB, there is only two ca-mongoir-pr servers, 01 and 02. Access given accordingly

I validated Inforeach-01->27017->ca-mongoir-pr-01 works

I validated the reverse access:

What exactly are you asking for?

comment: Hi [~kent.chan] / [~davidt],

I understand we are getting closer to the moving date and we do not want to waste any of your time. What I asked is pretty straight forward, not sure how we are confusing you. From [my requirement comment|#comment-14292] ,

*:: Requirement 1 ::*

*We want to be able to access all of the destination mongo servers in menlo from each of the source app servers in BB*

*Source:*
 ca-inforeach-pr-01 (Brisbane)
 ca-inforeach-pr-02 (Brisbane)
 ca-inforeach-pr-03 (Brisbane)
 ca-inforeach-pr-04 (Brisbane)
 
 
 *Destination*:
 inforeach-mongo01 (Menlo)
 Port: 27017
 
 inforeach-mongo02 (Menlo)
 Port: 27017
 
 inforeach-01 (Menlo)
 Port: 27017



-------------------------------------------------------------------


 *:: Requirement 2 ::*

*We want to be able to access all of the following destination mongo servers in BB from each of the following source app servers in Menlo*

*Source:***
 inforeach-01 (10.8.9.114)
 inforeach-02 (10.8.9.115)
 inforeach-03 (10.8.9.207)
 inforeach-04 (10.8.9.208)
 
 *Destination*:
 ca-mongoir-pr-01 (10.4.24.205)
 Port: 27017
 
 ca-mongoir-pr-02 (10.4.24.206)
 Port: 27017

ca-mongoir-pr-03 (10.4.24.207)
 Port: 27017



-------------------------------------------------------------------



I think you *missed requirement 1*.

!Screenshot from 2020-10-23 15-35-52.png|width=771,height=173!



*For requirement 2*, you said in the [your comment|#comment-14294] that "_there is only two inforeach-XX servers, 01 and 02. For BB, there is only two ca-mongoir-pr servers, 01 and 02._" In my [later comment|#comment-14324] I provided the server name and their IPs to let you know *inforeach-03,inforeach-04 andca-mongoir-pr-03 exists*.

Following are the 4 servers*from Menlo*.

inforeach-01 10.8.9.114

inforeach-02 10.8.9.115

*inforeach-03 10.8.9.207*

*inforeach-04 10.8.9.208*



Following are the 3 mongo servers*from BB*

ca-mongoir-pr-01 10.4.24.205

ca-mongoir-pr-02 10.4.24.206

*ca-mongoir-pr-03 10.4.24.207*

thank you much for the clarification...apologies for the confusion, there are so many tickets and requests right now, that one somehow was not clear.



I have added and tested the rules requested. Should all be working now

comment: Hi Kent,

Thanks! *Requirement 1* is working perfectly, that means all the app servers in BB are being able to access menlo mongo servers.



For requirement 2, as mentioned in my previous comment, *inforeach-03, inforeach-04 and ca-mongoir-pr-03 exists*, so please apply the rules to them as per the *Requirement 2*from my previous comment.

Following are the issues..

- Not being able to access *ca-mongoir-pr-03* from *inforeach-01*

 !Screenshot from 2020-10-23 19-41-02.png|width=707,height=155!

- Not being able to access *ca-mongoir-pr-03* from *inforeach-02*

!Screenshot from 2020-10-23 19-24-36.png|width=714,height=130!

- Not being able to access *ca-mongoir-pr-01,**ca-mongoir-pr-02 and**ca-mongoir-pr-03* from *inforeach-03***

*!Screenshot from 2020-10-23 19-24-59.png|width=722,height=143!*

- Not being able to access ** *ca-mongoir-pr-01,**ca-mongoir-pr-02 and**ca-mongoir-pr-03* from *inforeach-04*****
