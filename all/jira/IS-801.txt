comment: Hi [~thomasY],

I noticed that the date is missing. Can you please advise is is due to the date field [NEXT_PMT_DUE_DATE] being blank? 

Thanks, Barnett 


author: thomasy
comment: [~barnetts]Yes, a blank date means it's missing from data

comment: [~barnetts]I cannot find those accounts in the latest production file.

comment: [~barnetts]: Since this is still pending approval, we will put the other UTCU project on hold until we get this approved as well so that we can release it together. Please advise if you have any questions or concerns.

Thanks, Barnett 


author: thomasy
comment: [~barnetts]I will need to revert all the changes from the cancelled Jira first


author: barnetts
comment: Thank you [~thomasY]


author: william.kong
comment: [~thomasY]: Per our conversation, you will target to get the code synced up. Once completed, we will revisit a new timeline for the final QA and release date.


author: barnetts
comment: [~William.Kong]/[~thomasY],

Can you please provide a new timeline?

Thanks, Barnett

comment: [~William.Kong] [~barnetts] [~thomasY] [~Jessica]
I hope somebody will explain why:
1. The descriptions are updated after the client approves the samples?
Do we need to test it again?
2. Why is the story turned over to QA, no PR ID provided, and the project is not in the QA folder?
>>>
I'm reverting the story to the "In progress" status.
Please provide the required for testing information corresponding with the story status.
- IS checklist
 - PR ID
 - Export project into the QA folder
 - DPVS
 - Request the print samples

[~Andrey.Kutsenko] - FYI
