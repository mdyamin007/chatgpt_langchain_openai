+*GitLab:*+
 * Download Latest InfoSYNC "BRIS-5" Branch and run the docker instance



*+How to run this container:+*

After you unzip, go into theInfoSYNCunzipped folder:

To build 'image', run the following command:
 * docker-compose build

To create 'container' run the following command (Note: -d option runs as daemon; If you don't use-d, it is ok, but if you hit Ctrl+C, it will stop).
 * docker-compose up -d



However, you will need to modify the docker-compose.yml to configure a few arguments:
{code:java}
version: '3.0'
services:
 infosync:
 image: infosync_bris5_img
 build: ./
 container_name: infosync_bris5
 restart: always
 ports:
 - 9090:80
 volumes:
# You will need to get this app.cfg file from attachment and update the following line to point to this file.
 - "/Users/william/Downloads/infosync-BRIS-5/app.cfg:/var/www/config/app.cfg:ro"
# Please use your own id_rsa file belonging to the RHS account you are connecting to trigger the global isis_scan.sh
 - "/Users/william/Downloads/infosync-BRIS-5/ftpscanner.cfg:/var/www/config/ftpscanner.cfg:ro"
 - "/Users/william/Downloads/infosync-BRIS-5/id_rsa:/id_rsa:ro"{code}


+*Configuration:*+
 * As mentioned above, please update docker-compose.yml described in the comments lines above.
 * Update ftpscanner.cfg file which should be located inside the container under the same /config folder as app.cfg. This is the configuration files for the scanner. Update the ftpscanner config to match what you are testing (e.g. update the test.sh script to your your testing script name.. e.g. /home/shailendraR/my_isis_test_scan.sh)
