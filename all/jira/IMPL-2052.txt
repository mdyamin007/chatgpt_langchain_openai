title: SSCU - [29148] [pvt] Loan Bills: Change Days in Billing Cycle (LOC template)
description: Update program/coding to create a Billing Date table based on the following:

Billing Date:
5/6/22-6/5/22 will use 31 Days in Billing Cycle
6/6/22-7/5/22 will use 30 Days in Billing Cycle
7/6/22-9/5/22 will use 31 Days in Billing Cycle

If the Billing Date field is within the date range indicated above, hard code the value under the Days In Billing Cycle.  This hard-code logic applies to Print, eStatement & PDF Archival.  When this job is approved, we may modify the table above to start on the date of the code release. If Fiserv is able to fix the data, we can update the last table to reflect the date that Fiserv can release their data changes accordingly. Otherwise, we will need to adjust the table to extend past 9/5/22 if necessary.


IS hours and dates:

 Programming Hours:   2 Hours
Code Start Date:  05/20/2022
Sample Date:   05/23/2022
Approval Date: 05/24/2022
