Assessment Details (IS):
 - Parallel required: No
 - Recategorize the Money Market Wealth Builder Account Type 1200 from Checking to Savings on Statements. Change to take place in two areas:
 1) Move this information to the Savings section so it displays: Savings: 1200 - Money Market Wealth Builder
 2) Move the account totals in the ACCOUNT SUMMARY table from CHECKING to SAVINGS.

-Only format program needs to be updated. Currently if category is "Checking" it will go to checking section. I'm guessing they want to ignore that if the id is 1200.
 - Example of statement with that account type in TS #22997 Comment #1
