description: {color:#555555}From Client on 9/16:
 
 Good Morning Andrea and Gary,
 
 Now that we are live and have a few production files on the books I am looking into creating a process for our credit union to easily collect statistics from the Job Tracking tab to reconcile against invoices received from InfoImage. Is it possible to get a report from InfoImage on a monthly basis that shows the paper and estatement production statistics that appear on the CSV files from this tab in one report? At this point it requires us to download each csv file, pull the statistics from each file and then validate the totals on the invoices. When I did this for the jobs produced in August I had to download and review 65 different CSV files. This will be a cumbersome long-term process.
 
 Please let me know if this is feasible and if this something you have available for your other clients.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Katie{color}
