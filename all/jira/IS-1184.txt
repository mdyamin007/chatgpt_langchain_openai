comment: [~rodriguez]-I was able to verifiy only 104 and 106 letters, and I was able to verify only the PDF is available to user.I was not able to compare as I don't have approved sample PDF to compare.I was not able to verify other letter codes as I don't see the accounts posted in the index file provided for testing in stage
