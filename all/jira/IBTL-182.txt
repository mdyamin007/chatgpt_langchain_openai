Hi Team,



Peter, Le and YaMee reported issue this morning. So, Im going to consolidate the steps to do on the rhs server:



*Step #1:* 



Youre your ~/.bash_profile, go ahead and delete the following two lines:

export CVSROOT="10.8.9.40:/extra/is_cvs"

export CVS_RSH=ssh



*Step #2:*

Rename & backup your current cvs folder and create a new cvs folder:



mv ~/cvs ~/cvs_backup

mkdir ~/cvs



*Step #3:*

Logout of your ssh session and relogin



*Step #4:*

Run the following command:

echo $CVSROOT; echo $CVS_RSH



You should see the following response. If not, please inform me:





*Step #5:*

Do you normal check in/out process. If it does not work, please inform me.

comment: Hi [~William.Kong]

Looks like we don't have permission for port 22 on ca-rcs-pr-01.infoimageinc.com server from our dsi server. Can you please open this port?

comment: [~premraj.patil]: Thanks Prem!

I ran:

[root@dsi ~]# echo > /dev/tcp/10.4.20.24/22 && echo "Port is Open"
Port is Open



and it looks to be opened.



[~tohidulI]: Can you please re-test and let me know if it works?

[~tohidulI]: Can you give me another example? the WECUMS31.dfa file does not exist. I did add your key to ca-rcs-pr-01 server to hopefully correct the issue mentioned above. Please re-assign back to me with your feedback.
