comment: Hi [~Shun.Kuwashima],

Here is index file for pilot:

ea2_20211020_1_20211102_0838_mvcu.txt


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: Hi [~jun], I tried posting that index file but I'm seeing this error:
java.lang.Exception: Can't find the version ID=99999 in pc's database (tblal table)

This usually means there is something wrong with the DT_JOB_ID or that it's not created. Not too sure if PC needs to be involved. Can you look into it? Thanks

comment: [~jun] [~phoebe.george] Per my discussion with Jun, I am able to view statements on pilot from within this index file instead: ea2_20211020_1_20211130_1451_mvcu.txt
Example accts: 214235372, 214854103, 316220411
