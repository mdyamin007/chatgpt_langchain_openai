title: SPCU - [22727][pvt] Recategorize the Money Market Wealth Builder Account Type 1200 from Checking to Savings on Statements (both Section and ACCOUNT SUMMARY
description: IS Assessment
 =============
Hours for development: 3 IS hours + ISD hours not required
Turnover Date : 10/13/2021
Sample Date: 10/25/2021
Sample Approval Date: 10/27/2021
Go live date : 10/28/2021

Assessment Details (IS):
 - Parallel required: No
 - Recategorize the Money Market Wealth Builder Account Type 1200 from Checking to Savings on Statements. Change to take place in two areas:
 1) Move this information to the Savings section so it displays: Savings: 1200 - Money Market Wealth Builder
 2) Move the account totals in the ACCOUNT SUMMARY table from CHECKING to SAVINGS.

 - Only format program needs to be updated. Currently if category is "Checking" it will go to checking section. I'm guessing they want to ignore that if the id is 1200.
 - Example of statement with that account type in TS #22997 Comment #1
 (Sample_E-statements_with_1200 Money Market Wealth Builder.pdf )

I believe the new logic - looks good.
However, please check and confirm - see below.
In the Account Summary section, your samples show "*IRA*" but one of the old samples I got from the TS (TS #22997 Comment #1) - is "*IRA DEPOSIT"*. I am wondering if this is OK?

comment: [~thomasY]and [~Igor.Khosid], SPCU approved but they want to see a sample set with more S1200 account types. I asked SPCU if they could provide some account numbers to generate additional samples.

In the meantime, can we proceed/prepare for code release?

Thanks

comment: [~dyuen]Just want to clarify, by account type 1200, it is referring to account types 1200-1299?


author: dyuen
