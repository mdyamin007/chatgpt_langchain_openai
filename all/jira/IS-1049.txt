 Per my message to Enrico,I tested out the new data file on redtitan, but noticed that the quality of the new pdf is not as good as the old one. Can you ask if the client can send a better quality pdf because in comparison to the first one its very blurry. Please provide a new pdf that is a text based pdf. The new one is just graphics and after looking at the pdf on adobe, it can't read the text.

 Sample has been attached:[^apcuml5_SAMPLE.pdf]using the provided pdf file in[^apcu_Mort_Stmt_Of_Denial_032122.zip]



As mentioned in a previous comment, Enrico provided a new test file that had a date of 050422 and upon testing in redtitan, the pdf text was unable to be detected. This pdf was blurry and wasn't text based compared to the pdf in the attached 032122 zip file. Since a new readable pdf wasn't provided before sample date, the one originally attached to this ticket with date 032122 is being used for samples. Please ensure that the zip files provided by the client will contain a text based pdf that is readable for redtitan.

comment: [~Natalie.Tom] samples approved. APCU says:

Yes, we received confirmation today, that management is ok moving forward with the process as it is. The samples were a little lower res, but are still very readable at normal sizes.
 The samples are approved, thank you!

comment: Client is checking with their vendor on producing Bulk PDFs with embedded fonts. They saw that it was possible with the 3/21 data file, so we will wait until they send us a new test file.

comment: [~enricob] [~Natalie.Tom] we received a new test file yesterday. Please provide samples from that file. Thanks!

comment: Hi Natalie, when I divided the number of page in the sample by the statement number of pages (4), I got 36. The text file says 40. Were there any statement being suppressed?

comment: [~enricob] 
Yes the sample is the 4.2o1 file so all the accounts aren't in there and some accounts had a missing address
