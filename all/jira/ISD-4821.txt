To log in as a user who do isn't enrolled yet, query the database for a sess_login_id that does not have an SSO date.

comment: Hi[~tai.trinh],

I have seen that the error observed by Natasha was because there was not email in the Usr_Fin_Account table.

In ssoOptoutAll.jsp page if email field is null in usr_fin_account table for all the accounts then it throws an exception.

Thanks.
