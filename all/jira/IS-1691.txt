title: SLCU API and Hypercube Migration - DLA and DNA: Remove Leading Zeros From Index
description: RUSH REQUEST: INTERNAL

Remove leading zeros from all account numbers for Daily Notice index files for two prefixes: dla and dna






author: phoebe.george
comment: [~rony] As discussed, here is the Jira Story; let me know if you need any other information for the rush request.

[~Igor.Khosid] I will be calling you shortly on this.

/z/isd_input_dev/I3/process-files/slcu/dla_20220728_1_20221007_1434_slcu.txt is the index file, you can check the index file to see there is no leading zeros.

SLCUDL001.zip toSLCUDL0018.zip (application slcudla) is in qa folder.

Parallel id:20221007142648

There is also another dfa in parallel id: SLCLUDN401.dfa (application slcudna). Project is also in qa folder. Needed to make same update to this one too. But I couldn't run the script to generate index file for it , since this is a red titan job (pdf data file) and we don't have access to redtitan server. I will ask [~phoebe.george]to have dp to run this in parallel. Then you can check the index file. For now please check the DLA ones.

comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid]

Below index file has 3 letters, 005,004,008.

dla_20220728_1_20221007_1548_slcu.txt

Index file for dna is:

dna_20221006_1_20221007_1509_slcu.txt

Leading Zeros removed From Index. However, please see below (#2 and #3)
1. DFA files  validated
Diff prod vs test
{color:red}SLCUDL001.dfa
SLCUDL002.dfa
SLCUDL003.dfa
SLCUDL004.dfa
SLCUDL005.dfa
SLCUDL006.dfa
SLCUDL007.dfa
SLCUDL008.dfa{color}
<     MOD_ACCT_NUM = RIGHT(ACCT_NUM,20,' ') ;
>     MOD_ACCT_NUM = RIGHT(ACCT_NUM*1,20,' ') ;
{color:red}SLCUDN401.dfa{color}
<
  MOD_AC_NUM = RIGHT(ACCT_NUM,10,'0') ;
>  
  MOD_AC_NUM = RIGHT(ACCT_NUM,10, '') ;

2. The index files were successfully processed, and the content was validated with the following randomly selected accounts 
(noticed - *{color:red}missing letters description{color}*)  >>>  !Missing letters decriptions.bmp! . {color:red}*_I do not see any ISD story assigned for daily letters._*{color}
dla_20220728_1_20221007_1434_slcu.txt (Letter 05 only)
dla_20220728_1_20221007_1548_slcu.txt (Letters 04/05/08)
dna_20221006_1_20221007_1509_slcu.txt (Letters 401 ...  406)
DL 05 >>> 320680 
DL 04 >>> 619273
DL 08 >>> 648598

3. Also [~rony] [~phoebe.george] >>noticed that DNA index file ... _1509 contains not only letter 401 but also *{color:red}402,  403, 404, 405, 408, 410, 411, 412, 413, 416, 418 and 419{color}*.
Wondering where these letters came from?
I'm unable to verify the exact number of the letters because ...
SOW >>>   !Letters_SOW.bmp!  
and the procs file  >>>    !Letters_procs.bmp! 
has the different numbers

[~phoebe.george] Can we have a brief conversation - Monday morning?

 


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~Igor.Khosid] It doesn't look like the SOW is up to date, as the IM team did not set up these notices recently, it's a much older setup.

Please message me as soon as you are able to review, as we are holding production cycles from Friday and hoping we can clarify today. Thanks!


author: igor.khosid
comment: QA - completed
Please see the previous comments - need to be fixed on Stage 
[~rony] - please attach IS checklist


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~rony] Does this require parallel, or can we move forward with release?



Thanks,

Phoebe


author: rony
comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid]

Checklist already attached. For slcudna only single dfa is handling for all letters.

!image-2022-10-11-18-50-02-682.png!



Hi [~phoebe.george] No parallel will not be needed. I am asking [~TunA]to release it.



Thanks

comment: [~rony] [~TunA] Based on the release, I had data center process for production and the leading zeros are still present. Can you confirm if all have been released?


author: tuna
comment: Hi [~rony], [~anwarh] We just have meeting for this project. [~phoebe.george]mentioned that this request is to remove leading zero for DLA and DNA. But the codes released this morning do not include format programs for DLA and DNA. When I check one DLA format program in parallel environment, I see the code for removing leading zero. But no one holding the DLA and DNA format programs with parallel ID. Can you please review this as soon as possible?

Thanks

comment: Hi [~phoebe.george], [~rony],

Per our Zoom conversation, I released following codes.

I found SLCU dla and dna format programs that Rony holding in his folder. Those are the one for removing leading zero. I think Rony attached wrong transfer form (IS-922 SLCU Transfer Form.doc) in IS-1691.



Phoebe will request DP to reprocess cycle #7 ONLY. If all is good, we will process the rest, if still bad, we will wait for rony to reply



Thanks

Tun

comment: [~rony] Can you confirm the update for 'DNA' application for Letter 410. I saw that it is part of the update, but showing that there are still some accounts posting with leading zeros for notice code 410 on some cycles. Please check recent production cycle #11 and cycle #12 that was processed today/yesterday.


author: rony
comment: Hi [~phoebe.george]

Would you please do me a favor then? Please ask Dp to run in parallel and let me know. This is redtitan job ( slcudna where data file is pdf ) and we don't actually have permission to run this type of job.



Thanks


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~rony] DP ran the file in staging, but i do still see leading zeros. I had them use cycle 10/12. Can you check? Thanks


author: rony
comment: Hi [~phoebe.george]

one more time
would you p lease ask Dp to reprocess in parallel
I had to update another resource that I missed initially.



Thanks


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~rony] DP reprocessed in staging and it looks good now, no leading zeros are present.

Please proceed with update. Thanks!
