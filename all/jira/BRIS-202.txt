title: Infotrac account search is not returning results some times
description: I was searching account 408 on ca-infotrac-pr-01 machine. It is calling infoservice-common and we have local host file entry pointing to 10.4.16.85. I am able to see pdfs after account search some times. Account search results are not consistent. Some times request fails to fetch information.
