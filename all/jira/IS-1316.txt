I loaded the AFP and it has the overlapping issue. It's theKYCUBK4.tiff somehow got placed in the first page instead of the second page. Could you check the formatting steps for estmt afp?

comment: [~fahad] what is the print range?  There are over 1500 accounts on these 2 dpvs.


author: JIRAUSER10910
comment: Hi [~kericapote],
I don't think you need to print from both of the dpvs. just print from the dpvs below.
for the dpvs[^kyculn1115.print]
print range from 4.2o1.afp : [ 1-2, 589-590, 201-202 ],

Thanks.


author: JIRAUSER10910
comment: [^kyculn1115_v2.print]
Hi [~kericapote],
Attached updated DPVS.
Print range from 4.2o1.afp : [ 1-2, 97-98, 115-116,125-126, 149-151,592-593 ],

FYI [~ratnam], [~kericapote],
It seems there's one type of statement which client wanted to put all of the content in one page, but it's not possible anymore to put in one page. There's no space. Have a look at the statement of Page149-151.

Thanks,
Fahad
