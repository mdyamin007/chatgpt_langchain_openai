comment: [~barnetts] Can you add the ISD estimate for this project? It's 1hr for testing.

comment: Hi [~Tin.Chak], It is is updated.

Thanks, Barnett

comment: [~eric.yan] Please assist with this. This is just testing/validation to ensure that the correct tax codes are inside the index file. To find out all the tax codes and descriptions, you can find them by searching in the doc_desc table where org_id is null.

Should new accounts be created for non-existing accounts for etax posting?



At the mean time, I'm checking on the "pending" status of the posted jobs.


author: eric.yan
comment: [~barnetts]

The pending status is just waiting for DP to release. Let me know if new account should be created.


author: barnetts
comment: HI [~eric.yan],

Please have account creation turned on.

Eric, I see tax forms on InfoTrac staging, please confirm that tax form 5498 is posted in December 2021 but it is 2020 year on tax form.

Form 1098r is good for 2021 year.

Thank you,
