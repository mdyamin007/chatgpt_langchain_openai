title: GCBK - [22660][pvt] Setup and Delink Notice - Savings Link
description: These are two new notices that go along with the other ticket for the fee notices. I wanted to keep them separate as this report will come from Gate City and the fee report is from Fiserv.

*021 - Savings Link Service Notification*
*Add dn/GCBK_SAVELINK_CONFM_CANCEL_MMDDYY.NN.csv.pgp to FTS list*

These will also be print and electronic. Archiving is to be determined, I dont know the logistics if it doesnt come from Fiserv.



Estimate about 10 hours for print 4 hours for estmt 4 hours for archival.=

We don't have resource to work on this until 10/11/21



Turnover to IS: 10/11/2021

Sample to client 10/21/2021

Client approval 10/23/2021

QA: 10/25/2021

Parallel test: 10/29/2021

Live 11/1/2021



-------

 IS 10hrs + ISD 4hrs + 4 hrs for archival = 18 hours

comment: [~dyuen], index file has been posted onto pilot and I do see the name 'Savings Link Service Notification' as expected.
