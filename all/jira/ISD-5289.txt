title: FLCU - Email Address Update bug fix in msm
description: None


author: mamunur.rashid
comment: Previously, after editing the email when the admin submitted the form then a Javascript error occurred saying "cannot access "value" of undefined". Because of this error, the form couldn't be submitted. That's why the email didn't get updated.

Hi Guys,

What is the Epic and TS numbers?

Please, update the due date

This issue was not passed from the client. It was noticed while doing hypercube migration analysis for FLCU. That's why there is no Epic and TS numbers and due date.

Thanks

I'm confused, so the issue already fixed and released to production?

It was an existing production bug. We found it while doing migration analysis. The fix is not been deployed on production. It is in the stage now.

Then the due date - actually when you want the fix to be released. You can't deploy in the past.
