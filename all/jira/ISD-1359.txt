comment: internal call for updates, disclosure passed pilot approval by client. Waiting mostly on IS updates.

comment: internal call #2, client provided test file.
 * Index file has acct type 'SA' rather than '54', will need to check if ewbb can fix it on their end and if not, we will need IS involved.
 * File came in for doc processing rather than for afp, enable doc processing for them in the process.

comment: Internal call on fri 10/30: Add new stmt type for hk statements and enable doc processing. Released on pilot, seems to work fine. Email template for hk is now enabled on pilot.

comment: Update from karen, ok to release the hk stmts onto prod even with admin site visibility. Posted 9/29 and 11/4 cycle manually without emails and correct acct type and stmt type are displaying in our db.

comment: ms4 still has default stmt type but we may not be posting these anymore. Pending whether this should be switched to hk moving forward.
