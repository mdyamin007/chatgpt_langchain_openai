comment: [~phoebe.george]: Can you ask PC team to create a DT_JOB_ID for the list of preingestion list:



[https://app.smartsheet.com/sheets/4jgqpqxM9238wqMfV47mmpp46fhmCrxjpCf954m1]

It will be needed for pre-ingestion processing. This program is written so that we have estmt job tracking turned on.



If it clutters job status in production, i can manually remove them after we get the pre-ingestion loaded in production.





[~thomasY]: Please prep this job for QA. Don't forget to add the logic to move the data file from ftpbu to download folder at the end of processing.

comment: [~thomasY]: Per my zoom chat, please go ahead and release code to production. If [~phoebe.george]has the DT_JOB_ID for all the pre-ingestion cycles, i will assist posting some this weekend because of how escalated this project is.



Please inform [~TunA]on the code release request.



[~phoebe.george]: Please mark your calendar to still go through parallel within this month. I want to ensure DP knows how to process these jobs since this is a new global custom script that they need to familiar and how the command works.
