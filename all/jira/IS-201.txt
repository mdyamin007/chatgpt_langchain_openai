comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com], [~lemoy28], and [~Igor.Khosid]: Spoke with Le, if QA passes today we can release today. However, if not, we can release tomorrow if there is no issues caught by QA.



We do not need to run through parallel since the logic is adjusting the transaction line contents.



[~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]: Per our discussion, I will be ok to make this an in-house type to support the last minute changes post going live so that we do not hold up the EOM cycle longer.



Thanks!
