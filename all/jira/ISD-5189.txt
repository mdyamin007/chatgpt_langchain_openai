description: # Why is there a difference in verbiage?
 # I know this is a bug on the page: The Both option only shows up when selective paperless is enabled. It does not otherwise. We should fix this.
 # Whats the timeout time? Its 15 minutes, right?
 # Is the timeout time configurable per client?
 # Is there a way to alter the verbiage? I think this same error page is shared between both errors and timeout, which may be the problem (poor design).
