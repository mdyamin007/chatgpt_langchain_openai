title: Temporary Windows Server:  Dell-2100 & Lanieradmin2 in Brisbane Office Subnet Request
description: Hi Kent,



Unfortunately there is still a few processes that we copy reports over to //dell-2100/ server and //lanier-admin2/docket. These two servers sit in the office network. Can we create a small temporary brisbane version of these two servers? All i need is to create share directories and roughly 200GB.

I will take care of creating the following share folders:



Accounting Report  [This is dell-2100 server and were we place Account PUI, PRP reports]

share [This is dell-2100\share folder]

docket [this is lanieradmin2\docket]



Please advise if this can be done and if so, can you please assign to your team to work on it.

We already have a temporary 'brisbane' windows file server and you can just clone it and place it in the brisbane office network if it is faster (Row 545) in brisbane server list.
