comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] there's no record under Insert Management on InfoTRAC stage, which is causing the posting error. Please have that created, piece code is 33463.

comment: [~rumanb] I see piece code 33526 in the index file, however the insert management form on infotrac stage has piece code 33463. Example line below:

DDA Statement|PDF|001|bkplms2_20220725_43104504_1.afp|bkplms2_25_1_20220831_1255_0.zip|20220627|20220725|21|43104504|D||Jones Electrical Supply LLC|||*33526,0,0,0,0*|||||

 Please coordinate with [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] so that the insert form has piece codes matching the value in the index file.

comment: [~rumanb] As mentioned in my previous comment, there is still a piece code mismatch where the index file has 33526 while the insert management form has 33463. Please advise.

comment: Hi [~Peter.Dang] [~terrencet]

Would it be possible to help here. We got dt job id from pc with insert 33526.



!image-2022-09-03-00-38-10-786.png!



And our index file has also this code. But insert management has code 33463. What to do here?

What you need to do is to find out which one is correct. If 33463 is correct, then you can ask P:C to change it. If 33526 is correct, then ask whoever to update insert management.
