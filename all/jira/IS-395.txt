comment: [~thomasY]please advise when you will have samples for customer approval. Live date 9/30.

Thanks!


author: thomasy
comment: Sample date is set for next week.


author: kericapote
comment: [~thomasY]I show samples are due today. Please confirm if we are on schedule.

Thanks!


author: thomasy
comment: [~kericapote] Some samples are copied to their client pickup. These are the only letters from today's production. I will need sample data for the other letters to generate ones for those.



Sample file names:

*UTCU_DP-MODSC_RETURN_ARCHIVAL_09202021.zip.pgp*
*UTCU_LN_LATE_ARCHIVAL_09202021.zip.pgp*
*UTCU_REGE_CONFM_ARCHIVAL_09202021.zip.pgp*

comment: [~thomasY] UTCU says they cannot decrypt. It says the secret key is not available. Please advise.


author: thomasy
comment: [~kericapote]Copied re-encrypted files over.


author: kericapote
comment: [~thomasY] customer added 4 new test files to TEST folder.



UTCU is asking:

would it be possible to also include the member number as part of the filename as well? Im just wondering what the possibilities might be as I think about getting these into the Document mgmt. system; or is there a way to create an index file on your end for everything that is coming back that would include account no., member no., member name, date sent, notice type, and filename?


author: thomasy
comment: [~kericapote]Those could be added but the live date of 09/30 will probably not be possible. Where would the member number come from? Please confirm specs (index content, name, pdf filename etc.) with them.


author: kericapote
comment: [~thomasY] UTCU says

I just placed a file into the test folder that could be a cross reference file for these daily notices that links the account number with the member number. I am okay if we leave the filename the way it is and can perhaps build an index file from the data from the cross reference file.



Let me know if it will work and if we can still make the 9/30 date.

Thanks!

author: thomasy
comment: [~kericapote]So, does that mean I'm not changing anything? What they're saying about the index isn't clear. Are they building it or am I doing it?


author: kericapote
comment: [~thomasY] UTCU says If Infoimage can build the index file with the archived pdfs that would be great. I can send over a cross-reference file as often as needed. We can have you keep the original file names that you initially sent over.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Keri


author: thomasy
comment: [~kericapote]Can you confirm the specs of the index file with them then? Note that if they want the cross referenced member number added into the index file, it will take some additional time


author: thomasy
comment: [~kericapote]Can you also confirm the pdf file names for letters 15 and 16 will use member numbers or is that not needed with an index file?


author: william.kong
comment: [~kericapote]: Please advise if you have any updates on the comments above. This is specification Thomas needs. Please advise if we have will have answer by EOD today. Live date is 9/30 and we need to have enough time to run parallel.


author: william.kong
comment: [~kericapote]: As mentioned in the ticket above. This specification is still pending. We cannot honor the live date for 9/30/2021.



We will put a hold on the release until we get this confirmed.


author: william.kong
comment: 

[~kericapote]: Per my comment above, we will not go live today, pending response from client.


author: kericapote
comment: [~thomasY] UTCU says the specs of the index file coming back from Infoimage for the various notices would include member number, account number, member name, notice type, filename, filedate.


author: kericapote
comment: [~thomasY] Please provide new sample date. Thanks!


author: thomasy
comment: [~kericapote]What about the name of the index files? I'm assuming it will follow the name of the data file.


author: thomasy
comment: [~kericapote]Do you have the names for the 4 test files they sent on 09/21 as well? I'm looking in the test folder but I don't see any received on that day.

I also copied 1 sample to their client pickup. Please have them verify that everything looks ok with names, index content etc. File is*UTCU_LN_LATE_ARCHIVAL_10072021.zip.pgp*

I am asking DP for the file names.

comment: [~thomasY] UTCU says:

I did notice the Ln_Late archival file in client_pickup this morning. I decrypted the file and took a look For some of the accounts it has the same number for the first two fields (member #, dna acct #). If the member number isnt known then it should probably pull in a null value for the member number. The file mostly looks good with distinct values in those two fields. Ill work on getting more files into the test folder.


author: thomasy
comment: [~kericapote]Did they want to leave the member number field blank if it is unknown or did they want to have "null" or 0 put there?


author: kericapote
comment: [~thomasY]

UTCU sent 4 test files and a cross reference file. Please review and let me know if you need anything else.

author: thomasy
comment: [~kericapote]Samples have been placed in client pickup.


author: kericapote
comment: [~thomasY] UTCU says:
|The index file looks great; however, the only problem I had is that the file was named the same in each archival [UTCU_DN_Index.txt] so when I unzipped into the same folder, it replaced the previously unzipped .txt file. If all of the indexes were put into one file that would be just fine, otherwise we'd need to have unique names for each index file.|

Let me know when you can provide new sample and when you want approval and I will give customer a time-line (after checking w Igor).


author: thomasy
comment: [~kericapote]Would they want all the archival files to be combined into 1 zip file rather than having a separate zip file for each? I would have to change each pdf name to include the letter code if so (eg "account_ltrcode_seq#.pdf)? Otherwise, I could rename each index file to match the zip file name. Let me know which they would like.


author: kericapote
comment: [~thomasY] per UTCU Yes. That would be awesome if they all could come in one file and one index file.


author: thomasy
comment: [~kericapote]I placed new samples into client pickup. Filename isUTCU_DN_ARCHIVAL.zip.pgp


author: kericapote
comment: [~thomasY] UTCU is asking:

The samples look great. It's nice to get them all in one file and one index. I'm wondering if we can have the developer add a relative marker in the index? ./ (period and forward slash) right before the filename and after the document date; this will tell the system to process from the correct directory.
 i.e. .....|09/20/2021|*./*750500002347_16_258.pdf


author: kericapote
comment: [~thomasY] Per Dave at UTCU - Also, I thought we had added the member # to the index file for the CC_LOWER and CC_CLOSE which doesn't seem to be in the UTCU_DN_index file. I only see Member # coming across in PS_NSFNT, SBBILLS, and LN_LATE.


author: thomasy
comment: [~kericapote]It is possible to add the period and forward slash. but in the example there are asterisks?



Regarding the member numbers, I checked several of the account numbers and they are not in the cross reference they provided.


author: kericapote
comment: [~thomasY] UTCU says:

I dont see any asterisks, so I dont know what youre referring to there. Im glad to hear they can put the ./ before the filename in the index. As far as the member# not being found, I believe member# is included in the index we sent over in the first column that has the data for the CC_Close, CC_Lower. Is the developer looking at that file, or the entire member_xref file that I had sent over?


author: thomasy
comment: [~kericapote] This is what I'm seeing for reference:

!image-2021-11-01-16-08-40-527.png!



I'm looking atUTCU_XREF.csv.pgp that was sent over on 10/14. Manually cross referencing some of the accounts in question, those accounts are not found inUTCU_XREF.csv.pgp


author: kericapote
comment: [~thomasY] UTCU says:

Ok. My original comment that I sent didn't have the asterisks so I was confused; perhaps the ticketing system must've added them in. Hmm.

On another note, I've reached out to the Bus. Intel guys on our side. They are going to develop a new index file that I can send over for you to use for all of the archival notices. It sounds like I should be able to send that over today and then hopefully this will get us back on track.


author: kericapote
comment: [~thomasY] UTCU sent the new index file:
|I placed a new index file that can be used for anything credit card related. It is in the test folder and is called UTCU_CC_XREF.txt.pgp|



Let me know if you need anything else to provide a sample.

Thanks!


author: william.kong
comment: [~kericapote]: I've asked [~thomasY]to review your comment above. Live date of 11/5 is no longer valid. [~thomasY]will be OOO tomorrow. We will need to provide a revised timeline early next week. 


author: thomasy
comment: [~kericapote]The format of the new index file is different.



*UTCU_CC_XREF.txt* :member number|dna account number|ccm account number|name|major type code|minor type code|ssn|status|employee

*UTCU_XREF.csv* *:*account number|member number|firstname, lastname|major type code|product type code|ssn_tin|status|employee|taxid|pers



I'll need to have some things clarified:
 * Will there be one combined xref or two xref files? If two, it would be preferable if they follow the same format.**
 * Currently we receive an xref with the nameUTCU_noticexref_mmddyy.csv.pgp. Will this be the one used for production or will the xref for archival be a file sent separately and used only for the archival?


author: kericapote
comment: [~thomasY]UTCU says:

I'm hoping that we can use one index file so I had it redone to include one more column if it is a credit card account. It's looking like I'll have that in the morning to send over and it will be named:*UTCU_XREF_MBR_CC.txt.pgp*
 
 
 Pipe-delimited fields will include: member number|account number|firstname, lastname|major type code|product type code|ssn_tin|status|employee|ccm account number
 
 
 ccm account number is the field that was added at the end.
 I'll let you know when I'm able to send this xref file over.


author: william.kong
comment: Per [~thomasY]it is WIP. Will need to revise timeline for this project.


author: kericapote
comment: [~thomasY] UTCU sent a new test file 11/5. I tagged you on the ticket. Have you reviewed? Please provide feedback.

Thanks!


author: thomasy
comment: [~kericapote]Yes, I'm still coding for the additional field.


author: kericapote
comment: [~thomasY] okay let me know when I will have a sample so I can put the dates into my time line and get QA's ok.


author: william.kong
comment: [~thomasY]: Per our conversation, you will work on generating new samples today.

comment: [~kericapote]Samples are placed in client pickup. Filename is*UTCU_DN_ARCHIVAL_11172021.zip.pgp*


author: kericapote
comment: [~thomasY] sample approved! Please move to QA.

Thanks!


author: william.kong
comment: [~kericapote]: Looks like the live date in your EPIC is 11/30/2021. I've updated the story. If it passes, we will schedule the release for 11/30 so that the new archival logic is applied on 12/1/2021.



[~thomasY]: Please work with [~Igor.Khosid]to get his team to QA this project. I believe Parallel will be required.



Thanks!

Please update*PDF Archival*: part page 4 in SOW with correct :

-individual pdf name

-index file name




author: kericapote
comment: [~thomasY] UTCU says:
We can call the xref file whatever and can certainly stick with the name UTCU_XREF_MBR_CC.txt.pgp.  If you need me to zip then I can change to UTCU_XREF_MBR_CC.zip.pgp.  I can send with the other daily files.  Perhaps we dont need to send daily and maybe once a week? 

Please advise which you prefer.
