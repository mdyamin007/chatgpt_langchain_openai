title: HCCU - StmtPDFi Conversion to AFP2PDF Python [InHse]
description: Update existing processing script to no longer use PDFi tool to create pdf.
 Instead use afp2pdf.py program with index_build_multicore option for ALL statement related apps.
 The smaller daily notice jobs can use the current index_build options.

All the zip file, pgp encryption, index file contents, and PDF file naming convention must remain exactly the same original specifications.

Please ensure the standard SOP on the directory structure must be followed: 
 ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/pdf, ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/zip, ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/work is followed.
 Also, clear the folder directory folder before each processing. We do NOT want to accumulate previous runs.

The current program should support checking total PDF counts verification to make sure the expected pdf matches the total number for pdfs generated; If not, incorporate this standard verification logic

DT_JOB_ID:
 133590-C00.01-V20987

Processing Scripts to modify:
 hccums1_process.sh

prefix: *hccums1*

Data Files to use:
 HCCU_RSTATPRT_053122.pgp



*NOTE*: This job runs on RH2. Since we are migrating from RHS to RH2, we should test all options so that we can do afpcompare and also ensure there is no errors in the processing logs.

 data file used: HCCU_RSTATPRT_ARCHIVAL_073122.pgp, (/d/download/hccu/monthly/202207/HCCU_RSTATPRT_ARCHIVAL_073122.pgp) 
 Parallel server's (rhs) output is kept at: /z/dsi_pdfi_testing/hccums1/new/pdf/

Production's output is kept at: /z/dsi_pdfi_testing/hccums1/old/pdf/

These pdf's name also contains the current server time.

Thanks,
 Rakib.

[~Igor.Khosid]: I've assisted copying the files mentioned above for easier accessibility for you guys.

ca-isis-pr-04:

/d/pdf_compare/hccums1_prod

/d/pdf_compare/hccums1_parallel folder.

 I ran the script:
{code:sh}
[andreyK@ca-isis-pr-04 pdf_compare]$ perl pdf_compare.pl hccums1_prod hccums1_parallel result_hccums1 -pixels 5 -threads 32 -regex '[0-9]+_[0-9]+_<SEQ>_[0-9]+.pdf'{code}

comment: QA is completed.
Test result:
{quote}Total PDF Files Scanned: 6000
allowedDifferenceInPercentPerPage: 5:
Thread Count: 32

Total PDF Files with Differences: 7
Please review the directory in /d/pdf_compare/result_hccums1 directory & /d/pdf_compare/result_hccums1/pdf_compare_rpt.txt report to see all the PDF differences
WARNING:  We did not compare ALL the pdfs!
          pdf_compare.pl will only process the first 6000 pdf files out of the total 20784 pdfs
Start Time: Wed Sep  7 15:25:18 PDT 2022
Finish Time: Wed Sep  7 16:34:35 PDT 2022{quote}

In my opinion, the differences in these 7 files are only because the parameter was set to a low value (-pixels *5*)

comment: Thanks [~Andrey.Kutsenko]! I agree with your assessment with pixels sensitivity.



[~anwarh]/rakibulH: Please prep File Transfer form and ask Tun to release. Please cc me in the Jira communication so that I can coordinate with DP to start using RHS server to process.
