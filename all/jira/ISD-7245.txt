comment: [~sahossain] -Did you set up the stage for testing? Should the verbiage be tested on Stage? 

[~gthillaivel] - please review


author: JIRAUSER11002
comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid].
Yes, Set up on stage for testing and I have attached the updated verbiage screenshot.
User login session timed-out verbiage will test on stage.

The session will time out after *10 minutes* of inactivity. During this time there should not be any activity on the site, i.e. you don't change the menu tabs or don't reload the page.

After 10 minutes the session will time out. Then if you click on any buttons or menu tabs or reload the page, you will see a page like this screenshot (Took this screenshot from the stage when timed out). That means your session has been timed out. After that, if you click anywhere then you may see the admin site's login page like your attached screenshot.

I have been able to access the pilot site.

You can try this URL: [https://sscupilot.infoimageinc.com:9880/], If you still don't have access, You can omit the port number and see if it works.

[~sahossain]--I tried to load the URL without port no,I am seeing the timeout message as soon as the page loads.It should appear only after the login session is opened and then,when user is idle in the page .See the video attached

[https://sscupilot.infoimageinc.com/]this link is the base url. If you hit on this link directly, you will see the session time-out page, which is not in the proper workflow.

For SSCU pilot, you can use[http://client-test.infoimageinc.com/sso/](client-test page). After selecting SSCU as the client to test, you can use the base url on the Form URL input field. Please see the attached screenshot for reference.

You generate the key by hitting_IFSIBhblogin.jsp_ page and submit the key hitting_IFSIBssoexchange.jsp_ page. After successful key submission, you will enter the SSCU pilot site. After successful sso, the session will timeout after 10 minutes of inactivity and you will see the session time-out page with updated verbiage.

Thanks!

I saw your attached screenshot, This was for the pilot.
Did you test on the stage? Because it was requested for stage testing.
