comment: [~nischala.manjunath]: Per our conversation just now, please help me run on RHT. I tried but getting different error. I would like to see if the issues you reported above have the same issues on RHT. Please re-assign this ticket back to me with your results. Thanks!

comment: [~William.Kong]: Done processing, there was no error with vcp to /z/isd_share/ and trigger_tracking_by_rec.pl but got the same pdf archival error - it can't locate the afp. 

Thanks!

comment: [~nischala.manjunath]: Just a minor update. I fixed the missing 'vcp' program from your first screenshot and updated my setup notes. This was also reported in Tien's ticket PDST-4 as well. However, i need your help to test on original rht box first to see if your 2nd & 3rd screenshot works. If not, please let me know.
