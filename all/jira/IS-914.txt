comment: William, the next cycle is coming on 3/13. We need to have this code rolled out by 3/11 so that Sunday's processing capture's the update. See client's email from yesterday:
_The more immediate topic to discuss is mortgage statement processing this Sunday 3/13/22, which we can try to do via email.  Our expectation is file processing should go as smooth as it did last cycle and proofs will be ready for us at 7:00 am PT, when we intend to start proofing.  Once approved, mortgage statements should upload to eStatements and eNotifications to go out same day, on Sunday 3/13/22.  Print and mailing will be the following Monday 3/14/22.  Please confirm this can be accomplished._

comment: Hi William, in reading an email from Carlo yesterday, they are OK with the later live date Peter provided of 3/17.

comment: [~andreav]: My understanding is that [~jira_naru]is able to make this released together this Friday by 3/14



[~jira_naru]: Let's proceed to include this release as intended so that we don't have a separate release date.
