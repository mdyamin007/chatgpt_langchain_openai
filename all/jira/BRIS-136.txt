title: pd-tools: Clone Request
description: Cloning the pd-tools server that has Redmine, Jenkins, and SVN.



[~kent.chan]: If I understand correctly, we are to clone the pd-tools server. Can we clone it first to make sure it works in the Brisbane server environment? Please note, i do not have a way to sync Redmine on a daily basis. So we may need to repeat the excercise during conversion weekend in Nov 14.

comment: Hesham recommends to reboot the computer to clear cache.

If this is shutoff, it need to be done after 6pm. 

Also, per Kent recommendation, Hesham will take snapshot of the VM in Menlo Park.
