I've attached the sample [^fnbkbn1204.2o1.zip].
However, I found an issue with the data file, a few accounts have one extra blank page in the data which is OK but account 1268729105 - dba North Texas Custom Plumbing has 164 pages of which 163 pages are blank. This account is routed to hvy  [^fnbkbn1205.hvy.pdf] 
Can they fix this issue?
Thanks!

comment: [~nischala.manjunath] FNBK says that he checked the original file and that account does not have blank pages before or after it. Could our program be adding them somehow?

Also, Please provide samples that have the return address and logo for customer approval. Maybe the e pdfs?

Thanks!

comment: [~nischala.manjunath] FNCK says:

The account number you are referencing is not a valid account number. It is the SBA Number for JM Carter Plumbing. Please have your developers check the source file. It looks like they have something seriously wrong.


author: nischala.manjunath
comment: [~kericapote], its not the program adding it. It is from the data file. I've attached the data file they sent us on  Aug 25th [^FirstIB_SBA_BillingNotices-ALL10464857308-20-2021.pdf]. Please look at page 310 onwards. That account has a lot of blank pages after. 
Also, we're using the SBA as the account number as discussed in the turnover meeting.
I'll have the archival samples on 09/27.

Thanks!


author: nischala.manjunath
comment: [~kericapote], I've placed the sample - fnbkbn1294.2o1.pdf in your AC Secure Shared FNBK directory.
Thanks!


author: nischala.manjunath
comment: [~kericapote], I've attached the DPVS -  [^fnbkbn129.print] to request print samples. The file to print is fnbkbn1294.2o1.afp. Account sequence - 301 to 331.
I've also placed the archival sample - FNBK_sba_loan_archival_092921_1.zip.pgp in your AC Secure Shared FNBK directory.
Thanks!


author: kericapote
comment: [~nischala.manjunath] FNBK ust thought of an issue with how estatements will work with the SBA bills. You see, the problem is that the SBA bills have the loan numbers from our SBA system that is on their bills, but they are assigned a different number when we import them into our DNA core so that customers can see them in online banking FNBK . See email for details.



I'm pretty sure we need a x-ref file. I will request one.


author: nischala.manjunath
comment: [~kericapote], I saw the email. Yes, we will need a cross reference file to map the SBA numbers to other ones.
Thanks!


author: kericapote
comment: [~nischala.manjunath] I've sparked you a couple times but you must be busy so I thought I'd put it here as well. Can you please post the archive to client pick up? It is too big for me to email. Also I can't open it so I'm not sure if it is corrupted or if my computer just can't open it. 

Also, is it ok for us to push paper and archive then go back and do e? I don't want to hold everything up as I haven't received the x-ref file yet.


author: nischala.manjunath
comment: [~kericapote], I didn't receive a spark from you, I tried messaging you on there as well but not sure if you saw it. Archival sample file - FNBK_sba_loan_archival_092921_1.zip.pgp is placed in the client pickup directory, you probably couldn't open it because it is encrypted similar to archival files from other fnbk apps.
Yes, we could first go live with paper and archival and then later code for x-ref file and eStatements. It will be a 5 hour estimate to code for the x-ref file.
Thanks!


author: kericapote
comment: [~nischala.manjunath] FYI from FNBK: (we will need a new time line once he provides the x-ref file. I will let you know what I propose.)
 * I picked up the archival file this morning. This is outside of our automated process, so I may have to wait until next week for our sysadmin to return from vacation to decrypt it.
 * We are still working on the cross ref file. This particular one requires a decryption tool which we just acquired yesterday. Im hoping to have one to you next week. I should be able to send the SOW to you next week as well.
 * Yes, we would want to suppress print once the customers select the E-statement.


author: kericapote
comment: [~nischala.manjunath] FNBK is hoping to get the new x-ref file next week. Moving live date to eom.


author: kericapote
comment: [~nischala.manjunath] FNBK placed the x-ref file in the test folder on our ftp.

comment: [~nischala.manjunath]/[~kericapote] /[~Peter.Dang]: This project is+way past due+11/30/2021. Please advise status and if we have an agreement from [~kericapote] that this project has a new live date. Today is code freeze date. We cannot guarantee what will be a new revised date and it may hit next next year in February/March.



Please work with [~Peter.Dang]to mutually agree on what a new timeline should be for this project; If there is no expectation, i would advise to change the status to "HOLD".


author: kericapote
comment: [~William.Kong]All we need is for [~nischala.manjunath] to create htt index file so ISD can post e to pilot for approval. I do not want to push to next year when we are 90% done with this project.


author: william.kong
comment: [~kericapote]: This will depend on [~nischala.manjunath]'sworkload in December and for [~Peter.Dang]to confirm. She may have existing commitments for other December projects that are on schedule and we cannot have projects this past due impacting other projects.

[~Peter.Dang]: Please discuss with [~nischala.manjunath]in your scrum meeting today.


author: william.kong
comment: [~kericapote]: Can you please work with Igor and Peter on the timeline.

comment: [~tai.trinh] - Can you please post bn1_20211001_1_20220105_1257_fnbk.txt to pilot? I can't find an ISD story to update for this setup.
[~kericapote] - The dpvs is attached - [^fnbkbn129.print]  . The file to print is fnbkbn1294.2o1.afp, account sequence: 301 - 320.
There are two accounts in the data file (loan numbers 5298067 and 500898) with no match in the cross reference file, please advise on how to handle these.
Also, can you please confirm the file naming convention of the lookup file? Are they going to send it along with the input pgp file for every cycle? 
Thanks!


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~nischala.manjunath] I've posted the file onto pilot successfully. There are only two accts that did not post, which I believe are the ones you mentioned earlier. There is a story ISD-1415 that was created a long ago, thus it's not linked to this story. I added myself as a watcher for this story IS-345 though so I'll still receive updates.

 # Nischala - Did you code for an anchor? what anchor did you use?
 # Keri - I don't see any endorsement on the print samples, per SOW it should appear*On the Printed Document.*


author: nischala.manjunath
comment: [~berezinez] - This is a redtitan setup, it uses csv and tiff files as input for the format dfa. There is no anchor.
I might have forgotten to add the endorsement flag to the control file, I'll reprocess and let you know.
