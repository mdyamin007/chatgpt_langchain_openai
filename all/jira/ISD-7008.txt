comment: [~phoebe.george] All statements for those 3 accounts should be moved over to their respective DD acct types. There should be no more statements under the MM type.

comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] There are two users tied to Account #534407037. One of the users (sbowers) logged in yesterday through Bottomline OLB and cannot see the eStatements. The login time was approximately 11 - 11:30am PST on 5/10. Not sure if you can tell in the SSO logs why the user is not able to see it. They are an 'authorized user', but can you tell by the login 'sbowers'? Thanks!
