title: ca-rtitan-pr-01:  Blue Screen INFOIMAGE\neil Account
description: [~hesham.hanna]: I tried logging using INFOIMAGE\neil account. But after I authenticate, i just get a "blue" screen: The IP address is10.4.20.122. However, if I log in as 'administrator' there is no issue. Ping me tomorrow and I will share neil's password.
