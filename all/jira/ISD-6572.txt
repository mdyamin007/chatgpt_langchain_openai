title: Enabling restrict time manager for email notification in PUI
description: None


author: mamunur.rashid
comment: The following flags are introduced (*in client's conf file*) for restricting sending email notifications from PUI between a specific time period.
 # *notification.enableTimeManager:*Whether we want to enable time management or not.
 # *notification.restrictStartTime:*If we want to manage time then what would be the start time.
 # *notification.restrictEndTime:*If we want to manage time then what would be the end time.

Test cases:
 * If*notification.enableTimeManager*is false then PUI will send notification immediately after the email job is triggered.
 * If*notification.enableTimeManager* is true but*notification.restrictStartTime*and*notification.**restrictEndTime*is null then nofication sending will be restricted from 22 (10 PM) to 6 AM. That means default restrict start and end time is 22 and 6 respectively.
 * If*notification.enableTimeManager* is true and*notification.restrictStartTime*and*notification.**restrictEndTime*value is set then notfication sending will be restricted between the given time.

Hi Mamunur, I understand logic you described, but i don't know how to test it. It is very new for QA.

Can you please provide details where to change timeManager parameters and how to test it.

Thank you,

Natasha

A Dev can help you to set those parameters in the client's conf file.
 # Stop the pilot PUI server.
 # Edit a client's conf and add those parameter. (i.e: edit /usr/local/processing_ui/conf/acbk.conf)
 # Start the pilot PUI server.
 # Process document (or other processes which register email notification) for that client.
 # Go to the email notification tab and trigger email notification for that process.
 # Check if the email notification is restricted between the given time.

[~Tin.Chak]could you please help Natasha to do the testing?

Thanks
