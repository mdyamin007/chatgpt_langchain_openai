comment: [~SamV2021] - Hi Sam, what is the status of the samples? They are due today. Please also let me know when you can have a dpvs ready so we can print physical samples to send to the client.

Attached local samples[^mfcuea1_local_sample.pdf]produced from test file:[^MFCU Analysis Statements Cover Letter 3.31.22.pdf]

DPVS for physical print samples will be ready on Friday.

Please also inform the client of the following: In the provided test file, loan number information was not present from page 119 onward. Please have them confirm that loan number information is guaranteed to be present on the second page of each account, as per the mapping.


author: andreav
comment: Thanks Sam.
[~enricob] - Please check the samples and confirm they look good. If so, please provide sample to the client for sign off via the TS ticket 26922 and let them know about the missing loan numbers.

author: phoebe.george
comment: [~SamV2021] MFCU approved the samples. Please proceed with next steps to prepare for QA.

[~enricob] [~dyuen] FYI, I noted this from MFCU approval from TS#26922

[~andreav] The ticket confirmed print samples are not required. Also, I could not update the timeline as it is locked for updates only by the creator of the timeline.


author: andreav
comment: Sam, I see Phoebe said client approved on 4/8 and instructed to move to QA. What other approval are you waiting for? I don't see any EA job posted on InfoTRAC pilot.


author: JIRAUSER10906
comment: As per our conversation, working on remaining features, e.g. account count check at the end of processing. Will be able to move to QA by this Friday 04/15/22.

There is an issue with the data (2nd page see attached print samples) - showing only $0, Loan # and Address - blank.


author: andreav
comment: Sam, see print samples that Igor attached. All accounts have zero values and page 12 output looks weird:
 !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! 


author: andreav
comment: [~enricob] - Sam confirmed the zero values is how the test data is coming. Can you confirm the client expects the output to appear this way when no values?


author: JIRAUSER10906
comment: [~Igor.Khosid] [~andreav] [~enricob]

As per my conversation with Andrea, page 119 onwards of the test file feature pages just like what we see on page 12 of the print sample.

In addition to pages with essentially no values, there are pages in the test file that contain some information (loan #, address information) but feature $0.00 values.

Coincidentally, the print range I chose for print samples feature these pages from the test file that either have missing information or have $0.00 values.


author: enricob
comment: This is in the data file and client is aware of it.


author: andreav
comment: Thanks for confirming Enrico.
Igor, upon turn over, please continue to QA. Sam should have all turned over to you by this Friday.

The logo needs to be moved to the right to align with the 2Dbar - 1/2" see below

comment: [~SamV2021] [~andreav]
As per our conversation slightly visible portion when the statement moved to the left and down
see below

comment: [~Igor.Khosid]

Per my conversation with Andrea, there's no change needed for the slightly visible portion of the statement as it is not showing any confidential information.

For moving the logo to align with the 2D bar, I have made the appropriate change. We can request new print samples if needed, or we can just have ops verify the change during parallel testing.

Thanks!


author: igor.khosid
comment: [~SamV2021] - agreed we can verify that during the parallel testing


author: igor.khosid
comment: [~andreav] [~SamV2021] 
The logo and return address on the heavies cover page shows up now.
Print samples - attached >>>  [^IS-945_MFCU_Print samples 04152022_HVS.pdf] 
However, we might want to move the logo portion and the address block - about 1/2" down (tested with 4406)


author: JIRAUSER10906
comment: [~andreav]

Hi Andrea, could you request print samples for the following:

This is to test whether the same issue with the logo/address block positions exists on another application since these positions are standardized for heavies and are coded as such in our standard print dfa programs.
