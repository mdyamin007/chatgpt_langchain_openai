comment: Hi Najoa, since I cannot check these myself, I will forward to client to check. 


author: andreav
comment: [~Najoa]Najoa, I am sorry I did not copy them here but did you use the test data that the client sent for samples in the Team Support ticket comment #28? Here they are in case you did not. In the meantime, I forwarded them the samples you provided today.

comment: Awesome, thanks!

comment: [~Najoa] - See client's feedback and provide new samples by tomorrow, 5/26.

_A minor issue with the letters. The document numbers, the characters on the bottom right hand corner of the page, usually contain the month and year that we will go live with the letter. If it's not a big ask, can you get update the date portion of the document number from "04/22" to "06/22"? Otherwise, we can leave them as is if it will delay the go live date._
