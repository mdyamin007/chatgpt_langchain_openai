Can you please look into this issue

comment: PC team controls estmt tracking enabling. If they disable e-job will not be visible on job status. If you verify pui logs in your screenshot, flag=n is printed. It will be printed as y if they have enabled that. Reach to PC team about this. Not all jobs may have tracking enabled.
