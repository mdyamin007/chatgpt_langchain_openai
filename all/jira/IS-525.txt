Initially, the story was turned over to QA for the sample review.
After the customer approved the sample, the state was updated to "Pilot / Sample approved," meaning that the developer can complete anything left unfinished. 
After that, he needs to turn it over to QA for final testing.

In addition, please confirm the following:

1. process.sh is updated, wondering if the procs file - should be updated as well with the new letters numbers

2. Index file is not provided

3. ISD story - not created and the letters name also should be updated on InfoTrac


author: kdishroon
comment: [~Igor.Khosid]They do not have eNotices set-up yet so there would not be an ISD story.
