Hi Diego, new attachments received.

[~Ricky Lopez]

At this point, are we waiting for Wilson to create a .TIF containing all the green boxes and the logo to ensure that the color matches?

Thanks,
Sam

Hi Ricky, thanks for following up. I have everything I need to begin working on this project. I think we are still waiting for confirmation from TXOPS regarding color matching, but I have started working on the project and the expected sample date is: 10/05/22.

Please update the smartsheet timeline when possible.

Thanks,
Sam

I have attached the 1st set of samples:[^colu_loan_coupon_samples_rev1.pdf]generated locally fromALSNCOUP_20220609.DAT, so only the first 100 pages have been generated. Please review.

Also, one question: Will the # of loan coupons specified in the data file (columns 276-278) always be in multiples of 3, up to 12?

[~Ricky Lopez]FYI

Thanks,
Sam

comment: [~SamV2021] i believe the max is 12, can we set it up so regardless of what number it is it will print that many instead of always trying to print in multiples of 3?


author: diegof
comment: [~SamV2021] this has been confirmed. They are not in always in multiples of 3.

comment: [~SamV2021]-Client approved PDF sample, we will send them physical sample as well, once we have DPVS.

comment: [~Ricky Lopez]

Hi Ricky, can you request both a pilot and staging DT_JOB_ID from PC? I can provide a DPVS as soon as I get them.

Also, I have a couple potential discrepancies regarding the SOW:
 # On SOW, 6x9 half fold is marked, but envelope 1 is '4401', which I believe is house #10 instead of 6x9.
 # On SOW, the recipe code for stock code 7007 is '03', but stock code 7007 (which is used by other applications as well) is currently configured to use recipe code '02'.

Thanks,
 Sam

Attached DPVS so that print samples can be sent to the client for review. Note: that I don't believe PC has configured the piece codes, so the inserts (material #6194 - 12-up insert labels) will not be pulled.

Print sample info:
 * Parallel Environment
 * DPVS:[^colulc1101_dpvs.pdf]
 * Filename: colulc11014.2o1.afp
 * Image Range:1-42
 * Tray 1 Stock Code: 7007

Please also update the due dates on this story and epic IMPL-2144 to match what is on the smartsheet.

Thanks,
 Sam

Hi Ricky, any updates on this?

Thanks,
Sam


author: JIRAUSER11400
comment: [~SamV2021]this one had to be mailed via USPS, so it maybe another day or two.

Hi Ricky, I see on Smartsheet that you added feedback saying that "the dotted line needs to be added to coupon." Is this referring to how the line perforations are missing? Or do they want dotted lines over these perforation lines?

Also, can you please confirm the recipe code to be used for stock code 7007 in tray 1? On the SOW, it says recipe code 03, while stock code 7007 is currently programmed to use recipe code 02.

Thanks,
Sam


author: JIRAUSER11400
comment: [~SamV2021]- The CU is wanting the perforations on the horizontal fold lines.



This one will be printed in TX with 2 perf lines (recipe 03) with 7007.


author: JIRAUSER10906
comment: [~Ricky Lopez]

Hi Ricky, since stock code 7007 is currently programmed to use recipe code 02 and each stock code can only be assigned one recipe code, we need a new stock code specifically to be used with recipe code 03 (2 perf lines).

There is no existing stock code corresponding to the 20# Plain White Paper Roll using 2 perf lines, so please request a new stock code.

Thanks,
Sam


author: JIRAUSER11400
comment: [~SamV2021] COLU-LC should it be stock code 4006 for Recipe 03


author: JIRAUSER10906
comment: [~Ricky Lopez]

Per our conversation, yes stock code 4006 should be correct. Please request new print samples and have ops verify that the 2 perforation lines show up. Please also send QA a copy of these print samples. Once that is verified, do we need additional client approval? Otherwise, we can proceed with QA review.
