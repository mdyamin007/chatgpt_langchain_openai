comment: I'm not sure, usually, we just update the PROD. This is for parallel. Please check with [~Igor.Khosid].

I just checked with Terrence, and he confirmed that the information should be entered for all instances Prod, PARR and test

comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid], [~terrencet], 

We get this App Num & Version from the SOW, but the SOW only has the prod one. 
Where can I get them for parallel and test? 

Thanks

comment: Anwar,

For new setup. In order to properly post document onto pilot or staging (parallel), you will need to request valid dt_job_id from PC. At that time, you have the opportunity to created the record.
