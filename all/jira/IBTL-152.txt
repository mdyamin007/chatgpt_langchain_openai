title: WFCU - Prod:  Reviewing AFPCompare Results
description: [~jira_naru]: Can you spend time today or Monday to review the afpcompare results DP did between Brisbane and Menlo:



I believe the results are in the Menlo Park Data Center in the following directory. Rogelio helped run this testing. 



Please advise if there are any differences or issues with the output:

comment: Will,

Base on the result in the XML file,wfcums1131_menlo_pr.afp_diff.xml, looks good, there are no differences.

I am not sure what the other XML files are for, (wfcums1131_menlo_pr.afp_nop.xml andwfcums1131_menlo_pr.afp_sum.xml), you will need Ernest input on those.

comment: [~jira_naru]: thanks for confirming that there is no issues! This is a good relief that there is no data integrity issues!



[~ernestw]:  Can you review the other files to see if those are relevant:

Per Nar:

" I am not sure what the other XML files are for, (wfcums1131_menlo_pr.afp_nop.xml andwfcums1131_menlo_pr.afp_sum.xml), you will need Ernest input on those."

comment: you can ignore the other xml files, just concentrate on the diff.xml file. The other one is for the afp record structure that we do not use.

comment: [~ernestw] and [~jira_naru]: I will close this ticket out and also notate in SmartSheet Brisbane that afpcompare had no differences. Thanks!
