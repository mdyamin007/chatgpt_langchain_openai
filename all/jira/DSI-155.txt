I think it is okay to have createAccount enabled on Development. However, that should not be enabled on the higher environment (Pilot, Stage, etc.)

comment: I have tested GCBK etax processing. My update:

Backend:
 * data is getting inserted in the following tables:etax, p_job_etax, p_job_email, ARCH_FILE.
 * no update for any account in: fin_account, paperless2, paperless

Front-end:
 * etax is showing in Root site. (24 months archival for testing)
 * etax is showing in MSM site. (24 months archival for testing)
 * if etax status is 0 (not approved), not showing in front-end

PS:
 * tested in dev environment.
 * Ignored two columns while testing: SSN/TAX_ID | INPUT_ZIP_FILENAME
 * email notification is not tested

Please find the attached test case.

Archival period was not given. So now it is set to 24.

Processing UI code has been deployed to pilot.

I do see the GCBK front end code committed to trunk or any branch in estmt2. Can you double check and see if they are actually committed? If they are, please let me know the revision number. Also, please deploy GCBK front-end to Pilot.

code has been committed in */estmt2/gcbk/brances/dsi-responsive*, the revision number is *21029*.
currently we do not have permission to build prism client using jenkins, so we won't be able to deploy gcbk front end to pilot.
