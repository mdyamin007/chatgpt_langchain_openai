For slcu platinum and visa

!image-2022-10-06-16-24-07-142.png!



This was the previous envelope set up

ENV1="5633"
ENV2="5633"
ENV3="5633"
ENV4="4406"



which we also updated to below in https://jira.infoimageinc.com/browse/IS-1364.

ENV1="5123"
ENV2="5123"
ENV3="5123"
ENV4="4406"



Should we also bring back the old settings of envelopes for these 2 apps or change it to:

Envelope 1: 4401
Envelope 2: 4401
Envelope 3: 4402
Envelope 4: 4406

.



Let me know, yesterday we missed uploading this 2 apps to production.



Thanks

Please ignore the previous message. I am providing those 2 updates to qa. I changed the envelope to 4401. My apology about missing these 2.

Hi [~Igor.Khosid] missed slcumv2.control and slcumv3.control to make the envelope update yesterday.
