comment: [~Kbittmann] The doc attached to comment 1 in 26608 has some annotations within a yellow box that seem a bit cutoff. I've tried viewing the entire box but so far I haven't been able to. Can you see if you're able to view their requested changes? If so can you provide the whole verbiage for section 7 so that I can make the proper updates?

comment: [~Kbittmann] if you're referring to the image file, that's their current disclosure verbiage. On 26608, if you open up the pdf in comment 1 and however over the yellow section, you should see a squarish yellow annotation box with some text which seems to be cutoff at the bottom. Attaching image for reference.

Samples approved. Please provide a new live date.

comment: [~Kbittmann] thanks, I think we can set a new tentative live date of 3/16 to give some buffer time for QA if that's ok. I'll work on moving this over to stage and pass it over to QA today as well. Most likely we can release this sooner, maybe even today, depending on how things go.

comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid],

I've released a verbiage update to the disclosure on step 2 of the SSO enrollment steps on stage. Can you please test logging into SSO stage and verifying that bullet point #7 matches the content within snfb_disclosure_pilot.PNG that is attached to this story?

For SSO stage, most of the prefilled information can be used besides the Cif Number. Here's a few test Cif Numbers to use:
100000001
100000002
100000003

Thanks,
Shun
