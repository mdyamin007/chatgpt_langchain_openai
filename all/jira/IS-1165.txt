comment: [~Kbittmann] - please update the due date

The story was created back in May, and it is not fair for QA to have "QA date" and the "Due date" the same.

I asked for a new date a few days ago. One was not provided. Please provide a new live date and I will update.

Could you adjust the live date to 07/21.

comment: [~andyp], please clarify.
Which Parallel ID to use for QA review?

The description for this story talks about updating *snfb_dda_process.sh* (+Parallel ID: 20220713155028+). 
In the comments, you write about +Parallel ID: 20220713161939+ where another file changes (*snfbms1_process.sh*)


author: andyp
comment: [~Andrey.Kutsenko]

The correct change was in snfbms1_process.sh

The description was wrong. Program snfb_dda_process.sh was obsolete.

Also the description of the fix in TS 29533 was also wrong.

*{color:red}Please confirm{color}* if Andy's updates are what you requested or please update the descriptions.
My understanding is that the original assessment made by Peter see TS# 29533 is inaccurate

[~andyp] [~Andrey.Kutsenko] - FYI

comment: [~Igor.Khosid] [~Andrey.Kutsenko]

I already confirmed that the change was correctly in processing script snfbms1_process.sh.

FYI,

Here is the cron set up in rhs2.
