comment: Hi [~Bryanl],

I misunderstood the requirement of this task.

I thought the task was to move the disclosure from top to bottom of the 2nd page.

But it looks like the requirement is to move the disclosure from 2nd page to the last page of the statement (after inline insert).

If client wants to move the disclosure from 2nd page to the end of statement, then we have to print the disclosure after the inline inserts.

For *Paper option* after inline inserts a brand new physical page starts. In that page should the disclosure go to the *front page* or *back page* for *paper option*?

Or let us know If we have to place the disclosure *before* the inline insert.

For archival it is not a problem.

Thanks

I have asked client for clarification, thanks!

Please see client's response below:



The print team's understanding is incorrect. The preference would be that the disclosure goes to the end of the statement after the inline insert. It is also noteworthy that we will not have an inline insert each month.

In terms of front or back for paper, the option that would result in the least amount of paper printed. Does that make sense or is it not possible to have this be variable pending how many pages the statement itself is?



Thank you!

comment: Hi [~Bryanl],

If inline insert will not be used in each month then we have to modify our program for that. Like right now we don't know for which month client wants inline insert and for which month it's not required.

Currently we are printing inline insert without any condition in the program.

If we know the condition when not to display inline insert then it will be more effective to place the disclosure at the end of the statement.

Please inform about this to client.

Thanks

I am responding to this in [~Bryanl]'s absence:

The client said "We would only use an inline insert on a quarterly basis (March, June, September, December). I am open to the print team's recommendation on accomplishing moving the disclosures to the end of the statement at minimal monthly manual effort/cost."

Thank you,

Keri

comment: Hi [~kdishroon] [~Bryanl],

We are going to check the month of "statement end date" to determine quarterly basis statement.

Please review attached sample and provide it to client.[^ufcums11074.2o1.pdf]

Thanks

Client approved sample, let me know if this will need qa/parallel. Thank you!


author: mahbubs
comment: Hi [~Bryanl],

Client asked 2 questions in TS. Below is my opinion about those:

1. Yes, the sample just to illustrate how the disclosure would look with an insert

2. Yes, the message image is just a placeholder



This task needs QA and parallel.

Thanks

comment: [~Bryanl]: Although samples are approved, the live date of 4/15 is way past due. We need to revisit the timeline when [~mahbubS]returns next Thursday. In the meantime, please raise the answers above to client.

I am provided answers to client, please let me know when there is a new live date for client. Also please make sure that the inline insert will not appear on April and May monthly statements as client keeps bringing up this concern, thanks!


author: mahbubs
comment: Hi [~Bryanl],

If this go live hopefully only quarterly statement would have inline inserts.

Just April data need to rerun after releasing code to get rid of inline inserts.

Thanks

Thanks Sakib, just making sure as this code release might not happen by this end of month in time for April statements and we do not want their quarterly inline inserts on them.
