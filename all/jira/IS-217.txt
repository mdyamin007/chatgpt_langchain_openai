comment: The return address that we are looking to change is embedded in the pseg. There's no pseg/overlay attached to any of the Jira tickets or TeamSupport ticket #20297, so either we modify the pseg using existing tools, obtain a pseg with the updated address, or use the existing preprint pdfs (one of them contains the InfoIMAGE return mail address) and set up an e-form.

comment: Waiting for updates from Peter regarding updates to the return address on the statement because it would need to be changed for electronic versions, along with if and when an e-form is set up for this job.

This ticket (and associated Jira tickets) put on hold for now.

This change to the envelope stock code in each job's corresponding control file is complete.

Please let me know if there is anything you would like me to provide.
