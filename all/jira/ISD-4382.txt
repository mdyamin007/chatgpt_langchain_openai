description: This issue seems to be occurring for any user who has a secondary user that is older than the primary user in our usr_mapping table (i.e. the secondary user usr_mapping_id < primary user usr_mapping_id).

comment: Switched the usr_mapping_ids for the secondary and primary so that the primary now holds the older usr_mapping_id.

comment: Client confirmed we can remove secondary user (usr_id 43485313). Removing this user from all tables except usr.

Secondary user now removed. Pending client response
