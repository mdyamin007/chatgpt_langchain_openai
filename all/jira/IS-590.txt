The xml is being created with a type of "VISA ANNUAL STATEMENT", when it should be "VISA ANNUAL STATEMENTS". The S is missing at the end. This is small but would cause the entire batch to fail and we would have to manually correct each line to get it to file to Synergy.

Please correct and send us a new test file. Thanks Johnny

comment: [~billr] : This project is past due (12/16).Please bear in mind, between now and until end of January, we will not be able to promptly respond to this project. Live date will need to be revisit for February 2022.



[~thomasY]: For now, I will mark live date to be Feb 7, 2022

comment: [~thomasY], client just confirmed the XML works now/as expected.

Per [~William.Kong]'s comment, the live date has been pushed out. However, is there a way this can be rolled out? Otherwise, it would have to sit for a month before anything gets moved along.

Thanks


author: dyuen
comment: [~William.Kong], disregard.



[~thomasY], looks like RWCU has another adjustment that needs to be made. Please see following:

Well it looks like we need to make another change to the XML.

The DocName and Type need to match. See below:
