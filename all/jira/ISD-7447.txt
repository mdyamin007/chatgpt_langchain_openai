I can't find where the "Statements from 2022" title is located, could you or the client provide a screenshot which title to update?

comment: Hi Steve,

The three letter names are updated in pilot and ready for review.



But the banner is actually not customizable and it's the same for all applications. E-Notice has its own tab but it shows "Statements from 2022" as well.

If it's easier you could just run it in parallel and I will manually post it.
