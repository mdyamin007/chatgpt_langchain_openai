title: OSCU - External Enrollment File Setup
description: Permanent update to setup 'External Enrollment File' per standard specifications (provided to CU separately) to send as a daily file back to OSCU.
File will be automatically dropped in the FTP 'client_pickup' folder at a set time every morning - 5am PST.

The file sent to CU should only contain entries for enrollment changes made during the specified period (incremental).

comment: [~mac] The sample file was approved. I'm pending a confirmation on when the CU would like us to start sending the file automatically though, as they are setting up automation on their end too. Please let me know the target date for your possible code release and I will see if that date works on the CU side. Thanks!

comment: [~phoebe.george]I can release the code tomorrow 10/27/2021.

comment: [~mac] OSCU let me know today that they will confirm on Thursday what timeframe they would like us to push the file to them for the external enrollment file. If you do code release, can you wait on enabling the automation time for the file? Or would it be best to release code after they confirm the final timeframe on Thursday? Thanks!

I can release the code first and then wait for the enabling of the automation.

comment: [~phoebe.george]Does the client want the report emailed to them? If so, can you provide me the email, thanks!

comment: [~mac] - a few updates from OSCU:


 # No email notification required when the file is copied for pickup.
 # Please setup the file to be sent to client pickup daily (Mon - Sun) at 9am PST.

QUESTION: Will we send a file even if its empty?
