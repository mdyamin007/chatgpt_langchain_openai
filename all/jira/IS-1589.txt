title: EWBB - [33042][pvt][in-house] 1099-INT Account Number Update (ML6)
description: Hot fix for 1099-INT (ML6):

Update EWBBML61.dfa to no longer expect a maximum of 10 characters (i.e. do not truncate any part of the account number). While the longest account number in any previous cycle has been 10, that should not be taken as fact. Rather, the program should accommodate a longer account number.

Hi Gnana,

I can confirm that there is no control file change for my mortgage applications as "track_by_rec" is already turned on.

Thanks,
