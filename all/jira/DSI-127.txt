title: Return Specific Verbiage if unable to hit the site
description: If a new member tries to log into eStatements before the latest CIF File is sent, there will be an error, because the user cannot be tied to an account or found in the database.

They want to know if it's possible to display a "Come back later" message to the member rather than showing an error page.

They want to know if this is a possible outcome.

comment: Hi [~Ethan.Yu] We can have custom message. Can you explain the requirement or issue in more details? What would be the actual condition and user will see the message? We know, we have only encoded string from NECU and after processing it we can find accounts and other parameters.

comment: Hi Dipak, I'll wait for the client to respond with what they're seeing, and I'll get back to you on what they'd like. Thanks for the response!
