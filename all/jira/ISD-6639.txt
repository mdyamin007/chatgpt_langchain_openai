This is what I have in mind for the SURU Bounceback report.  Please let me know if I need to change any.

- a single report file monthly
- include all statements (Statements,Invoices,Daily Notices)
- include these values in the report:  CIF NUMBER|ACCOUNT NUMBER|APP CODE|ACCOUNT HOLDER NAME|EMAIL ADDRESS|CODE|REASON|DATE
- client is notified when it is ready (I will need the email address)
- client pick it up from client_pickup folder

Regards.

I just ran the Bounceback Report in Pilot.

The client may have just received an email notification with the subject "SURU: Your e-mail Bounceback Report is Available for Download" and the report would be waiting for them in the client_pickup folder (it won't be there now because this is not live yet.)

I have attached the report for client review.

Another report has been generated.  The client should just received an email "SURU: Your e-mail Bounceback Report is Available for Download".

If this were live, the client can download it from client_pickup folder.  I have attached it here for client review.

Thanks.

comment: HI [~lina]-Is it possible to have the report be available as an excel document? Rather than a white page with a bunch of information?


author: JIRAUSER10914
comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com],

We can generate a CSV for them.  It would *require code change* and hence PR.

The resulting CSV file would look something like this.  Please let me know if the client wants to make a PR.

Thanks.

comment: Hi [~lina]- how much more programming hours will it take? I'll need to charge Sunrun before showing them the new format.

3 hours.

Does SURU want to change delivery preference of bounced email accounts to paper (at the time of report generation)?

Does the client want to go through with it?

Can you confirm that we are generating the Bounceback report for the client only?  And no internal Bounceback report for IS?

comment: [~lina]- Report only goes to SURU and myself.

comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid],

This is ready for testing on stage.  I have already triggered bounced email to generate data for this report.  Please follow the following steps to run the report.

1. Log into PUI stage.  http://pui-stage.infoimageinc.com/login.jsp
2. DPJS -> Report Schedule
3. Type in "SURU" then Submit.
4. You should see a report schedule titled "SURU Monthly Bounceback Report".
5. Let's update the email for this report schedule so that you receive the reminder email to pickup the report.  Click on Edit.  Change "Confirm Email" to your email.  Click Submit.  Click Continue.  Click Continue again.
6. We will now run the report.  Click Run.  Select "Yes, please start it immediately." and click Submit.  Click Continue.
7. You should receive an email with subject "SURU: Your e-mail Bounceback Report is Available for Download".
8. Please let me know at this point to retrieve the report for you.
9. The report should be "|" delimited file.

Thanks.

We can't run the Bounceback Report for the past 30 days for SURU.  The API call would time out.

We can do either weekly or daily report for them.  Would that work?

Regards.
Lin


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: Hi [~lina],

When we run the bounceback report for the past 30 days, it will collect ALL bounced emails from ALL applications correct?

And I thought we could run the past 30 days? What do you mean about the API timing out?


author: JIRAUSER10914
comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com],

We can run 30 days for lower environments.  But on prod, SURU has a great many email jobs that API does not return the result in a timely manner resulting in "504 Gateway Time-out" error.

Regards.
Lin


author: JIRAUSER10914
comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com],

Shall I proceed with setting up the Bounceback report for "past 7 days that runs weekly" or "past 14 days that runs every other week"?

Lin


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~lina]- Wait, so if we run the bounceback report, we will get 504 errors? Or will that only happen if we try to process past jobs?

Also, can you set it up to run every month that runs the past 30 days? Or is that too many days?


author: JIRAUSER10914
comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com],

When I tried to run the Bounceback report that covers the past 30 days on Friday, the report timed out.  If I try to run it again today that covers the past 30 days, it is ok.  It is a matter of how many email jobs and the volume that were ran in the past 30 days.

For SURU, it is not workable if the report can run for some 30-days windows and not for others.  That is why I want to see if SURU is amendable to lowering the number of days that the report covers.

If they insist on getting the report that covers that past 30 days, I can give them one today.  However a future report may fail to run.

Regards.

author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~lina]- Got it. I'll confirm with SURU in our mtg today.




author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~lina]- Can it be set to daily?


author: JIRAUSER10914
comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com],

I have configured it to run daily starting tomorrow at 7AM and the report covers 1 day.
