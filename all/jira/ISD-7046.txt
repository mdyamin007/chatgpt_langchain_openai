I've run the client's sample file on pilot and it looks good.

I'll have the process ready to run the client files on production by 5/27.


author: dyuen
comment: [~Ethan.Yu], please confirm how we will provide samples. Also please provide to QA for testing. The live date may be pushed back since ELCU will need to test as well.

comment: [~dyuen],

No samples will be provided. A sample of the file format was supposed to be provided, but it looks like the client was able to provide a successful file.



If the client wants to review that the changes are correct. They can provide a new sample file, and confirm on pilot after we run that the delivery preferences of the account number list is changed back to paper.



[~Igor.Khosid], since this is a standard process we've had for years I don't believe QA will be required for this project.

comment: Hi [~dyuen],

I've released to production for the scanner to automatically trigger and process the:

elcu_RevertToPaper_mmddyyyy.txt file that the client sends over.



We'll need network to create the "revert_to_paper" inside elcu's secure4 folder.

Afterwards let's ask the client to send over a file today or tomorrow and i'll monitor that it was processed correctly.



Thanks

comment: Hi [~Ethan.Yu], I checked with Network and that folder was already created/exists. I updated the ticket asking ELCU to send a file over.
