According to redtitan_error.log, program found the matching afp file at same folder as the csv file.

/d/daily/rwcudna/rwcudn401red.csv

/d/daily/rwcudna/rwcudn401red.afp

So it was not problem in afp path.



There was actually other mismatches issue as follow:

[02/24/2022 11:53:57] - prod - /d/daily/rwcudna/rwcudn401red.afp
DP,

There was an error while verify the total number of PDF pages vs the total number of AFP pages.

Expected PDF page count is: 44
Retutned AFP page count is: 42

The AFP file is located at /d/daily/rwcudna/rwcudn401red.afp.
Please contact the IS Department to research why there is a discrepancy.



This mismatch was saw by DP and will be addressed in other Jira ticket IS-768.

So we can close this ticket.
