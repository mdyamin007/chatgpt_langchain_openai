title: FRST - Stmt - Annual LoanPDFi Conversion to AFP2PDF Python [InHse]
description: Update existing processing script to no longer use PDFi tool to create pdf.
 Instead use afp2pdf.py program with index_build_multicore option for ALL statement related apps.
 The smaller daily notice jobs can use the current index_build options.

All the zip file, pgp encryption, index file contents, and PDF file naming convention must remain exactly the same original specifications.

Please ensure the standard SOP on the directory structure must be followed: 
 ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/pdf, ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/zip, ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/work is followed.
 Also, clear the folder directory folder before each processing. We do NOT want to accumulate previous runs.

The current program should support checking total PDF counts verification to make sure the expected pdf matches the total number for pdfs generated; If not, incorporate this standard verification logic

DT_JOB_ID:
 133582-C00.01-V21315

Processing Scripts to modify:
 frstyl1_process.sh



*NOTE*: This job runs on RH2. Since we are migrating from RHS to RH2, we should test all options so that we can do afpcompare and also ensure there is no errors in the processing logs.

comment: [~William.Kong], this process uses red titan. DSi don't have the knowledge (think also permission) to run this process. 
It will be better to assign this to someone with redtitan experience. 

Let me know if you still want us to continue. 

Thanks,
Anwar

comment: QA:

Project exported to/d/iss/qa/FRST/FRSTYL11.zip.

Parallel ID:20220727162214

I did not see PDF in production, so I generated PDF via PDFI in parallel.

These PDFI PDFs are in/z/pdf_afp/frst/frstyl1_pdfi/.

Sample AFP2Web version in:

/z/pdf_afp/frst/frstyl1/

comment: [~Andrey.Kutsenko]: Sorry for the delayed response! Apparently I missed quite a lot of emails last week. This is good to pass.



[~jira_naru]: Please code release for this project and inform DP that this application is good to process on RHS server moving forward. I'm going to change the due date for today.
