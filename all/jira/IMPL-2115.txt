description: TITLE: FCBT - PLBA: Separate processing segments for 'Simple Bill' and 'Simple Bill Statement' files

Application: LIQ Simple Bills







Description:

Permanent update to separate processing of files for 'LIQ Simple Bills'.

Currently, we process two file names together (if received):



SIMPLE BILL: <CID>_liq_simpbill_<exportID>_<MMDDYYYY>.txt.pgp

SIMPLE BILL STATEMENT: <CID>_liq_simpbillstmt_<exportID>_<MMDDYYYY>.txt.pgp



Recommendation to process as different segments if possible:

Simple Bill as Segment 01 - 10.

Simple Bill Stmt as Segment 11 - 20.



*IS ASSESSMENT:*

2hr - Update Script fcbt_lq1_process_wrapper.sh

2hr - Update Script fcbt_lq1_process.sh

5hr - Testing all 15 associations

Total = 9hrs - IS hours  + Zero ISD hours



*NOTES FOR DEVELOPER:*

Please update scripts: fcbt_lq1_process_wrapper.sh & fcbt_lq1_process.sh. Add coding logic that will make sure each datafile is ran with the correct segment, for example:

If datafile =<CID>_liq_simpbill_<exportID>_<MMDDYYYY>.txt.pgp(Simple Bill), then make sure the segment is 1 - 10.

If datafile =<CID>_liq_simpbillstmt_<exportID>_<MMDDYYYY>.txt.pgp (Simple Bill Statement), then make sure the segment is 11 - 20.



Set and test crontab with 2 entries. One to to be set as segment 1 for Simple Bill and the other set as segment 11 for the Simple Bill Statement.



NOTE: Client only sends 1 segment per day, in the event any extra segments are sent, they will need to be processed manually.
