title: UFCU - [25095][pvt] Missing Information on Indirect Welcome Letter (017)
description: On the Indirect Welcome Letters (017) we have noticed that for the payment coupons on page 2 of the letter, the Member Name is not populating.


Per client in this instance use "Name" field to get the member name.


We will update the mapping and will provide you on jira. This is the timeline considering parallel testing...



On Indirect Welcome Letters (017) page 2, update to populate Member Name.
*Waived due to mapping oversight during Implementation

comment: [~tanmay]: Please review and work on this ticket.



[~Bryanl]: We may need to push the timeline by one day since this ticket was just assigned to Tanmay. The assignee was not set to Tanmay until just now so he was not alerted last night unfortunately. I hope UFCU is ok to shift timeline by adding one extra day to the original timeline below. I have a 7:30am meeting with Tanmay on a different project so i can follow-up with him to ensure samples are created by tomorrow instead of today.
