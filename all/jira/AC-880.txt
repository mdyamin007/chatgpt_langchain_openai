title: DACB - [27195][pvt] 2022 Tax Forms paper and E
description: -------------------per Shun------------------------------

5 hours to perform the following:

- Setup etax tab on both the member site and InfoTRAC via InfoConfig

- Enable etax email template on InfoTRAC Client Management settings.

- Add DACB to the Etax Processing-UI code

- Configure etax processing on the PUI and test emails.

- Setup the AOLP flag and test

- Setup etax paperless report (aka paperless file for IS). At the moment this will not change anything, but would be good to setup in advance in case they want to have selective paperless sometime in the future.



This requires code release and server restart on our end, so by our new SOP we aim to have everything ready on stage for QA to test at least a week before releasing to production on a Wednesday. We can follow most of the IS timeline, however I noticed IS provided a live date of 9/16 which is a Friday. I think Wednesday, 9/21 would be a more suitable live date for us.

Per sow, it says data file account willl be used for posting. So don't need any xfer file to account -> member conversion . Also don't need invalid address report but only archival.

Masking is needed for ssn, per sow.

Follow any tax archival set up script mfcu_customized_archival.pl or ufcu_customized_archival.pl. Refer to sow for archival requirement.

And need to make a soft link of that script to $dir/tax/prep/dacb/ like below.*Make sure while releasing production you give this instructions to make soft link.*
