comment: [~dawnl] I setup and tested the ECL file process with our internal pilot scanner and it is working. I tested with this file VWCU_ECL_12152021.txt, which they sent us a few months ago. If they would like to verify the email changes with a new file, then I can take it and move it to our pilot scanner for processing. Let me know how they would like to proceed.

Here is the feedback from client:

"I have attached a test file from 2 weeks back that was created and run from our core team. It has the correct ECL format for you, but does have all our members with blank emails. Would that be a problem? "

Please see comment #39 in TS#27142 for the new test file since it is too big to attach in jira.

comment: [~dawnl] that's fine, any line with no account or email address will just be skipped. I just ran it through our internal pilot scanner and it looks to be running, I'll update again when it's done.

comment: [~dawnl] the file VWCU_ECL_04212022.txt is processed on pilot now.

Can you answer client's questions below?

"I have access to pilot but I'm not sure which accounts would have been updated for me to reference and check against. I know there were a lot of users in the list we provided. Can you let us know how many changed?

Can you also let us know how the delivery process should be set up once this is validated? I would like to have it in place by EOM if at all possible to account for April statement notifications. "

1. Pilot data is not synced with production, so the counts on pilot are probably significantly higher than if we were to run it on production. In terms of testing, the email address only shows up on Infotrac if there is an enrolled user, so I found a few they can validate:

861987:
Old email: Meg.Phelan@bottomline.com
New email: jordan.hernandez@vantagewest.org

890221:
Old email: gonzaleza7279@gmail.com
New email: saenzga65@gmail.com

979534:
Old email: deannamichell@icloud.com
New email: none@vantagewest.org

2. All they need to do is drop off the file into the secure FTP folder where all their other files are dropped off. Firstly, I still need to setup the production scanner to trigger the ECL file automatically. Once we get client pilot approval, I can pass it onto QA for final validation before making the changes on production. We can definitely release to production this week before EOM if we get client approval within the next couple days.

Can you confirm the file naming convention for them? Should it stay as VWCU_ECL_MMDDYYYY ?

See client's feedback below.

"Thank you for the info. We are good to proceed with getting this ready for the live site. Our team has this in code review today and they can have it installed this week. They will be dropping the file monthly into the FTP so it is updated for EOM statement notices. Also, can you confirm the file naming convention for them? Should it stay as VWCU_ECL_MMDDYYYY ?"

comment: [~dawnl] thanks, I'll try to get this ready for QA on stage today.

As for the filename, please have them continue sending the file as VWCU_ECL_MMDDYYYY.txt

comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid], this is an ECL file setup which is used to update email addresses. I've ran this file VWCU_ECL_04212022.txt on stage via scanner and it should be finished on PUI stage now. Can you have someone check a few accounts on InfoTRAC stage Account Management tab to see if the email addresses are updated? I've provided a few below:

comment: Thanks [~Igor.Khosid]
[~dawnl] I can have it setup on production by tomorrow. I'll update here when it's done.

comment: [~dawnl] I've released my updates to production, our scanner should be able to automatically run their ecl files whenever they drop it off to the secure folder.
