It is attached.

Thanks, Barnett  [^SSCU_DL_Print_SOW_8.21.22.docx] 


author: JIRAUSER11103
comment: [~barnetts]This SOW was for the old application, sscudla, prior to the core conversion to Fiserv DNA and has different letter numbers compared to the current application, sscudle.

The new one should be:[http://sharepoint-svr/AS/Shared%20Documents/SOW%20Directory/SSCU%20-%20Safe%20Credit%20Union/Fiserv%20DNA%20Core%20Conversion/SOW/SSCU_DailyNotice_FiservDNA_Core_PRINT_SOW.docx]


author: barnetts
comment: Hi [~Natalie.Tom],

It is attached.  Please assign an open DL Number. It looks like 126 is open.
 [^SSCU_DailyNotice_FiservDNA_Core_PRINT_SOW.docx] 
Thanks, Barnett


author: JIRAUSER11103
comment: [~barnetts]Okay this letter will be 126.

From the letter template, is "<credit card type>" in the sentence "We noticed that we have not yet received a payment on your <credit card type>." going to use the field "ProductName" in the data file? I didn't see a "credit card type" header in the data file.

Can you also confirm that the Account Number is the "AccountID" in the data file and not "MemberNumber"?


author: barnetts
comment: Hi [~Natalie.Tom],

I will follow up on this.

Thanks, Barnett 


author: JIRAUSER11103
comment: [~barnetts]From the assessment, this is "Print ONLY"


author: barnetts
comment: Hi [~Natalie.Tom],

NOTE: Since there are 2 letters being added to the same application, the same parallel ID is being used and was tested at the same time. The other Jira ticket number is IS-1363.

[~barnetts]Looking at the updated SOW letters 126 and 127 are confirmed to be print only, but the column for enotice is 'Y' for both. Please update that.
