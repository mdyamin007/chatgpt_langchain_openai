Notes for assigned developer (Please add to JIRA Story and Epic):

- Use and modify the INI and EE used for PLBKDN404 (plbkdn404.ee & plbkdn404.ini). This is ran on the Iswk3 server 124.

- Use prefix plbkdn408 for INI and EE and also to update letter code table in plbkdna_redtitan.control. The verbiage "Loan Rate Change Notice" can be used for description.

- Use file pattern provided by customer to update pdf pattern table and letter code table in plbkdna_redtitan.control.

- This app uses 2 DFA's for all 7 letters. PLBKDNP11.dfa is used for the simplex letters and PLBKDNP21.dfa is used for duplex letters. Please use PLBKDNP11.dfa since this will be a simplex letter.

comment: [~Bryanl], I was out sick since this Jira got turned over to IS but it was not assigned to Rukmani (programmer). It should be assigned to programmer right away if programmer is assigned on the team support ticket. I don't think Rukmani will be able to make the 6/9 live date anymore. Please advice.

Please provide new timeline and I will let client know. Thank you, my understanding was IS would assign programmer for IS JIRA. Next time I will immediately assign to Rukmani if ticket indicates that

Parallel passed. Please release the update to production today (6/17/2022)

Here is client's comment:

"Do we have any update on whether we will be live by EOD today?

Thank you so much for making that push for us. Like I mentioned yesterday, today's file is quite large because of the fed rate change, so it will be a huge relief to have that processed by InfoImage. I'll have our team send it through the FTP. With the timing of things, I believe it will reach you for processing either over the weekend or by Tuesday morning."

Thanks.
