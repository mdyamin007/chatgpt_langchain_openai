title: BKPL - DL Update - Phase 1.5
description: Post Launch Items to update


 * Add the JH file name to the Daily Notice DPVS breakdown (possibly next to the notice name in parentheses). CD2160P, etc.
 * Add "InfoIMAGE" to the DPVS.
 * Send DPVS as a .txt or PDF.
 * Add[stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com|mailto:stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]to the email of the dpvs.
 * Shrink logo and return address so they're seen through the top window.
 * EP6600 code needs to be updated to handle multipage notice based following criteria:

 # *FEE AMOUNT See Last Page* #Look for this verbiage on Page 1
 # The account number value would remain across all the pages.


 * See attached. LN's are printing "www.bankplus.net" and "Equal Housing Lender" verbiage on top right under data and page number. BKPL would like the same done for DL's.
