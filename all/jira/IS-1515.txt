This is the previous state of/*d/iss/Terrence/2021_tax/tax_sql/tax_insert_table.sql*

!image-2022-09-30-16-50-27-797.png!

and here is the updated*/d/iss/Terrence/2021_tax/tax_sql/tax_insert_table.sql*

!image-2022-09-30-16-51-02-442.png!



You will notice that it is using rule 30,28,64 and 2 for index.

Rule 30 and 64 are only used by slcu. So we can change the rule directly to change the 5th column from 0 to 1 in tax_acctnum_main table. This 5th column is used for removal or not removal the leading zeros.

Rule 28 is being used by multiple cid. So we need to make a new rule only to make the 5th column from 0 to 1 in tax_acctnum_main_table and used that rule no in tax_acctnum_ref table.

And use rule 1 instead of rule 2 for rest of the form in tax_acctnum_ref_table.
