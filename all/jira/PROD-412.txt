title: fix issues with TKCU monthly report
description: TKCU montly script had relied on old oracle prod server (10.8.14.23) due to unix odbc driver producing results with embedded spaces. However, the old oracle prod server was shutdown due to hardware failure, per Kent. In order to allow TKCU monthly report to run correctly, this issue needs to be fixed.

|Hi Kent,

Yes any windows server would be fine, and probably better than trying to debug unix odbc driver.

Thank you

Hey Jun

Do you just need to use the driver? We have an virtual windows server that we are using for AppDynamics DB reporting that you can use if that's all you need?

10.8.14.16 is an older server which I would like to retire shortly

Thanks!

Hi David,

The tkcu report is running on the new centos db server. However, due to odbc driver issues, it was using odbc driver installed on old prod db server to access sql server. I will check to see if the linux server odbc driver can be fixed. If not, I guess I can install odbc driver on another windows server (such as 10.8.14.16) and use that instead.

Thank you

Jun

Jun,

What do we need to do to migrate the TKCU's report over?

Thanks

Hi Jun

The server had crashed as there was two bad drives and was not recoverable. We were not aware there was still an application utilizing it.

Is there anything we can do to create a new much smaller instance for this purpose?

Thanks!

Hi Kent,

Was this server shutdown? I am not able to connect to it any longer.
It was still being used for tkcu monthly reporting job (as odbc driver wasn't working properly on centos).
If it's shutdown and decommed, odbc driver issue on linux will have to be resolved.

Thank you
