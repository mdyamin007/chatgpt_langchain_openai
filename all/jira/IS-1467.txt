Do you have the sample ready today (8/26/2022) for QA as scheduled ?

comment: Hi [~dawnl],

Piece code is missing for this job which prevent me processing on parallel. I'm requesting it from PC.  The sample should be ready as soon as PC solved the issue.

Thanks,
Tevis

comment: [~Tevis Mak]/ [~dawnl]: Can we get client commitment to go live by 9/12? If not, we will need to pause this project by one month as we need to add logic to update them to run use a different PDF Archival software to create the PDF. The server in early weeks of September.



[~Tevis Mak] / [~Peter.Dang]: [~anwarh]informed me that he cannot work on this application to convert from PDFi to AFP2PDF. Can Tevis take over to use AFP2PDF since he is actively working on this project. If client cannot commit to 9/12, we need to comment out the changes Tevis made for this project.

author: william.kong
comment: [~Tevis Mak]/[~dawnl]: Now the QA completed their part, please advise when this project will go live.



We have another project (i.e. Project 64B) where we need merge our changes after you go live. Please advise if the target live date will be EOM. Right now, Jira due date is Sep 12 so I have no clue what the real live date is.



[~terrencet]/[~Peter.Dang]: FYI. [~anwarh]needs to work on merging his change for Project 64B, but this project is holding it up. If live date is TBD, then we may need to roll his changes into his DFA first to not further prolong the live date. In the meantime, I've asked him to put his changes to the new version that is in parallel.

comment: [~avannik]- the print sample is ready. See the email from TXOPS. Please check. Thanks.


author: JIRAUSER11700
comment: Print sample attached >>>[^IS-1328_SHBK_PrntSmpl_10252022_TX.pdf]

For some reason, it does not have IMB barcode: -must be some error in printing-it was a wrong afp file.

Print samples I generated before using dpvs above,[^IS-1328_SHBK_PrntSmpl_10212022.pdf]do have IMB barcode so the project must be ok.
