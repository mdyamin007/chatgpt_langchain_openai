title: HTBK - Invoice - Safe Deposit Box BillPDFi Conversion to AFP2PDF Python [InHse]
description: Update existing processing script to no longer use PDFi tool to create pdf.
 Instead use afp2pdf.py program with index_build_multicore option for ALL statement related apps.
 The smaller daily notice jobs can use the current index_build options.

All the zip file, pgp encryption, index file contents, and PDF file naming convention must remain exactly the same original specifications.

Please ensure the standard SOP on the directory structure must be followed: 
 ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/pdf, ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/zip, ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/work is followed.
 Also, clear the folder directory folder before each processing. We do NOT want to accumulate previous runs.

The current program should support checking total PDF counts verification to make sure the expected pdf matches the total number for pdfs generated; If not, incorporate this standard verification logic

comment: [~rodriguez]: Sorry to do this you, but I added one additional requirement to test and make sure this program can run via RHS server instead of RH2. Please ensure there is no error message. Please choose a more+recent+ production cycle to test all options.+Save+ a copy of the production pdf archival files because we will compare the parallel PDF files with the production version with the same cycle.

comment: [~William.Kong]No problem. I just tested on both servers. Sending to QA now.
