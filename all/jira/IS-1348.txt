Thank you so much for getting this done. I noticed on the dummy sample that "Fort Hood" is in the last line of that first paragraph; is that something you can change to "First Heroes", or do we need that from the client?

Thank you,

Keri

comment: Thank you, [~andyp]

That whole paragraph in the dummy pdf was pulling from current production message manager.  Once customer change it it will reflect in the statement.
