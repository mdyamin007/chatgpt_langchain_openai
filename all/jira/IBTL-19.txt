title: Perl Module Net::SSL Installation Issue
description: On RHS, the following perl programs references Net::SSL:




{noformat}
[williamK@bb-rhs perl]$ grep -irH 'Net::SSL' /home/master/*
/home/master/ConnectwareAddr.pm:use Net::SSL;
/home/master/ConnectwareBalance.pm:use Net::SSL;
/home/master/MsgCriteria.pm:use Net::SSL;{noformat}




I know for sure, we are no longer using the following to perl modules as they were solely used by RABO as an API to communicate to FIS's Connectware API to pull customer address information from Core for their IRD checks:
{noformat}
/home/master/ConnectwareAddr.pm:use Net::SSL;
/home/master/ConnectwareBalance.pm:use Net::SSL;{noformat}


However, I think we are still referencing the following code for the Message Manager code.
{noformat}
/home/master/MsgCriteria.pm:use Net::SSL;{noformat}


If I review the contents of this MsgCriteria.pm perl module, I don't see any Net::SSL related coding. If my assessment is correct, please+delete+ the 'use Net::SSL;' line of code and test it.



If there are no issue, please release to production before the Brisbane move.
