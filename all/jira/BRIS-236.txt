title: External IP for Click Track
description: Ferhat/Kent,

We need to have external IP for Click Track on both Menlo and BB as this is a live product.
|*CID/System*|*URL Hostname*|*BB Test Hostname*|
|Clk infotrac|Clk-prod-mm.infoimageinc.com|clicktrack-common.infoimageinc.com|

Thanks

From ca-proxy-pr-17 and ca-proxy-pr-18 can you give port access of 3005 to ca-hypercube-pr-01, 02 and 03.

telnet is still not working. I have checked destination servers and application is running on port 3005.
