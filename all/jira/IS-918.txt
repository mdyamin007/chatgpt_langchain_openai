title: APCU - [27054][pvt] Changes to 1st Mortgage Statement
description: Assessment Details (IS):
- Parallel required: (Yes)

- APCU 1st Mortgage (apcuml4) -> APCUML41.dfa

- Use their 02/17 file as a test file



Add New partial Payment Comment, 2hr.
 -- Record "B" field 25, the message contains contains hex '0A' control character between
   the 2 message. This is an issue for our format program since hex '0A' is record delimiter
   and will cause record "B" to split.
   Therefore, will need to do preprocessing to fix record "B".
 -- The messages can be split by '*' character or similar means (developer's choice)
  
2. Misc Fees & FCL/Bank fees are 1hr.
 -- TOT_FEES_CHARGE value is currently from record "B" field 11.
   New TOT_FEES_CHARGE = record "B" field 11 + record "I" field 8 + record "I" field 9
  
3. Add a new Billing Rights Statement Message 1hr.
  -- Message should be in a box.
  -- Message should be the footer on the second page, meaning will always be at bottom
   of second page.
Hours for development: 4 IS hours

Please ask the client to search with these names:

ARTHUR H. L. FROM & SUZANNE PAINE
DEAN A. COX
SHIRLEY K. ISAACSON
EUGENE J. AUGE & GLENDA R. AUGE

Thanks

Please see the information and questions from client below.

The problem is that this is a massive PDF file with 34,364 pages. Searching take a very long time because as time goes on, it slows down. This is probably due to the amount of memory being used for Adobe to search, but I was searching for Randall L Olson for over 40 min without finding it and Adobe had only gotten through 11k pages of the 34k+ when I finally stopped and asked for the single statement in InfoCare.



I can ask that the team search for the names listed below but I dont feel like this is an efficient use of anyones time. I dont understand why an individual statement (or one for each of the names below) cannot be provided. You all create individual statements each month for us.



Can anyone provide us with a page number where these names or Randall L Olson show up in the PDF? If so, then its no problem.

Client has requested an additional change to these statements. Does this add more hours of programming? And they would like to know if we would be able to Go Live by 04/18/22. Please see their request below.

[^Billing Rights Statement-REV for InfoImage.docx]

We have one final change to the Billing Statement box. We need to add our address.

I have attached a new word doc that lists exactly what needs to be listed. Again, this is all to be placed in teh box at the bottom of the 2nd page.



We are aware that this has dramatically affected the go-live date, but is it possible to still have this completed before this month's run (it will be sent on the 18th).



Please let me know if there are any questions, thank you again!

comment: Hi Hamimul,

Customer responded to the sample - see attached file:

We found one last tweak to the wording of the Billing Statement (see highlighted below). This should be the last adjustment.

I've also attached an updated Word doc in case that is more helpful.
