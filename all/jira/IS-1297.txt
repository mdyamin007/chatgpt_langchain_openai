comment: [~Natalie.Tom]- From Enrico's email, VISA samples are approved. Please provide DPVS for print samples when ready and move forward with preparing for QA when you are able to.

[~Igor.Khosid] - FYI, samples are approved.

Note that the approved sample PDF's are too large to attach to this ticket - here is the location of the APPROVED samples (I've noted in the description as well for tracking):

/ac-secure-share/ba/enrico/SACU_VISA_APPROVED_Samples.pdf

[~kericapote] When you return, please work with Enrico to ensure that the SOW is updated and finalized for QA.

[~enricob] FYI

Just to follow up, can you answer these questions:

From above:Can the rewards file content be same when they send a new one or will it always be different?

From a previous email: what does the 5.mis/5.rpt mean? Right now its set to rtm.


author: enricob
comment: Can the rewards file content be same when they send a new one or will it always be different? Could be the same on some accounts if there were no activities.



what does the 5.mis/5.rpt mean? Right now its set to rtm.  Keri might know about this. That might be from the old SOW. Follow the one in the old program.


author: kericapote
comment: [~enricob] I don't show Visa uses 5.mis/5.rpt.  Where do you see that it does?  Also who are you asking about the rewards file?

 1. Due to lack of time, message manager wasn't set up and will be included at another time.
 2. Per previous messages with Enrico, the "520 only exist starting august dates butsince we need to support pre-conversion data, then we need to do both" so this means that some accounts will have transactions in record 530 or 520 and some will have both 530 and 520.
 3. Looking at the data for the "Transaction date" is displayed under "Posting Date" screenshot, that's not what's happening. That account has 2 record 530s for those 2 transactions and go under posting date since the transaction dates aren't different from the posting date.
4. From #2, some accounts will have 520 and some will have 530 or both. The 520 dates go with the 520 descriptions and amount and the same goes for 530.
5. You're pointing the mapping to the sample incorrectly. You pointed the value for "INTEREST CHARGED FOR THE PERIOD" to the transaction amount.

comment: Hi Gnana, I added the reward point file to the Jira ticket.


author: JIRAUSER11103
comment: [~gthillaivel]
Previous calculation does match.
580(10) is actually6916, 580(11) is 507501 and there is no value in 582(02) so 6916+507501=514417 and the last 2 digits are cents so 5,144.17 is correct.
