Hi everyone,



We have a new law in effect in California called the California Consumer Protection Act that is important for us to review. It went into effect January 1st, 2020 and enforcement begins July 1st, 2020. It will affect Marketing, Sales, and Product Development.



*Summary from a non-attorney:*
 * Affects emails sent to and from California
 * You must comply if you are a for-profit that meets at least one of the following conditions:
 * Your business annual revenue is over $25 million.
 * Your business receives information of over 50,000 consumers, households, or devices annually.
 * At least half of your business annual revenue comes from selling personal information.


 * A fine up to $7,500 for each intentional violation and $2,500 for each unintentional violation (Cal. Civ. Code  1798.155)
 * [What marketers need to know|https://jira.infoimageinc.com/secure/UrlBlockedError.aspx]

 * Identify our level of compliance

*It only takes one person reporting us to have to deal with this regulation.*

comment: [~Bryanl] - can you find out how this would affect our business. I don't think it will because we aren't the ones collecting the data but we are using the data that was collected by our clients for InfoREACH.
