comment: [~dyuen] Apparently there's some issues with updating the verbiage on pilot at the moment, so for now I've put the verbiage onto stage. I attached a screenshot elcu_tax_verbiage.png since elcu won't be able to login to our stage environment. Let me know if this is ok.

comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima], ELCU approved! Please confirm once the verbiage has been updated.

Note: ELCU will also need the verbiage remove once their tax files have been processed/posted.

Thanks!

comment: Thanks [~dyuen] that was quick, in that case I'll try to release to production near EOD today. I'll provide another update then.

comment: [~dyuen] This should be released onto production now.

comment: [~dyuen] In terms of removing the verbiage after taxes have been processed, did they just want it removed or reverted back to the original verbiage from before? Also please let me know when to do this so I can prep for release. Thanks!


author: dyuen
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima], ELCU confirmed they would like the verbiage removed entirely on 2/1/2022. Thanks!
