title: PLBK - 20633 - Return Slip & Envelope Window [20633][pvt][Summary]
description: We are receiving reports that the return slip for our loan payments is not lining up in the return envelope correctly. Users are having to fold the bottom part of the slip to get the entire return address to fit. The slip currently only shows "Quincy, Ca 95971" in the window.

Please let me know who i need to work with to get this corrected. Attached is a sample.
