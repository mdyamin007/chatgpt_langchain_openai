comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid],

I updated the disclosure title and content in Step 2 of the enrollment steps and on the Disclosure tab after logging in. Please SSO onto stage and verify that the content and title matches the eStatement_Disclosure_Final.pdf attached to this story. 

WASH has a unique way of SSO, therefore please use the following UniqueID on stage: a8a0e95e617256c599b8f9ef6f5502d2

You should receive a key value. In the next section, please copy that key into the ConnectionString field and copy the same UniqueID from above into the UniqueID field.

Let me know if you have any questions or run into any issues.
