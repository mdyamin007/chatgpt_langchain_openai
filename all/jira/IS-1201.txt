title: HTBK - Letter - DailyPDFi Conversion to AFP2PDF Python [InHse]
description: Update existing processing script to no longer use PDFi tool to create pdf.
 Instead use afp2pdf.py program with index_build_multicore option for ALL statement related apps.
 The smaller daily notice jobs can use the current index_build options.

All the zip file, pgp encryption, index file contents, and PDF file naming convention must remain exactly the same original specifications.

Please ensure the standard SOP on the directory structure must be followed: 
 ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/pdf, ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/zip, ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/work is followed.
 Also, clear the folder directory folder before each processing. We do NOT want to accumulate previous runs.

The current program should support checking total PDF counts verification to make sure the expected pdf matches the total number for pdfs generated; If not, incorporate this standard verification logic

Processing Scripts to modify:
 htbk_dl_process.pl

Data Files to use:
 htbk_dla_04302021_1.7z



*NOTE*: This job runs on RH2 server. Since we are migrating from RH2 server to RHS, please test ALL job_sel options to ensure RHS can run with error messages in the processing log files.

Couldn't find the data file specified above, so used the following
htbk_dla_07292022_1.7z (/z/dsi_pdfi_testing/htbkdla/data)

pdfs are kept at: /z/dsi_pdfi_testing/htbkdla/new/

Thanks,

comment: [~anwarh]: The PDFi production version has this extra file:

htbk_08012022__019_00001.pdf

I've placed this file into/d/ac-secure-share/dsi_print/anwarH/htbk/is-1201/ for you to look at. Is it because Letter 19 does not have account number and the logic is to concatenate all letter 19 documents into one big pdfhtbk_08012022__019_00001.pdf?

comment: [~anwarh]: Would you please provide an update on why the original programming has the extra PDF file as mentioned in the comment above compared to the new version. Please advise.

comment: Hi [~William.Kong], [~Igor.Khosid],

Not sure if this was intended or an issue with our setup.

Whatever it is, I manually handled this scenario to behave exactly like the old script.

Note that in a normal scenario, afp2pdf would have still generated multiple pdf without account numbers as the sequence number would have been different. Also, there would have multiple entries in the index file. where currently there is none.
