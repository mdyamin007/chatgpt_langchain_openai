title: SANA - 33945 - Check Images not displaying from Statements
description: Since SANA has enabled API Feature, we cannot provide check links on statements anymore. Due to the fact that check links require a login, either from hypercube or infotrac credentials. APIs do not have the credential requirements for check links. Therefore I have to remove check link feature from the statements.

To QA:
1. On PUI find a check index file processing job.
2. Find an account number with a check index.
3. Go onto InfoTRAC, search the account number. Open up the statement.
4. Try to open the check link hyperlink. If it doesn't, then that means we've correctly removed the check images on the statements.
