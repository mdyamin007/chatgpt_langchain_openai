S- Record (MSP/P309)  
              Transaction date:           
If Proc-Date (S record positions 124-129 (YYMMDD)) not zeros or spaces
              Use Proc-Date (S record pos 124-129) for the transaction date
Otherwise
              Use Disb-Proc-Date (S record positions 1006-1011 (CYY packed, MMDD)) for the transaction date.
 W- Record (MSP/PSH)  
              Transaction date:        
If Proc-Date (W record positions 124-129 (YYMMDD)) not zeros or spaces
              Use Proc-Date (W record pos 124-129) for the transaction date
Otherwise
              Use Disb-Proc-Date (W record positions 1006-1011 (CYY packed, MMDD)) for the transaction date
