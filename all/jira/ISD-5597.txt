comment: Mamunur, staging SSO is not working, can you please check, may be I need different host file entry.

I have in my host file:

10.8.11.87 chcustage.infoimageinc.com

Thank you,

Entry in the host file should be:

10.5.16.191 chcustage.infoimageinc.com

Also, you have to manually change pswd in sso test page. To do that inspect the element in sso test page and find the hidden input filed name="pswd".

Now change the value from #chcu2011# to$?ch4u2dTe

After that submit the form.

Thanks.
