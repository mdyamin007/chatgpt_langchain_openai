title: mailer-instant.infoimageinc.com  DNS Issue in subnet 10.5.20.###
description: [~kent.chan] and [~ferhat.doruk]:  When I ping mailer-instant.infoimageinc.com within the 10.5.20.### network, it returns the Menlo IP address:

10.8.9.228

The 10.4.20.### subnet is working fine. When I ping mailer-instant.infoimageinc.com it is returning the brisbane ip address of: 10.4.12.202



Can you find out why subnet 10.5.20.### is not working?



[~premraj.patil]: FYI.

comment: [~ferhat.doruk]: I did test from 10.5.20.39 which is within the list of servers you mentioned in your email. I tested again and it still does not work. i've included screenshots below. I believe it is a dns issue where mailer-instant.infoimageinc.com is still pointing to 10.8.9.228 IP address instead of10.4.12.202

comment: Hi Will,



I could not login to the server to troubleshoot.



Can you please confirm these servers are configured to use 10.4.32.11 and 10.4.32.12 as DNS servers.



Thanks.

comment: [~ferhat.doruk]: Any luck on this issue? I just checked again. the dns is still pointing to wrong IP for mailer-instant.infoimageinc.com under the 10.5.20.### network.

comment: [~ferhat.doruk] and [~premraj.patil]:  Here /etc/resolv.conf (i hope I'm looking at the right location), but I do see the dns server pointing correctly:

# Generated by NetworkManager
nameserver 10.4.32.11
nameserver 10.4.32.12
search infoimage.com
search infoimageinc.com

comment: [~ferhat.doruk]: It's working on the dev server. I will test the other server later. But I would consider it resolved. I also got the email as well. thanks!!!!! I'll close this ticket tomorrow.

comment: [~ferhat.doruk]: Closing this ticket out. Looks good as stated above. The mailer-instant.infoimageinc.com is also resolving correctly to 10.4.12.202 on the other dev server i just tested as well (ca-rhstore-dv-01)
