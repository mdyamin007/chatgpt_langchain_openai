title: InfoTRAC - Staging for AOLP
description: Hi David,



Just something I caught while going through the proofing module.

This drop down option uses bank, but it should be updated to something more generic, since this feature is used by both CU and Bank. This screenshot is actually from OFCU.



Is it possible to update to the Financial Institution, or something more generic?



Thanks!
 Phoebe
