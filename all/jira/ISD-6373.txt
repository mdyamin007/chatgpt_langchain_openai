title: EQBK - [25349][pvt] EQBK AUTH File Enhancement
description: EQBK would like to enhance the enrollment report to include:

Previous Status, so they know it was changed from E or Paper, or if it was a new account (so N to B).
Modified_By, so they know who changed the status, whether it be InfoIMAGE, the customer themselves, or a Bank employee.a
Previous status needs some programming. Modified_By can be enabled by configuration.



3 Hrs.

Turnover: 1/20

You said in the TS ticket 25349 that you would provide samples on Friday. The code was to Go Live today, and I still do not have samples for the client. Are they ready for review?
