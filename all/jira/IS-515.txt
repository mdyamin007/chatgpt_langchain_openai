I used the "wash_dda_10222021.zip" data file to test and got 1187 accounts will get insert from bin 2. Please let me know if that number looks correct or if there's another cycle I should check. I've attached DPVS "washds1122.print" for samples since it has the insert counts in there.

comment: [~jun], if everything looks OK, are we OK for a go live date of 11/2? Or do you think you can release earlier? Thanks


author: jun
comment: [~dyuen]Yes if everything is ok we can release early. However, for sample approvals, can we check with customer if1187 accounts will get insert from bin 2 look like correct number of accounts for"wash_dda_10222021.zip" data file?

comment: Forgot to update yesterday... I reached out to WASH for confirmation. I will follow up if I don't hear back later this morning/day. Thanks!

comment: Hi [~jun], I just received approval/confirmation from WASH (ticket #23469, comment 36):

"I have looked through the file for 10222021 and all looks good. The only minor code I didn't find was 17, (it is an account we open very little of) but I feel comfortable to go ahead with production for the inserts."

We should be good to proceed with code release. Please confirm once released.

Thanks!
