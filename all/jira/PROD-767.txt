title: Message Manager QA
description: QA Message Manager 4 on Staging.

Here is the video overview of how it should work: (Shared Drive)Z:\training\MM4 Demo. Note that on your machine, the shared drive might not be mapped exactly to Z:\. However, this is the same shared drive that everyone is using to share files.

Note that features shown in the video may now behave a little bit differently, but it should provide the gist of how the feature should work.

You will only be able to access this feature via the DEMO cid on Staging. There should be a Message Manager 4 tab.



There will be a detailed and more exact User Guide attached to this ticket later (hopefully Monday).
