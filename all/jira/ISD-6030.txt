comment: [~Igor.Khosid] [~gthillaivel], I've updated the disclosure tab on the SSO site. Please verify this on stage SSO with the below instructions:
* Use SSO test page to login on stage. All the prefilled information can be used.
* Once on the home page, there should be a Statements dropdown tab. Hover over it and you should see a Statement Disclosures tab at the bottom of the dropdown list. Click on that to open the disclosure for verification.
Note: I forgot to save the old disclosure, but from what I remember there were some changes made to the Electronic Funds Transfers section in the bottom half of the 1 page disclosure.

comment: Thanks [~barnetts]. 
Just wondering although the live date says 3/4, is it fine if I release the site backer update sooner? If so I was thinking maybe this wed 3/2, since that's our usual release day. If not that's fine, I can wait till 3/4 if necessary.


author: barnetts
comment: Hi [~Shun.Kuwashima],

Please release 3/2.

Thanks, Barnett

SANA is stating that they are not seeing the changes on the member site. I don't have access tot the member site. 
Can you please advise?
