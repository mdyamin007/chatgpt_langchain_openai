comment: Here is my comment:

UI/UX is a generic term, it has nothing to do with marketing campaign at all and not any function specific.


 # For UI, it should focus on how to bring the customer facing products (InfoREACH, InfoTRAC) to modern look and feel with consistent corporate color pallet, icons, and consistent navigation paradigm.
 # For UX, it should focus on the easy for users to find information and efficient way to navigate to the specific function/feature they are using.

3: UI/UX design need to put mobil device in mind, responsive design is just the beginning, due to the size of mobile device, the navigation and presentation of data can be totally different from desktop experience. So a good UI/UX designer will always consider both desktop and mobile at the same time.



Lastly, we should request portfolios of the UI/UX designer for we to review their past works.
