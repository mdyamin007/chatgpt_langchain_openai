title: GCBK - [33908][pvt] LN EA Pay- Suppression and Errors
description: Update logic to check if the last amount value (when it's not empty) on the Actual Escrow Balance column is 0.00 or not. If the
amount is 0.00, then logic will use the existing amount above the column (anywhere from 1 - 4 above, if it's not empty) to
verify if it is a negative amount of not.
Keep the mail code logic (SECOND_LAST_HIST_ACTUAL_ESCROW_BAL), yellow top right box and "payoff receipt".
Add new logic to exclude specified mail_code criteria 'A' to 'z' so that eSuppression will not overwrite them.

Usually their cycles come around the 25-30. Not sure if they want to hold until after code release or not.
