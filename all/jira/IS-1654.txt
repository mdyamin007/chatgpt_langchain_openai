Here is the client's feedback:





Ensure that the month populates:

Bullet point 4 is missing:

The apostrophe in Cashier's is showing up with a weird character:

2. Mailer ID rested for both

3. eSite - validated (admin site)
4. Control file - need to be updated (format should be {color:red}duplex {color}instead of {color:red}simplex{color}
5. Archival is not tested - please provide the location to the SOW (provided in the story SOW's not showing the archival naming convention)

_Control file - need to be updated (format should be{color:#FF0000}duplex{color}instead of_{color:#FF0000}_simplex_ -{color}The format in control file actually doesn't matter. If you check for FCSBDL042 it is also in duplex format but the control file is using simplex.

This doesn't have archival.
