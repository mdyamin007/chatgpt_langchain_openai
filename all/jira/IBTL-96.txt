comment: [~glenn.grimes]: Thanks for reporting the issue. I believe this issue is due to file checksum not being scanning into InfoTRAC database. We will need to place the datafile into /z/infoftp_int/$cid/folder/....



However, before I ask you to do so, I don't think the FTPScanner in stage is functioning b/c I still see file from yesterday.. I have a status meeting this morning to check in with ISD to confirm the status. Once i have my answers and confirmed that it works, i will re-assign ticket to you and ask you to place the file into the internal ftp scanner.

comment: [~glenn.grimes]: Please re-try. I confirmed the ftpscanner on parallel is working from David. Please copy the data file to the infoftp_int so that it can be scanned and then rerun the job.

Also, please re-assign ticket to let me know whether or not it worked. Thanks!

comment: [~glenn.grimes]: Can you try again? This is one of those weird situations where two ftpbu/hccu/dl or ftpbu/hccu/DL folders. The program is picking up the "DL" folder instead of the "dl" folder. I moved the file into /z/ftpbu/hccubu/DL folder.



I believe it should work now.
