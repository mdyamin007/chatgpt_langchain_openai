title: InfoImage Admin password reset functionality - IDCU #15816
description: Does the InfoImage Admin site that we use have any password reset functionality?

There is nothing currently showing on the login page but is this something that can be enabled?

If this feature does not exist, what will it take to get it implemented?



Kris,


What we would like is a Forgot Password link on the login page that allows the user to change their password or to request a new temporary password.



Thank you,
