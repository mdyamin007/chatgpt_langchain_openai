title: Automate start application services
description: Per Eric, over weekend we experienced a server crash. Webapp VM lots of app did NOT get auto restarted. Per Kent review to start automatically. Need the list of apps with David.


9/16:  Per Eric, he would like to have a cheat sheet on getting some of the services manually started manually if this situation happens in the future as DSi team will work on automating it.

9/30:  Some of the team is documenting the boot-up instructions in Confluence.  DSi will not be able to start mid-October.

10/21:  Due date changed to Feb 2020 as this is a required item to get it completed so that this process can be replicated for the move to Brisbane.
