comment: [~mousumiS] please change this to waiting for QA.  We need to get this into parallel asap as core conversion is today.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~kericapote] Based on moving this to QA, please be sure that this is ready for Igor. IS should move to QA when they have prepared the parallel ID, etc that is needed.
 # Make sure SOW link is up to date.
 # Attach identified APPROVED samples (there are a lot of PDF's attached), please group and/or name the correct set that Igor should use for QA to match with approved samples.
 # Confirm with BA that Mapping link is added/updated.
 # Be sure DPVS printed samples are provided/attached/requested from OPS.
 # Update correct due date - it still says 10/10. This all needs to be done before QA can begin.

Please do not turn over to QA without PRID!!
I consider that as QA blocked and unable to start the testing!!
