The page number is normal on back pages.

This logic is in the standard print module.

As far as the image not clear is because you are looking at a scanned pdf,IS-1102_SACU_PrntSmpls_08042022.pdf, which was scanned by laser department of the printed statement. If you look at the original print statement it is clear.

comment: Andrey checked the hard print samples,quality of the text in the footer looks good.Regarding the Page display,Calvin mentioned it's nothing to worry and the display of page # inside the box is fine.
Closing the bug as per above comments
