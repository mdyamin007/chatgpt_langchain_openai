title: SURU Electricity Statement PSID update
description: See attached updated mapping.Basically, we need to anchor only on FN, no ending on PSID anymore. So when you see more than 1 PSID, you will use this template.

This pertains to TS# 24694

Also, if SRD is missing, then beginning and ending date will be taken from the filename.

while solving this issue another data issue appeared which is causing failure of archival.

Same iid repetition where the archival pdf file name is <IID>.pdf so one pdf is replacing another.

[~enricob]already contacted with client about this and we are waiting for feedback.



Thanks
