title: Message Manager - Configuration Validation
description: We have to update code on Message manager message settings area. When someone try to add a statement symbol and save, we have to add some validation logic.


 * We should allow only 3 characters for statement symbol. No additional space leading or trailing should be allowed.
 * All letters should be lower case.
