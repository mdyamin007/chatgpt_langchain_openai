comment: [~shailendrar] While processing jobs, we connect to ca-proc-pr-02 machine for reading txt file contents. We except file structure to be as*/d/isd_share/banb/print_fileid.*When i verify folders on server, isd_share folder is present inside isd_share folder. So posting has failed. Below is the screen shot for same.
