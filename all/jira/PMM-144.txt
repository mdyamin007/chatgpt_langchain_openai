|Cycle start/end dates: auto populates dates|Make cycle start/end dates flexible including multiple months|
|Insert instructions: forces free typing in special instructions box|Provide drop down option @ end of usage cycle:
Recycle any
Return 1 box to contact on activity trac form; recycle balance
Other: please open a ticket for specialized instructions
|
|Special instructions: free typing field|Special Instructions: please open a ticket for programming or other specialized needs|



The team did ask, can the form be triggered to automatically open a ticket to the AC if special accommodations are needed & provide the ticket # to the client?





Background: These are the types of comments the special instruction box is used for:
 * Variable cycle start/end dates. Current option auto-populates dates.
 * Inserting instructions: @ end of usage cycle, ship 1 box to client; recycle balance.
 * Special Instructions: use x if you run out of Y; or anything else
 * Address or contact person to return if different from address at the top of the form







Can we make the following changes ..which would eliminate the need for the special instruction box:
 * Variable cycle start/end dates: Make cycle start/end dates flexible to any time range, including multiple months.
 * Inserting Instructions: Add drop down option to unused instruction to include: Return 1 box; recycle rest
 * Add pop up message to Unused instruction to say: Open a ticket to send details to your AC
 * Or remove the box leave a static note: Please open a ticket for any special instructions

HI, the PC team came up with 3 ideas as a way to replace the special instructions box on the activity trac form.

Do you think any are reasonable, and if so whats the best way to approach it with IS?

comment: Met with David and Christina,



She will be providing the following:



Hi Tyler, Thank you again for the time today to review the requests. This is the summary for the Ops team, and what I owe to you:


 * The cycle start and end dates: This affects more than just the activity trac form, and requires additional programming consideration. The request for consideration will be reviewed by the IS team.
 * We will leave the special instructions box for free typing as is; since we have no other way of addressing client requests for mid-month and additional months in the insert cycle selection process.




 * The insert instructions list of options: Please add 1 option to the existing drop down menu: Return 1 box; recycle balance. Ops request
