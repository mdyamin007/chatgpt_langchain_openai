We already started validation on stage and you can check the status on QA "https://app.smartsheet.com/sheets/2J7mMh6C8mjQ5CqJ9JmFp3gv87Rc7R2h4Wx3Vhx1"
I just invited you as well

We useca-preproc-sg-01 for stage. And it shows the correct output.
 [^mfcudl052.pdf]

Here we are using Wingdings & Webdings fonts. Font names prefixed with 'WD' and 'WG'


author: william.kong
comment: [~anwarh]: Can you please advise which WD and WG font you are using? I have a lot of these files and not sure which ones so that we can share with ISD.



I'm you are using the rasterized font instead of outline which I could create, but it's very late in the project to do so.
