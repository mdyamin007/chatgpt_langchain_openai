I think it is okay to have createAccount enabled on Development. However, that should not be enabled on the higher environment (Pilot, Stage, etc.)

I do see the GCBK front end code committed to trunk or any branch in estmt2. Can you double check and see if they are actually committed? If they are, please let me know the revision number. Also, please deploy GCBK front-end to Pilot.

[~tai.trinh] @isd,

code has been committed in */estmt2/gcbk/brances/dsi-responsive*, the revision number is *21029*.
currently we do not have permission to build prism client using jenkins, so we won't be able to deploy gcbk front end to pilot.
