title: APCU - [27785][pvt] InfoTrac Pilot Request
description: Upload requested documents for testing into Pilot site for specific member number.It will be for Electronic only



Here is the email request I was given regarding loading multiple documents to a single member number in pilot. Ive highlighted the important parts but essentially they're hoping to get these documents loaded into this member number 1033317

Daily Notice (any kind)
Tax Form (any kind)
First Mortgage Statement
Member Statement (x2 for the same month)


As discussed these documents do not need to belong to this member number or have real data if creating from scratch. Its more just so that we can test their process and ensure we can view them and that the doc descriptions are working.

We need to add a Second Mortgage Statement, the application, not an additional First Mortgage Statement.

comment: [~jharvey] I've removed the previous one and added a new Second Mortgage.
