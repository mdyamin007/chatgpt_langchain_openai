title: SEFC - Home Equity Fix
description: Internal notes:

Selective inserts was technically enabled for mortgage statement type in a different ticket but at the time it was only meant for ml5. This project is to enable selective inserts for ml3, that way we can enable the flag for mortgage selective inserts on the ISD side and keep it enabled permanently.

comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] Do we have ISD hours for this also? If so, can you add it?

comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] Please add 3 hours for this.
[~Shun.Kuwashima] Once you have the hours from Stephen, can you work on this? There's a parallel for this too. TS #34515.

Thanks.
