comment: [~Azad] I noted on a separate Jira ticket, but EWBB had previously approved the pilot site.

QA is in progress on the IS story. Please prepare your items in preparation for parallel testing, I'll be submitting this once QA is completed.

I will update each of the Jira ISD stories with this same update tied to this project. Thanks!

Process*_ml1_20211211_1_20211220_1104_ewbb.txt_* to test Mortgage. ml1 will be processed via Document processing.

Index file and zip file are already on place. Run the job with 'Parallel Run' checked to process on test mode.

For testing purpose, doc process will create account if new.

Thanks!

Code has been released for the Prism and PUI. One thing to keep in mind before posting mortgage is they need to set up an email template from the admin side for mortgage.



Thanks,
