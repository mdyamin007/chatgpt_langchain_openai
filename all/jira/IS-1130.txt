Following up with the client.

comment: [~jun] [~William.Kong]

Client responded to sample:

1. I reviewed the sample. One issue I see is that the statements are listing all of our promo and balance transfer tiers. We would need your programmers to add the logic - that if the APR rate is blank - then do not add that Promo / Balance Transfer tier.

2. I'm also seeing a mapping issues for the Promo Rate vs the Promo Rate 1. I will need to research that a bit more and may need to have your team tweak the logic.

3. We will need to put information on the statement about how long the Promo rate or Balance Transfer rate is good for. How can we do this w/o having the programmers update the code each time. How are your other CU clients addressing this?

I spoke to [~jun].

For Item #2, we need new mapping and mockup for

For item#3 we need mapping and mockup for new column or verbiage forhow long the Promo rate or Balance Transfer rate is good for.

Please provide those information to Jun for additional assessment and timeline.

For sure, we cannot go LIVE on tomorrow 06/14.

Client responded:

Regarding #2 - I researched this and do not see where they are getting the data for Promotion Rate. Promotion Rate 1 is correct.

Can you have your team run this latest data file to generate the statements - and add the logic -that if the APR rate is blank - then do not add that Promo / Balance Transfer tier.

Thanks

Client responded to sample:

Thanks Bill - but your team used the incorrect data file. Please have them use the last data file that I sent - calledDATA-FILE-VISA-05262022

The suppression logic worked correctly - but there is still an issue w/ two instances of the Promo Rate and Promo Rate 1. Can you have your team explain what field numbers they are pulling in for each of those?

I am using the attached files on this Jira ticket for the mapping, "OFCU_Mock_up_5.9.22.pdf", "Field Mapping.txt", "580 Credit Card Loan Information..txt", "582 Credit Card Loan Information_5.6.22.txt".

If it's incorrect, can customer provide what to use for Promo rate and Promo rate 1?

Please also attach the new test file.

comment: [~billr]: Please advise the clarification question Jun above on the field mapping. Live date is past due and we need to revisit a new live date.

The due has data has been pushed back. OFCU is waiting for new test corrected data file from JHA.
OFCU is confirming the mapping for the promo and Promo 1 fields from JHA. They also noticed that the expiration dates for the promotions are not found in the data file.  So this 

Thanks, Barnett

comment: Hi [~jun],

OSCU has updated the specs and requested new samples with the updated specs?
Per OSCU, 
* Promo rate 1 is pulled from record 580 field 28 and 30 - is for the regular promotion field. They stated that for Promo 1 to use the Promo 2 fields and Promo 3 uses the Promo 4 fields in the 580 record. 
* We also learned that we can only have one active promotion at a time - so at this point - we will only use 2 Special promotional rates. 
* Can you have your team update the promotional rates fields - and re-run the last statement data file that was sent?

Thanks, Barnett

comment: HI @jun,

Per OSCU,
For clarity for your team 
For the Promo 1 Rates  Use the Promo 2 fields in the 580 Record
For the Promo 2 Rates  Use the Promo 3 fields
We will only be using these two promo fields for now and for the scope of this project.

Thanks, Barnett

I've updated program to have only promo 1 and promo 2 rates. I think the latest test file only have promo 1 rate. Does customer want to send a test file that show each one?

I will check.

comment: Hi [~jun],

OFCU is checking with JHA to get clarification about the JHA. 

Thanks, Barnett 


author: barnetts
comment: Hi [~jun],

Please see OFCU response below on clarification from JHA. 
After having JHA look at our configuration - I have it dialed in now what we need to do. We won't be using Rate 1 and Rate 2 per se.  Instead it will be Rate 2, and Rate 3  - and these should map to the corresponding mappings in the 580 record. The same logic will apply for the balance transfers - and we will use 2 , and 3 with the corresponding mappings in the 582 record.

Attached I have a newly generate data file. We are focusing on the first account listed - 14575. Since we can only have one promo at a time - this file will be the Promo Purchase Rate 2 , and Promo Balance Rate 2. Once these look good - I will send a data file for the Promo Rate 3. Then next I'll send you the information in how to pull in the expiration dates for these promotions. 

Also can you have your team update the verbiage if there is info in the data file EXACTLY as follows if possible: 

Special Purchase Promotion2
Special Purchase Promotion3

Balance Transfer Promo Rate2
Balance Transfer Promo Rate3

comment: Hi [~jun],

OFCU wants additional changes. 
Please see their request below.
1. Change the verbiage from Special Promo Rate to Special Purchase Promo Rate.

2. The Average Balance for Special Purchase and Balance Transfers rates is incorrect. It should mirror the same logic that is being used to calculate the average balance for purchases (non- promotional). For example - if you look at the stmt 29184 - the avg balance for purchases is 1,168. This is correct. But look at the avg balance under the Special Rate 2 - which is showing 30,000. This should be 300.00. And the avg balance under Balance Transfer Rate 2 - is showing 200,000. They should be 2,000. I'm wondering if you have divide these values by 100

Thanks, Barnett

OFCU is wanting additional samples and changes. Please see below. 

Per OFCU,
Attached is a newer data file - called VISA-PROMO-EXP-DATES.txt  and contains data with the expiration dates for these promo. Please provide the samples for this data file. 

==============

Mapping Fields for Expired Promos. Use the logic that if if the field contains all zeros' then do not print the caption.

See ACCT# 67977
* Special Purchase Promo Rate2 Effective Until:    Field ID 650  - #50
* Special Purchase Promo Rate2 on Balances - Expires: #51
* Special Purchase Promo Rate2 Effective Until:  Field ID 650  - #52
* Special Purchase Promo Rate2 on Balances - Expires:                     #53
* Balance Transfer Promo Rate2  - Expires: Field ID 651 - #20
* Balance Transfer Promo Rate3  - Expires: Field ID 651 - #21
=================

Caption to add. 

* Special Purchase Promo Rate2  Effective Until:
* Special Purchase Promo Rate2 on Balances - Expires:
* Special Purchase Promo Rate3 -Effective Until:
* Special Purchase Promo Rate3 On Balances - Expires:

* Balance Transfer Promo Rate2  - Expires:
* Balance Transfer Promo Rate3  - Expires:

This section should be added after the last entry in the Interest charge calculation section. Only print the caption if there is a date listed in the in respective field. 

========================

I also included another data file called DATA-FILE-VISA-06272022-TEST B.txt. Please run samples w/ this - since this will have a mix of promotional rates and expiration dates.  [^DATA-FILE-VISA-06272022-TEST B..txt]  [^VISA-PROMO-EXP-DATES.txt]
