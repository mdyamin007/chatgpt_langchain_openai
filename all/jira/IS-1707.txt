title: BKPL Remove "Duplicate" Accounts from Aug EOM statements
description: BKPL Remove "Duplicate" Accounts from Aug EOM statements

We need to remove ALL statements that are "DUPLICATE" from Aug EOM eStatements. See attached example. These are authorized signor statements that should NOT have been sent out. JHA included in error.



We need some research done on the file from 0901(AIP706INFSTM20220901064534.XML.PGP I have moved this over) where there were missing check images where the following tags are set as follow. These are accounts that would have had an issue.

<Trunc>I</Trunc> and

<InclCr>N</InclCr> and

<CountAsEncl>Y</CountAsEncl>



Output the account number to the log and provide this list.



We will need to make an update when we see the verbiage Duplicate Statement which you already look for and SUPPRESS FROM ESTMT ONLY.
