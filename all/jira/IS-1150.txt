comment: Hi [~Bryanl],

I don't see anyone from IS assess TS#29406. And, I don't see engineer allocated in IS upcoming list. Please let me or [~Peter.Dang]or [~William.Kong] knows who give you timeline or you need new timeline for this.

Note: We cannot go live this month-end, if we need new timeline.



I requested [~kdishroon]to follow up in today scrum meeting too.

Thanks,

Tun
