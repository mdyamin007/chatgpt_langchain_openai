description: Update Visa programming if Record 500~ field 7~ = 62 and Record 580~ field 44~ exist, then display 'Promo Purchase' 0.00% on
the statement in the promo area under interest calculated buckets.



Work order attached along with the excel of accounts for pulling (highlighted).

We will need to have all 3 of the test archives we sent over ran through as that will show us the month by month changes for those buckets.

This project has not been approved yet. I've sent a reminder to the client and have made them aware this project could be pushed till after our code freeze. Their response from this morning is below:

Our side is still reviewing over all the samples so I will pass this along.

So far the only change that has come my way is the entire word "PROMO Purch" would like to be completed and say "PROMO Purchase"

comment: Hi [~Kbittmann],

Let's try to get their find feedback by EOD today. With this being the short week, please advise if we can the final approvals by Wednesday morning. That way we can squeeze this in Friday for QA and go live by Tuesday of next week.



Thanks!

I will pass that along to them. Please see their latest feedback below on samples:
Another question that has been asked is if there are a number of max rows that can be shown in the bottom area when the different buckets are displayed. We see 4 rows but wasn't sure if that is a max or could more be shown?

Example below.. the question is if for instance there is a 12BalTransPromo and this new Promo, would both be viewable or would they replace each other?

comment: Kris:

Yes, we can change the verbiage from 'PROMO Purc' to 'PROMO Purchase'.

No, 12BalTransPromo line will not be replace by the new Promo Puchase. 12BalTransPromo will display if record 582, field52 contains a value.

As for the number of rows, it can handle 5 and more.
