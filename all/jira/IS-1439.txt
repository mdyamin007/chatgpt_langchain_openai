The page # on the print samples don't match with the page #s request. I think OPS is printing from incorrect page range. Please use attached dpvs. The 2D prefix should be 'tlj'.

Not sure what is going on. Do you want to check the print afp instead? This is update just adding verbiage and it's same update/logic as previous months. We just had to keep rolling it back and updating each month.

Closing this Jira ticket since we don't need to rollback code. We can use the same selective message logic to update for TS 32800.
