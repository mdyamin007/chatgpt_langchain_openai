title: UCCU [20819] [pvt] - (RUSHED) Additional Statement Verbiage Request 0622
description: UCCU wants to add the following verbiage to the bottom of their statements for this upcoming month end.

It will be for this upcoming month end. This will be only this for this upcoming month end and no longer. 

This will be for selective account list statements.

This will be for their Print and eStmt

 

The verbiage is listed below:

 If you have experienced a loss of income related to the COVID-19 pandemic, Oregon law allows you to place your mortgage loan in forbearance until September 30, 2021, or later if the law is extended, and defer the missed payments until the end of the loan term. Forbearance is not automatic. You must notify us that you have a hardship to qualify for the forbearance. If you notified us before (the effective date of this 2021 Act), you must notify us again if your hardship has continued and you cannot make payments due on your mortgage loan. Contact us at 503-423-8713 for further information and to request a forbearance. If you have a federally backed mortgage loan, you might also be eligible for forbearance under the federal CARES Act. Please contact us for questions or to request either forbearance option.
