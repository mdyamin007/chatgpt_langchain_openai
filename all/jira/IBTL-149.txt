comment: Tien,

Can you check

comment: [~William.Kong]: /d/ctcu wasn't there. I created it. Please note not all folders are present. DP can reprocess now

comment: [~tient]: When I researched it, i did see /d/ctcu. But i think the real issue was cfcu based on log above and the title was misleading.

Thanks for creating the folder.  I need to research why I did not include cfcu in my menlo to brisbane sync originally.



[~alexw]: I believe this is related to CFCU instead of CTCU. I'm going to fix the title.
