comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima]-Has the index file come through from DSI on this? Thanks

comment: [~Ricky Lopez] Normally IS/DSI would provide the index filename on the ISD story when it is ready. I don't see it on either of our stories so they might still be working on it.

[~mousumiS] [~Hamimul.Chowdhuri] Let me know when an index file is ready to post onto pilot. Also if you could let me know the index file prefix in advance, then I can add that to our configurations ahead of time. Thanks

Thanks!

comment: [~anwarh] After some testing I was able to post the index file using the newer doc processing, however I noticed none of their existing apps are using the newer process. Is this expected? Just wanted to confirm since ISD has to setup additional configurations. 

[~Ricky Lopez] File is posted onto pilot, please have the client review. Below are some accounts they can check:

528319044
528319053

comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid], this is setting up a new Account Analysis tab on the admin site and SSO as well as a new email template. Please verify the tab/statement link shows and emails can be triggered. Here are a few accounts you can use for testing: 528319044, 528319026, 528319053.

Instructions:
*Admin site*
1. Login to stage admin site and search for the above accounts. There should be an Account Analysis tab and statement to view. Please use accounts from Ref#197958 on Stage PUI to verify estatement output.

*SSO*
1. Using the SSO test page, click stage and fill in the CIF Number and Account fields by pair, see below:
CIF Number     Account
541707110	528319026
553794616	528319044
440157227	528319053
2. You should land on the enrollment steps. Please complete it, should be straightforward.
3. Once landing on the home page, there should be an Account Analysis tab.

*Emails* (This must be performed after completing the SSO portion)
1. Go to PUI Stage, click on Email Notification at the top and search for KYCU.
2. Look for Job Ref ID 197451, it should be at the top. 
3. Click on it and you should see a short sample email content for Account Analysis. Click Submit.to trigger the email job.
4. The email job should run successfully and you should receive a test email from stage shortly after. You should receive one email per CIF/Account pair that you tested prior.

Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks

comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima]Is estatement in InfoTrac?


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~Ricky Lopez] KYCU still uses the prism admin site, statements can be viewed there when available.

[~anwarh] [~mousumiS] [~Hamimul.Chowdhuri] Please advise on what index file we should use for stage verification. QA would need to validate this as well.




author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~Ricky Lopez] [~mousumiS] Confirmed, index file ms2_20220831_1_20221020_0445_kycu.txt is posted onto stage and I can view statements on stage.

[~Igor.Khosid] This was posted on 10/20 on stage PUI Ref#197958, I believe you can use the accounts from this job to verify estatement output on stage.

comment: [~Igor.Khosid] [~avannik] Is this still being tested? 


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~avannik] Thanks for updating the status.

comment: [~Ricky Lopez] I saw your production TO meeting invite for 11/4, can I release code for this tomorrow eod? I'm going to be OOO on thursday and ideally we don't want to release code on fridays. It won't really change anything on the sites until we post the first analysis file anyway, plus code release is necessary so that the client can update the account analysis email template.

Also, should we set up automatic emails for this new app or keep it manual?


author: JIRAUSER11400
comment: Hi [~Shun.Kuwashima]-I am ok with releasing as long as [~phoebe.george]does not have concern.

This will be manual


author: JIRAUSER11400
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima]We are good to release


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~Ricky Lopez] Thanks, I still plan to release eod. Will update here again at that time.


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~Ricky Lopez] Code released to production. Client should now be able to update the Account Analysis email template, please have them do so before the first cycle posts.
