title: MFCU [27665] [pvt] Credit Card Statement Changes - Formatting Fix, BT Interest and Promos RUSH for 4/15 LIVE
description: *Must be live for the 4/18 production cycle.*
 # # Formatting issue with Minimum Payment Warning  looks like they are running out of space and as a result the balances is bleeding below the line. This is happening for people who have higher balances.
 # Adding BTs to Interest Charge section even if zero  we added BTs even if $0.00 in the summary but we missed to add it in the Interest Charge section as well. This will add BTs to that section even if $0.00.
 # Better description for balance transfers  we feel the promo descriptions arent very intuitive to the member. I think the old descriptions were Promo Rate #.
 For #3 we would like to change the descriptions to: Balance Transfer Promo or Cash Advance Promo or Purchase Promo. Basically remove the word "Rate" from those lines.

#1 needs to be fixed by next cycles because it is a formatting issue. #2 also needs to be done by next cycle. If the 3rd will delay this, then please prioritize #1 and #2.

Per Peter, parallel is not required.

comment: [~Andrey.Kutsenko]for estmt posting, the same job cycle was processed on 3/24 already that is why it failed posting. I undo the old posting and repost the new one. it is done posting successfully now. Is there an issue with job status (infotrac) too or just the estmt posting?


author: JIRAUSER11104
comment: [~rukmaniR] [~yameelee],It's OK now. Thanks!

QA - passed.

author: JIRAUSER11100
comment: [~andreav] This pdf has few of the affected accounts and you can send it as sample. There are 36 .zip.pgp files. If you want me to place them in client pickup please let me know.

Thanks!


author: andreav
comment: Sample has been provided to client via TS27655 for approval by 4/6.

comment: [~rukmaniR]Client wants to see samples on InfoTRAC Job Status. Please run eStatements and let me know when done.

Thanks!


author: andreav
comment: I don't see cycle 24 posted on InfoTRAC. Diego said when you run eStatements, it automatically posts to job tracking because there is AOLP but I don't see it. Please check and advise.

author: andreav
comment: Should I be looking at one of the cycles already posted? I only see cycle 3/18 and once from 10/18.


author: andreav
comment: This should not hold up QA and go live. Client still provided approval and needs us to make the 4/15 live date.
[~Igor.Khosid]  Please advise status of QA.


author: andreav
comment: To respond on the - and + symbol inconsistency that Andrey reported. Diego said the reason why they are different is because in the summary of account they don't come in the data with the "-" signs but in the transactions they do
we hard code them on the summary of account.
Therefore, no change is required, client already approved as is. 
[~Andrey.Kutsenko] - Please move forward with QA and confirm when passed.
[~rukmaniR] - Please run eStatements on pilot so client can see the job in InfoTRAC job status.


author: JIRAUSER11100
comment: [~andreav] It is posted on pilot. I'm able to see  it in job status. Can you please check?

Thanks!
