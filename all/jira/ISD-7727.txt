Should the new disclosure pdf links be added to the sidebar? I marked the link with red color. Let me know if it's okay.

comment: [~mamunur.rashid] The placement of the links are good, but can you update the names to the following from customer below. This is what they emailed below. I'll update the description as well.



_The placement is fine but can we make sure the naming is updated to this:_

Deposit Statement  Reverse side

Equity Statement  Reverse side

Loan Statement  Reverse side
