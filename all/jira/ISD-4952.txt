comment: Setting up Hypercube, PUI, InfoTRAC should covers all of this.

This is just an official ticket created from client-facing team specifically for being able to post the statement, and view the statements on the two sites.

And emails

Nvm, we should set up eStatement anyway for archival in case when we do go live with eStatement for Promontory.

Client facing will most likely create a new ticket when we need to do more work on this.
