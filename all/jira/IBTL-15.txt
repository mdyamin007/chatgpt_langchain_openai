title: ca-preproc-pr-02: Unit Testing - Preprocessing Data Scripts [Python]

*Summary:*

There are some scripts running on either RHS, RH2 that ssh into preprocessing02 to run python scripts on Preprocessing02 because RHS or RH2 cannot run the python programs.



+*Objectives:*+
 # Identify all CIDs that invokes preprocessing02 to run any python programs (e.g.: OSCU monthly statement). Please document these the CID & applications & script name; We will need this list during and after the brisbane move project. Here's a command to help you get started.
{noformat}
grep -irH 'preprocessing02' /home/master/* | grep ssh | grep 'py'{noformat}

 # Test each python script+manually+ in Parallel environment. Copy the input data file from the existing Menlo Park servers and run it manually. Make sure you run md5sum at the end of testing to ensure output results matches the output results in Menlo.

*NOTE*: I did not create the CIDs in /z/ftpu /z/download/ /z/CID/ /z/daily/ /z/prep/CID /z/pdf_afp
