description: * In the Summary of Account Activity make two changes:

1. Include Balance Transfers on the list of items. Put right underneath Cash Advances.

* In the Interest Charge Calculations for the rates under Annual Percentage Rate (APR) the rates only need to go to the hundredth position. So it would go from 9.900% to 9.90% Credit Card Statment Changes.docx Annual Billing Rights Notice 03 2020.docx

* Add inline insert:
Attached is the approved disclosure. I also confirmed we want these to go in eStatements and archive.

If a statement had a page 1 and a page 2 then print as a page 3 on the second sheet of paper

If a statement had a page 1 a page 2 and full or partial page 3, then print on page 4 the back of the second sheet of paper.
