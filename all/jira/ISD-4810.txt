title: APCU [20706] [pvt] - Track First Mortgage ePosting Error [in house]
description: Per Shun: I actually just finished posting the 5 statements successfully, but for dates I think 6/18 would be fine. I just wanted to have a jira ticket for the sake of tracking purposes, so I went ahead and took care of this first.

comment: See if you need to do anything. If not, okay to close out with "Not Doing" Resolution and comment here that no aciton need to be taken by ISD.
