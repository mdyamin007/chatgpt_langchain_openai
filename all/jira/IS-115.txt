title: UCCU [19754] [pvt] UCCU - Daily Notice - Adverse Action and Credit Score Disclosure (Verbiage Update)
description: UCCU has attached the word documents of the changes. The change is highlighted in yellow on the letters. 

They have attached the test file with the Credit Report Name appended to the end of each record.   

 

UCCU wants the program  to insert the Credit Report Contact Information into the Adverse Action Letters as follows:

Equifax - EQUIFAX, P.O. Box 740241, Atlanta, GA 30374-0241, 1-800-685-1111, www.equifax.com

 

TransUnion - TRANSUNION Consumer Relations, 2 Baldwin Place P.O. Box 1000, Chester, PA 19016, 1-800-888-4213, www.transunion.com/credit-reports-disclosures/free-credit-report

 

The Credit Score Disclosure letters just need to have the name of the credit report mapped, ie. "EQUIFAX" or "TRANSUNION"

    01 - Adverse Action (Denial) Equity
    02 - Adverse Action ( Counter) Equity
    03 - Adverse Action (Denial)
    04 -Adverse Action (Counter)
    05 - Home Loan Credit Score Disclosure
    06 - Consumer Credit Score Disclosure
    07 - Credit Score Disclosure (Not Available)
    08 - Adverse Action (Denial) Indirect
    09 - Adverse Action (Counter) Indirect
