comment: Pending resources from DSI

comment: Hi [~Shun.Kuwashima], I think resource change is already done by the Monthly application. 
 But can you please ensure if `*_PFCUSSWR.TIF_*` exists or not? If it does, nothing needs to be changed.

Thanks

comment: [~anwarh] Resource PFCUSSWR.TIF exists already on all our servers.


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: Since resource already exists on our servers, no further updates required from ISD. Closing ticket.
