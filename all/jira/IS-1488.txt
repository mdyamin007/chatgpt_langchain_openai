comment: Hi [~anwarh]

Per client:

The business unit has reviewed the samples and unfortunately they gave us the wrong letter to use. The one they want us to use is basically the same however has 3 additional items they need added on the top righthand side. They are listed in the red box below (MFCU30485.png). Can you guys please add these items and send me new proofs?Apologies for the inconvenience.

author: anwarh
comment: Hi [~dyuen], 

Archival sample is in: ac-secure-share/dsi_print/anwarH/mfcudla_is_1488

Note that the data structure doesn't match with the rest of the onbase ServDir4 letters.
Please ask the client to check the index file and provide appropriate mapping for these
Index Layout:
MemberNumber|FirstName|LastName|BlankByDesign|BlankByDesign|NoticeName|DocumentDate|
Pdf File Name

[~dyuen], refer SOW, also please update it accordingly.

author: anwarh
comment: Hi [~kdishroon], [~dyuen], 

Is the archival approved yet? 

I asked this in my last comment, 
https://jira.infoimageinc.com/browse/IS-1488?focusedCommentId=51903&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-51903
Any response for this?

Thanks,
Anwar


author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~anwarh], MFCU asked the following:

Can you give me an example of how one of the index files names are formatted? Keith needs to see one to confirm what he needs to set up for OnBase.

I know the format is supposed to be:MemberNumber|FirstName|LastName|BlankByDesign|BlankByDesign|NoticeName|DocumentDate|Pdf File Name

I'd like to see what it looks like with the data filled in. Let me know if this makes sense.

---------------------------------------------------

Can you confirm?

Thanks

[~kdishroon]


author: anwarh
comment: [~dyuen], Not sure what they are asking, but if they wanted an example of past setup, here is one

One of the letter of 'OnBase ServDir4' is 145
 Data file:
{code:none}
NoticeType|DecisionDate|ApplicationId|ApplicationDate|ApplicantID|ApplicantFirst|ApplicantLast|ApplicantFull|JointFirst|JointLast|JointFull|Address1|Address2|City|State|Zip|ReqLoanAmt|Dealer|ApplicantScore|CreditReportDate|ApplicantRangeLow|ApplicantRangeHigh|Comment1|Comment2|Comment3|Comment4|Factor1|Factor2|Factor3|Factor4|Factor5
P|2022-06-25|215791|2022-06-25|273273|Brenda|Perez|Brenda S Perez||||1425 Second st Spc 302||Chula Vista|CA|91911|27100.00|Toyota Carlsbad|618|2022-06-25|250|900|Unsatisfactory history with MFCU||||SERIOUS DELINQUENCY AND PUBLIC RECORD OR COLLECTION FILED|TOO MANY ACCOUNTS WITH BALANCES|PROPORTION OF LOAN BALANCES TO LOAN AMOUNTS IS TOO HIGH|LENGTH OF TIME REVOLVING ACCOUNTS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED|
{code}
And from that we create an index file like this:
{code:none}
<column 3>|<column 6>|<column 7>|||NOTICE - Indirect Adverse Action Letter|<processing date>|\\onbasefile\onbasefiles\XDI Bulk Notices\<pdf file name>
{code}
So for this letter, I need to know the mapping of these values, except the processing date and pdf file name.
 Thanks

Here is the indexing update that was approved here.

comment: Hi [~dyuen], 

I've put new archival sample in :

Thanks,

author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~anwarh], please see below from MFCU:

Hello. Carlo advised me that these notices should use the Standard indexing set up not SERVDIR4, since the data for these notices/letters come out of Symitar.

Can you confirm if this it correct? If so, this is what the indexing should look like below. Do you need to generate new archive files?



*Zip File name*=MFCU_dl_Standard_archival_<mmddyy>_<seg#>_<seq#>.Zip.pgp*_Index Filename:_*___MFCU_dl_Standard_archival_mmddyyyy_seg#.idx_

*Index Layout*:

MemberNumber|FirstName|LastName|BlankByDesign|BlankByDesign|NoticeName|DocumentDate|

Pdf File Name

*Example*:

9999999999|MARY|MEMBER|||NOTICE  W8-BEN|MM/DD/YYYY|\\onbasefile\onbasefiles\XDI Bulk Notices\2021102^W8-BEN_Expiring^1^199720.PDF

*PDF Name:*DocumentDate^mfcu_ExpiringW8BENyyyymmdd^<seq#>^LoanNumber.PDF



Do we need to generate new archive files? If not, can we start parallel please?

Thanks


author: dyuen
comment: Per MFCU:



so we tried to import the file you sent last week and it failed. Here is what Keith reported:

This is what we got:

9999999999|MARY MEMBER||||NOTICE  Expiring W8BEN|MM/DD/YYYY|\\onbasefile\onbasefiles\XDI Bulk Notices\2021102^W8-BEN_Expiring^1^199720.PDF



Should be:

9999999999|{color:#ff0000}MARY MEMBER{color}*||||*{color:#ff0000}NOTICE {color}*Expiring W8BEN*|MM/DD/YYYY|\\onbasefile\onbasefiles\XDI Bulk Notices\2021102^W8-BEN_Expiring^1^199720.PDF


 # Additional Pipe
 # Needs a Dash like this: Expiring W8{color:#ff0000}*-*{color}BEN


author: anwarh
comment: Hi[~dyuen],

New sample is in:/d/ac-secure-share/dsi_print/anwarH/mfcudla_is_1488/
*Note: *I can not add another pipe, it's a global setup for all 'Onbase Standard' letters.

Thanks


author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~anwarh], it looks like they meant to have the extra pipeline added between the First and last name. See response from MFCU:

*There is still an issue with the archive file from yesterday. There should be a pipe in between the member first and last name and there is not. Here is the correct format;*

*Example*:

9999999999|MARY|MEMBER|||NOTICE  W8-BEN|MM/DD/YYYY|\\onbasefile\onbasefiles\XDI Bulk Notices\2021102^W8-BEN_Expiring^1^199720.PDF

*Also, the account number is being added and it should not be. Here is what it looks like now when it came over to us. Because of that the archive is failing on our end.*



*I'm expecting once these are fixed we should be good.*


author: anwarh
comment: Hi [~dyuen], 

There is no separate field for First and Last names. The only way to do this is to split the name. 
/d/ac-secure-share/dsi_print/anwarH/mfcudla_is_1488
Here is a sample. 
If that doesn't work, it had to be in a single field. 

Thanks


author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~anwarh], per our Zoom conversation. Please release code for the print part and keep the archival code on hold. MFCU would like to get this mailed ASAP.

The print samples were approved, but we haven't done parallel yet. Can you provide a test dpvs, checklist etc for parallel?

Thanks

[~berezinez], FYI


author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~anwarh], more feedback on the archival. Can you review and advise?

Thanks



Daphne, here is the file we sent you and used for testing the W8-BEN letters

!image-2022-11-04-12-08-24-302.png!



Here is a file that we sent you this week for another letter (production). The format is the same as the W8-BEN above. Those letters are coming back to us using the same indexing that we want to use for the W8-BEN. The name is not parsed out and is all in one field. What is different about these letters than our w8-BENs?

If you think we should get on a call today or Monday, that would be fine!!

author: anwarh
comment: Hi [~dyuen], 

Yes, both of the data file formats are the same. But this one (letter 081) has first and last names in the data like this
{code:none}
nameFirst=NICHOLAS
nameLast=BONILLA
{code}
Please ask them If they can add similar fields in this letter's data file too. 

Thanks

comment: Thanks [~anwarh].

I also created MPT #35701 in the meantime.

parallel ID: 20221102164042
Project exported to QA folder. 

Thanks. 


author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~anwarh],

Please see below questions from MFCU regarding the archival for this update:

"Daphne, I see what you are saying. For the other files there are additional fields added at the bottom of each member record that lists the first and last name as separate fields.

If we can add this to the W8BEN file, would that resolve this issue?

Other than this are there still issues with the pipe delimiters?

Are these the only two issues remaining?

We received another W8Ben archiver file this morning. The first and last name was separated. Did you guys send over a new one this morning?"

-------

As far as I know, we didn't send a new archive file. Can you confirm>

Thanks

QA is still in progress, please don't assign TS ticket.

QA is completed for the paper side. IS checklist is attached.

[^IS_1488_MFCU_IS_checklist.pdf]


author: anwarh
comment: [~dyuen], Not sure which file they are talking about, 
I did generate another sample that I mentioned in this comment: 
https://jira.infoimageinc.com/browse/IS-1488?focusedCommentId=56852&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-56852
Which had names separated but done by the program.

comment: Adding notes from 11/8 meeting with Vivian at MFCU:

Here is a recap/some notes from our meeting this morning:
 * Mission Fed team will add 2 new fields for member First and Last name at the bottom of the data file for archival purposes
 * We will only use 3 pipes between last name and notice name ---> symi acct #, first, last name,|||, Notice Name
 * Small dash preferable for the Notice name "Notice - Expiring W8-BEN"; Vivian to check on this with Keith
 * Below is a screenshot of the expected format to return back to MFCU:
!https://app.na3.teamsupport.com/dc/1888578/images/f813d61a-06a7-48d5-8fa6-b154876063aa.png!

---------------------

Once MFCU sends a new test file for archival, it will be provided to Anwar to generate a new sample.


author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~anwarh], please see the follow-up answers to the questions from yesterday's meeting:

Per MFCU:

"Here is the update to the questions we had from our call today:

1- Is it ok to have the account number at the end of the PDF name?

Yes, that is fine. We have other notices that have that.

2- Does it matter if there are small or large dashes used in the indexing?

No, either can be used."


author: dyuen
comment: HI [~anwarh], they sent a new file. Please use this one for the archival part.

Thanks


author: dyuen
comment: [~anwarh], please advise when samples will be ready. Also MFCU wanted to know if Bad Address accounts would be included in their archive file.

Thanks


author: anwarh
comment: Hi [~dyuen], Archival includes all accounts. I will provide a sample today. Thanks


author: anwarh
comment: Hi [~dyuen],

The data file you mentioned above is not XDI format data.
And the latest data file productionwhich has this latter mfcu_dl_11152022_3.zip, doesn't have first and last names in it either. 

Please ask for an updated data file that holds that info based on our last meeting so that I can generate a sample. 

Thanks
