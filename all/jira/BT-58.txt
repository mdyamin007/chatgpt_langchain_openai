comment: [~Andrey.Kutsenko]Since this index file along with the others mentioned in ISD 7366 are manually created by us, it needs some configuration changes on conf files of their corresponding cids on stage server to process those files properly. Should I make these changes for you ? Changes need to be reverted after testing completes.
