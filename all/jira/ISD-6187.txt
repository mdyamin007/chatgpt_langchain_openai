comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] This seems like at most adding a new index file prefix for the mortgage app from the ISD side. If that sounds correct, then I don't think I need to do anything until we receive a mortgage index file from IS to post onto pilot.

comment: Hi [~Shun.Kuwashima]- Please note, there are several different versions so we'll need you to upload them when the samples are ready. There are 4 versions.

1. Regular - sample ready 2/18

2. Delinquency - Still needs to be turned over

3. Bankruptcy - turned over. Waiting for sample date

4. Re-instated - turned over. Waiting for sample date


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] Sure thing, I'll keep an eye out for these.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima]- FYI all mortgage samples will be ready on 3/3.


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] Is there a new live date? If not, can we at least update it to a tentative date? 


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima]-Please see attached updated x-ref file. Please note, x-ref file will be sent daily for ALL applications to the "xref" subfolder on SEFC FTP. File name =sefc_xRef_ccyymmdd_seg#.csv.pgp and will arrive by 5:30am PST.

comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] Are you referring to the bknt folder? I don't see an xref folder in the /bknt/sefc folder nor in the SEFC FTP and I only see an xref subfolder under the bknt folder on Secure4, so just wanted to confirm before I add it to the file scheduler.

In other words, should the location be secure4 /bknt/xref or /bknt/sefc/xref or something else? Thanks


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima]- Network created xref subfolder underBKNT/SEFC. You do not see it?


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] I do not, attaching screenshot bknt_sefc_ftp.PNG. I've also attached another screenshot bknt_ftp.PNG which shows the subfolders in the bknt folder.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: Hey [~Shun.Kuwashima]- apologies, but can you check in the SEFC ftp? I forgot that this file will come directly from the CU not BKNT.


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com], I checked both SEFC in secure3 and sefc in secure4 and still don't see any xref subfolder. Attached screenshots of both.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: Hey [~Shun.Kuwashima]- Per Kent -As far as I know from the scanner, the folder in ftpbu will be created when the scanner pulls a file from the actual ftp server. It will not be there until there is a file to move.We do not manually create them in ftpbu.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima]- Per Prem - Please check now: manually scan over the sref folder to the SECUBU. (secu is on secure3)


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] Thanks, I see the xref subfolder in the secure3 SEFC folder. I've created the file schedule. Do they want missing/late file emails to send out for this? If so, what days should we be expecting the file by 5:30am PST (i.e. daily, every m-f, 1st, 2nd, etc)?


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima]- Yes, please enable missing/late files. Same email as before. Expect file each day by 5:30am PST


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] thanks, also let me know when we should expect the first file to get dropped off in that xref folder and I can enable the missing/late emails then.

Note: Also removing screenshots I provided earlier since the xref folder exists in the correct location now.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima]- FYI - DSI will have index and files for posting on Thursday of next week 6/23. Please be prepared to post right away as we need to get their final approval by 6/24. Thanks
