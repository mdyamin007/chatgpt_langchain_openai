Reverting status to "In Progress" as this is implementation project

comment: [~Sheikh_Fahim]- There's an issue with both samples. It looks like it's printing twice. Please see below screenshot.

Actually the data file i used had these lines multiple times and it got printed so that won't be an issue when new data file will be used . A screenshot of the data file that i have used is attached below:

Thanks

comment: [~Sheikh_Fahim]- So the verbiage printing twice will be in the production file. It's how Jack Henry displays *BOLD* print in their print image files.



Can you remove the repeated lines and *BOLD* them?


author: rony
comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]

So can we go like this logic,

if any line is exactly match with previous line we will display one once and bold the line.

comment: [~rony]- Per OPS -the tray designation is wrong. Tray1 is actually bottom perf(4005) and there is a Tray2 which is 4000. Please update.

comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]

Is there any matter regarding Coupon or Perf in these new two letters?For now we are using Stroke code 4000 for both of the letters. Is it correct?



[~Andrey.Kutsenko]



Thanks


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~Sheikh_Fahim]- Yes, that is correct.

[~Andrey.Kutsenko]- Will this QA be done today? Please advise. First data file arrives on Monday.


author: rony
comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]

So in your comment https://jira.infoimageinc.com/browse/IS-1429?focusedCommentId=46620&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-46620we are not sure what is wrong in print sample. Would you please explain more?



[~Sheikh_Fahim]

Thanks


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~rony]- I may have been mistaken. Can you please confirm that the program has 4005 assigned to Tray 1 and 4000 to Tray 2? If you can confirm, we should be all good.

[~Andrey.Kutsenko]- FYI


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~Andrey.Kutsenko]- Hi! So the paper tray is my mistake. In my print request, I had put down tray 1 = 4000. That is wrong. It should be tray 1 = 4005 and tray 2 = 4000. I confirmed with DSI that this setting is present in the current logic so we should be good to go.

New print samples >>>  [^IS-1429_BKPL_PrntSmpls_08192022.pdf] 
I don't see on the print samples that you used the new paper tray.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~Andrey.Kutsenko]-Yes, that is all correct. These 2 letters are part of the LN Notices. There are some notices that get a 4005 paper. However, these 2 letters only are printed on 4000. So while the tray assignments are Tray 1 = 4005 and Tray 2 = 4000, these particular letters get printed on 4000 only. Make sense?
