Update GCBKMS11.dfa on the 3 light_gray headers from 25% to 50% to test print if it's good (after EOM so 8/8 to request for print would be ideal). If not dark enough, increase a bit more for more testing before requesting for QA.

comment: [~Tevis Mak] [~Igor.Khosid],

I spoke with Igor and there isn't much he can do/QA. Given the circumstances of this request, I've requested print samples first to have OPS review before we send to GCBK to review.

Thanks!

comment: Adding Ron Davis' email for reference.

"Hi Daphne, please refer to the sample attachment,



Image 5 is grayscale on front side (simplex) - good

Image 14 is grayscale on back side (duplex)  prints lighter



I reached out to the programmer (Tevis) and he confirmed all gray scale headers front and back were updated from 25% to 50%, so I will have Canon on site Monday morning to address the printer values.



Updates to follow Monday

[~Tevis Mak], per attached email, we will not be proceeding with the shading updates. The original setting will be kept.

Please cancel Jira.

Thanks!
