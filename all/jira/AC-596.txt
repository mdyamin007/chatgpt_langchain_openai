Per RWCU:

We need to work on getting these notices returned with XML Archival files.

I show that the two files included in these notices are:
 * RWCUILSCOLLECTMMDD.txt
 * RWCUILSMMDD.txt

 * RWCUILSCOLLECTMMDD.txt already includes the full account number in the data file. The account number is the 10 characters of the 75th (4th from last) field. The leading zeros will need to be removed when added to the XML file are returned to us.
 * RWCUILSMMDD.txt requires an update on our end
