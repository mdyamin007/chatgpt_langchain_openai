comment: [~gthillaivel] BKPL only has paper jobs enabled for job status, so the estatement posting is expected not to show.

[~rumanb] can you check why there would be no records for the paper job?

Would it be possible to advise here? We are not sure why enotice is not appearing in jobs status. estmt trac is on in our control file bkpldnb.control.

comment: [~rony] BKPL only has print online proofing, they don't have estatement online proofing enabled. I don't see it enabled on production either. 
[~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] is there a reason why estatement online proofing is not enabled?


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: Hi [~Shun.Kuwashima]- It looks like it is enabled on production (see attached). Doesn't look to be on pilot. I've requested PC to do so.

Can you please help on this issue-TIA


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] can you confirm with PC if they enabled estatement flags? If they already did, then it might be similar/related to the stage issue we experienced on IS-1285 which I believe Peter was looking into. Not sure if there is any update on that, but we may need to proceed without job status and use account management to verify in the meantime if this needs to be released soon.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: Hey [~Shun.Kuwashima]. Yes, let's very via Account Management. Can you please give me some accounts to lookup?



[~gthillaivel]- FYI.


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] I found 3 different letter codes in the index file, provided one account for each:
104 - 170009472400
106 - 1420223503
109 - 240045963


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima]- I'm not seeing any letters on the Account Management tab for these 3 accounts. Please advise. Do we need to wait for Peter to get back to us regarding the issue for IS-1285?

Would you please check again in stage infotrac job status dt job id133778-C08.01-V22592. Looks like it's working.

Would you please post the index filednb_20220510_2_20220829_1010_bkpl.txt to stage and check if this is coming in the account management tab? [~gthillaivel]is not seeing any sample with searching by account no in account management tab .



Hi [~anil.dasa]Would it be possible to suggest here where to look at about this: "There should be 2 rows in the job status .One for paper and second for estmt.Currently only one record is displayed." from previous comment from [~gthillaivel]

process id:709890 cid: bkpl.

comment: [~gthillaivel] I took down a few older postings and was able to post the latest index file dnb_20220510_2_20220829_1010_bkpl.txt successfully on stage.

Also, are you expecting a letter description called 'Collection Letter' for a specific letter code? Currently none of the letter codes have such description and I'm not aware of any updates to that.

comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] I believe PC needs to enable some estatement related flags so that the all/paper/estatement tabs show on job status. Can you check with PC on this?

comment: Hi [~rumanb] [~gthillaivel] [~Shun.Kuwashima]- PC enabled eStatements on Stage. I'm seeing the Job Status screen got updated but the eStatements still aren't showing even though there's a line item for them. Do we need to reprocess?


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~rumanb] infotrac is showing dtjobid 133925-C01.01-V22592 however the enotice index file posted yesterday dnb_20220510_2_20220829_1010_bkpl.txt has a dtjobid 133778-C08.01-V22592, so they do not match. Can you advise on whether we need to reprocess a new index file?

Posted index file, and able see the notices for now. Even though the status description shows as "estmt is currently running", this is not a blocker for this release. I am able to view the posted notice in the Account management. Closing this issue for now
