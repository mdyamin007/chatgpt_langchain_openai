comment: Hi [~dyuen],

Is this letter set up for print only? The title and description says to add enotice, but this application doesn't post to enotice and the test file doesn't have account number. Ticket 19780 also say print only. There might just be a typo in the title and description. I just wanted to double check before updating.

comment: Hi [~jun], it looks like the Jira was set incorrectly. This notice should only have print. No electronic.
