For sample request I need image number instead of print pages. I will update the request to have a larger print range to counter this.

Thanks, Barnett

The samples are approved by UTCU.

Thanks, Barnett

comment: [~barnetts] [~Igor.Khosid] 
Since the request for samples has already been made with an additional range, I wanted to note that this application has more than one letter and was tested with other letters that this application receives. The range was provided from the afp and was to print only the letter that was being updated, so when print samples are available, please note that the print sample may contain other letters, but the updates were only made for letter 5.
