title: SURU PDF Archival to the S3 Cloud Fix
description: SURU PDF Archival to the S3 Cloud Fix

Update the documentation composition tool to detect if document has duplicate IID. If that is the case, our program will only generate the first occurrence of the duplicate IID. The duplicate IID will be ignored and skipped. We will also create a report and email a list of all the duplicate IID that is detected.

The email content will be setup as follows:

SUBJECT: SURUMS5: Duplicate IID detected in your PDF Archival Files.

BODY:

Dear Valued Customer,

SURU_Military_stmt_iid_duplicate_021422_1.txt report for SURU_Military_Electricity_Inv_021422_072814.txt is attached for you to review. It contains IID that appears multiple times in the cycle but only one PDF was created in your PDF archival files. The report contains the total occurrences and the IID value.

archival samples are in :

/z/pdf_afp/suru/surums3/zip/
/z/pdf_afp/suru/surums4/zip/
/z/pdf_afp/suru/surums5/zip/
/z/pdf_afp/suru/surums6/zip/
/z/pdf_afp/suru/surums7/zip/



Those are the ones for which archival was having issues. And the issue is :

archival pdf name is currently <IID>.pdf but it happens that same iid can appear multiple times hence pdf got generated with the same name and replaced each other. Previously from dfa part in the archival afp we were generating statements for all iid but when it comes to converting to pdf it was causing issues because of same iid. With one update from dfa part we will generate one statement for one iid , if same iid found later dfa will not generate statement for that iid. So while it comes to converting to pdf only one pdf will be created for each iid , hence no placing will not happen.

comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]: Can you confirm if we can release this job early (i.e today 3/10) instead of the live date of 3/11 since QA complete so that we can finally address the client external duplicate IID issue.



Also, [~rony]also wants to release the other invaild address Jira tickets as well for SURU projects as well.
