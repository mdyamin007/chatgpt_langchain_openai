title: ca-input-dv-01 (ISD Dev File Server) Request
description: [~kent.chan]: Kent, would it be possible to create an ISD dev input server so that my rhs servers can mount via NFS. We create eStatement afp & index files on this server. At least create the OS first and then by the time next week you guys can attach to Isilon Server.



For now, I'm putting this ticket in the "Backlog" status. If you agree, i will promote this to "Selected for Development" status.



[~davidt]: FYI

comment: what's the point of creating a dev box so your prod machine can write to it? is it the license issue where your prod system is also your dev system?


author: william.kong
comment: [~kent.chan]: Short answer is "Yes". It's related to the license issue. Our Production/Stage Papyrus Server writes Staging files to isd_input_dev.

comment: [~kent.chan]: Who is working on this Jira ticket? I noticed the Brisbane Server list row 433 was updated with IP address of10.5.16.149 but i think it is still WIP since I cannot ping this IP address. Please advise so that I can update the Assignee list and move it into the "In Progress" Column.

[~davidt]: I just installed the nfs server:

sudo apt-get install -y autofs cifs-utils nfs-common samba-client samba-common



Would your team be able to configure it? Please email me if you can. If not, i will find time to work on it tomorrow and worry only the directories I need. I will close this ticket for now. 





Thanks!
