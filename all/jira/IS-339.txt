comment: Hi [~yameelee]- The bank is updating the PDF to include colors and graphics. The attached is the preliminary version. The bank may add their logo to subsequent pages on the top left. That will be determined and be ready by next week.

We will need to...

1. Print in color

2. 3 hole punch at the top

3. Insert into Custom heavies envelope

Please review test file and let me know of any preliminary questions you have.

comment: This data is totally different from the original data. It is also no longer landscape. This means whatever I did before will not work with this data file.

This is only one account, hopefully they will have more test accounts to review.

Is there anyway they can center the statement a bit. It is pretty close to the left for the whole punch.

Is it still to be duplex? will the summary page be printing on the back of the cover page or on new page?

comment: [~yameelee]- What do you mean not landscape. When I open, it's landscape. See attached and advise.

comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] So the new test data file shifted everything on the cover page, I have to redo the positions to capture everything correctly. Should be able to provide first sample 4/22 to client.

I can work with this file for now, but when it gets to the scripting, I will need to have the files sent to us in the correct naming convention - also encrypted as well.

Will there be a new paperless file or are we using the same one statement is using now. Currently I only see account type 'S' and 'D' in there. If it is using the same file, will need some accounts with 'W' to test suppression.

Let me know if you need anything else.

comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]just wanted to comment based on my zoom message. after generating the afp from redtitan, found out papyrus does not work with the color afp. We will need to test it with generating tiff from redtitan instead of afp. Also it will be extra hours for this as the data format has changed (shifted down due to logo added and colors), so we have to change alot of the work we did before.

Once tested with the tiffs from redtitan, will see if we have more issues with color etc. Will provide update 4/14.

comment: [~yameelee]- Updated test file attached without colors as you suggested. Please update/add the colors so we can conduct another test print.

comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]I looked at a few of the PDFs and they all have some colored pages. Not every page has color though.



Also, not sure about the add colors part, is that from a meeting with you and Peter? I remembered Peter said you guys had a meeting about the colors and I was not there.

There are 305 pages total for 19 accounts. I think all should be printed so we can check heavy file as well as presort file.

comment: FYI: Projects BKPLWM11.dfa (format) and BKPLWM12.dfa (print) are exported to qa folder. All resources on parallel and redtitan (test) are up-to-date as of now. Just need to see if client will make more update.

Only tested paper as we are still missing some specs for estmt and archival.
