title: CAIG Set up CRON for Print Applications
description: Set up a cron job that runs every 30 minutes to scan for files. It should do the following:

 Check /d/ftpbu/caigbu folder for files. If there are files, mv the files to an empty temp folder. Create the backup folder in /d/download/caig folder for that date and copy the files from the temp folder over. There should only be 1 backup folder for each days files. Move the files in the temp folder to the prisma folders on rhs2. The folder names are /d/prisma_$queue_name where $queue_name comes from the Queue Name column of the spreadsheet (the one from Calvin), e.g. /d/prisma_CAIG_Auto_Renewal, etc. There are total of 14 queues. Look at the Partial Filenames/Keywords column for the keywords to search on the filename to determine which queue to move to. At the end of the moving, the temp folder should be empty and ready for the next scan. The queue names will show up on Prisma All job screen in the Queue name column.
  No need to set up for the test environment, just production will do.
  Remove folders older than 30 days in the backup folders.

*IS to search the file names/keywords for CRL queue first. Then BOP queue second. These files for CRL and BOP come in together.
