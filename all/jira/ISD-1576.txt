comment: These two account numbers, 101966702 and 101966706 hadn't gone through enrollment until 12/23, that's why there were no records of these accounts in the external enrollment reports up to this point.

comment: There was a configuration on InfoTRAC that was set to unenroll users when the delivery preference was changed.

I've changed it so that this action is no longer happening.

When users are unenrolled, they no longer show up on the external enrollment reports, which is why records were no longer showing.

I've tested on pilot environment, and see that now when users' delivery preferences are changed on InfoTRAC, they are no longer unenrolled, so this should fix the issue of records disappearing from the external enrollment report.
