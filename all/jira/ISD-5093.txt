title: 21845 - ACBK - Undefined error in Acct Dropdown list
description: Customer logged in via SSO and saw 'undefined undefined' in the account dropdown list instead of the acct description. 

* Issue was reported morning of 8/4, however client mentions it started happening a few days ago. This is the only customer who reported it so far.
* Issue is not consistent. Customer can still click and select different accounts in the dropdown, when clicking on an account it will randomly show as 'undefined undefined'.
* User encountered error on 8/4 around 8am PST but did not see error around 2:22pm PST. I attached logs which include both of these attempts.

* Logs from 8/4 showing their login attempts: 20210804_logs.txt

I tried looking at the logs earlier, however I do not see anything out of the ordinary so I'm not sure where the issue lies. I asked the client if they can provide what browser/device they used to login just in case, although not sure if this matters.

comment: Thanks [~sadman anik], do you know what caused it? I was not able to replicate the issue myself, so I'm just curious how it happened.

It was happening when the user was clicking on the account type description part of showing account from the account selector drop-down list.

And its not only ACBK, any client who clicked on the Account Type Description part on any account from the account selector menu list should facing this issue.That means they were unable to access that account statement because it was saying "*Service is temporary down*" because from that click event it was getting null account num and saw *undefined undefined* on the account selector menu.



You can reproduce it on the previous code if you are login and then click on the account type description part from the account drop-down list.

e.g. If on drop down, it's showing "*Check Account XXXXX*". then if you click on "*Check Account*" part then you will rise that bug.



Thanks,
