I have decided to update the Document Index format for the eStatement lite project.  This way it should cover eNotice and eTax should we needed and simplify the work we have to do on our side.  Please review and let me know if you see any issue.  I added the link to confluence.

I have verified confluence page and parameters look good. I have created new pdf data file handler class and was able to post statements.
