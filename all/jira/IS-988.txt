title: MFCU - [26940] [pvt] Daily Letters 22, 44, 71 and 83 - Update Enclosures perm solution - Live 5/12
description: Request from client:

We have three items that periodically need to update InfoImage: branch manager signatures, rate sheet and fee schedule. The rate sheet and fee scheduled are on a predictable schedule like weekly and monthly where as the branch manager signatures can come at any time depending on staffing changes.

Is there an automated way we can do it, even for the rate sheet or free schedule that are predictable? The issue there is the rate sheet isnt finalized until like 2 to 3 days prior to month end sometimes. There is very little lead time.

*IS Assessment:*
IS (Print team) will embed the enclosure resources so that ISD (eStmt Team) does not need to load separately.

Deliverables needed from client:

Include the date in the enclosure file names to prevent overwriting.
* Send the enclosure files in the seg 1 zipped data file for every cycle to prevent using wrong enclosure files in the case of reprocessing.
* Provide enclosure files in hi res (300 dpi) compressed B/W TIFF format         
* Proposed file names: (use same date as zipped file date)
mfcu_deposit_rates_mmddyyyy.tiff
mfcu_fee_schedule_mmddyyyy.tiff
* Suggest client sends the 1st cycle as segment 3 for production approval.

Client sent a segment 1 test file to the test FTP directory. Please use for testing.

comment: Hi Anwar, please advise the status on this. This needs to go live before the end of April otherwise we have to do it manually again.

comment: Hi [~andreav], I got the test file and working on it. Will let you know once I have it ready. Should be finished by this month. Thanks


author: andreav
comment: [~anwarh] - Client would like to know if we can move the live date up to 4/27 or 4/28 so that it is not going live on a Friday? Otherwise, we may need to push the live date to next month and do the manual process again.

comment: [~andreav], Pdf samples are in `/z/download/mfcudla/pdf/`


author: andreav
comment: I don't think I have access to that folder. [~enricob] - Can you place the samples in my secure share folder?


author: andreav
comment: [~anwarh]Anwar, I checked the eStatements on InfoTRAC Pilot and the wrong fee and rate inserts are included. They are for March but they should be dated for April. Please fix and repost. 


author: andreav
comment: -[~anwarh] - As discussed. please provide pdf print samples with the barcodes tomorrow so that client can validate they are printing simplex/duplex correctly. In the meantime, I will have OPS print the samples scan them. This may help.-deleted text--

@Anwar - No need to provide pdf print samples with barcodes since the rate and fee inserts are both 1 simplex page. Client is fine with the samples we provided.


author: andreav

author: andreav
comment: [~Igor.Khosid] - I cannot attached the approved samples here because the files are too large. Can you access them on TS26940?


author: igor.khosid
comment: [~andreav]
As per our agreement - please attach approve samples to https://app.smartsheet.com/sheets/2J7mMh6C8mjQ5CqJ9JmFp3gv87Rc7R2h4Wx3Vhx1 :)


author: andreav
comment: [~Igor.Khosid] - OK, will do. Letter 44 is mistakenly duplicated, do you want me to change it to letter 83 or will you do that? Also, I think story should be IS-988 or am I looking at the wrong section?

comment: Hi  [~anwarh] , [~andreav]
Mailer ID on the letter 071  - correct,
However, I'm unable to scan IMB code on the heavies samples for the letters 022, 044 and 083
IMB code shows - only 25 characters instead of 31. 
Missing *zip suffix* and *DP* (delivery point)



author: andreav

author: andreav

comment: Hi [~anwarh],
Wonder if you saw my previous comments?
I'm unable to scan IMB code on the heavies samples for the letters 022, 044 and 083
IMB code shows - only 25 characters instead of 31.
Missing zip suffix and DP (delivery point)

[~andreav] - FYI


author: anwarh
comment: [~Igor.Khosid], I'm not sure, but I checked other app and it's same. Can you please check with someone who has knowledge about this?


author: igor.khosid
comment: [~andreav] [~anwarh]
I just checked with Tina on that. Sounds like this is not an issue.
For the MFCU this expected in case of the bad address - not to display >>> zip suffix and DP
The post office will use in addition the endorsement 


author: andreav
comment: @Anwar Hossain - Client requests to print the rate and fee schedule on 1 sheet of paper so Rate Sheet prints on back of Fee Schedule. Please provide new small samples for approval and add them to this ticket if possible.
