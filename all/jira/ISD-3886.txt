title: 17401 - EWBB - Missing Etax
description: Missing 1098, 1099INT and 1042S forms. Some accts did not seem like it existed in the data file the client sent us, others were new accts that did not post due to acct creation being turned off.


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: Sent list of accts that failed to post. Pending client response on whether these accts should have statements posted.


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: On two calls with client and one internal call to discuss the loan accts in the 1098 file not getting posted. EWBB will confirm on their end whether the mortgage/loan accts should be getting taxes.

comment: Closing this one, mostly just conversation about the emails which is moved to TS 17575
