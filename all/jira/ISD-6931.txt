comment: [~andreav] Is this a new enotice? I didn't see any assessment from ISD for this.


author: andreav
comment: Yes, it is a new notice. Looks like the TS ticket was never assigned to ISD for assessement! Sorry about that, only IS did an assessement. Do you want me to reassign the ticket to you for assessement? BTW, the set up for this notice is waived so it is just a matter of ISD coding to post the notice.

comment: I don't see letter 165 posted on InfoTRAC pilot for the client to review. I checked the most recent posting and no records come up. Also, when I check the eStatement tracking, only letter 071 is posted.
