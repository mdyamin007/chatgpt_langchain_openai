-----------------

This is one time mail. Follow Direct Mail procedure like FFINDM4.dfa . You can name new dfa as FFINDM6.dfa. But please in server first.

Need source file instead of control file.

Although 7 letters use only one dfa, merge all the data files into one data file manually and add extra column by yourself so that you know which line is for which letter and before release the code provide the data file to ac to provide to Dp to run in production.

See comment 12 for data file.

See comment 27 from careport [https://app.na3.teamsupport.com/?TicketNumber=33887] for new template. We will get tiff image for those template and we will use those directly as 2nd page.

The tiff images that are provided has the verbiage "customer address". Can you confirm if it this line should be there. If not is it possible to provide a new tiff without the verbiage.

comment: Samples are ready for customer review.
[~tohidulI] take a look at generated afp2pdf files in folder -> /d/iss/qa/afpprint/FFIN/1724/
There is a missing stock code on the forms.

Source files have parameters:
   *format="simplex"*
and without parameter:
   *texas = "y"*

Is it right?


author: tohiduli
comment: Hi[~Andrey.Kutsenko]

attached new dpvs. the stock codes should be there now.
||New DPVS||Print Range||
|[^ffin0008.print]|1-4|
|[^ffin0009.print]|1-4|
|[^ffin0010.print]|1-4|
|[^ffin0011.print]|1-4|
|[^ffin0012.print]|1-4|
|[^ffin0013.print]|1-4|
|[^ffin0014.print]|1-4|



And source file parameter *format="simplex"* and *texas = "y"* is used from previous ffin direct mail project. Can you confirm it with [~MattL]if the print location is in *texas* and the page format is *simplex* as the previous ffin direct mail project?

comment: Hi [~tohidulI] please provide correct file.
'ffin0009_new_sample.pdf'- it is not"Erin Customer Closing Letter"
'ffin0009_new_sample.pdf' the same 'ffin0010_new_sample.pdf'


author: mattl
comment: Hi [~Andrey.Kutsenko]yes this is Simplex & this is printing in Texas.


author: tohiduli
comment: Hi [~Andrey.Kutsenko] 

attached the correct "Erin customer closing letter"

[^ffin0009_new_sample.pdf]

added texas="y" in the source file

the format="simplex" flag is there because the page format will be simplex


author: mattl
comment: Hi [~tohidulI]FFIN 0009 is still incorrect. It Should be Erin Customer Closing letter but it is still reading Industrial Park.
