comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid],

This is ready for QA in staging.

We are currently sending out email either directly or via API.  This enhancement allows us to to converts AFP to PDF concurrently for attachment if email is sent via API.

There are three test scenarios.
1. Directly (Concurrency has no effect)
2. Via API (with concurrency)
2. Via API (without concurrency)

I have setup the environment with the assumption that Natasha Primak will be doing the testing.  If that is not the case, reach out to me to update the email.

To test "DIRECTLY" method:
ca-pui-st-01:/usr/local/processing-ui/conf/hebc.conf:  (check these settings)
  email.featureType=attach|sms  (must have attach as one of the feature)
  notification.isSendEmailViaAPI=false  (this setting must be either false or commented out)
CID: HEBC
AFP Processing:
  Parallel Run [CHECKED]
  Suppress Email [UN-CHECKED]
  By Pass Dt_jobId search [CHECKED]
  File #1: ms1_10032021_1_10042021_0718_hebc.txt
  acct e.Sup: 1
Then trigger Email Notification.
You should receive a single email.  Check in the "eStatement Email Notification ( Monthly Statements )" log and verify that it does not have "isSendEmailViaAPI is enabled".


To Test "VIA API WITH CONCURRENCY" Method:
ca-pui-st-01:/usr/local/processing-ui/conf/suru.conf:  (check these settings)
  email.default.featureType=attach  (must have attach as one of the feature)
  email.invoice.featureType=attach  (must have attach as one of the feature)
  notification.isSendEmailViaAPI=true  (this setting must be true)
  email.mt.disable=false  (this setting must be either false, commented out or absent)
  global.invoice.needApproval=false  (this setting must be false)
CID: SURU
Document Processing:
  Parallel Run [CHECKED]
  Suppress Email [UN-CHECKED]
  By Pass Dt_jobId search [CHECKED]
  File #1: ml2_20211005_1_20211005_1200_suru.txt
Then trigger Email Notification.
You should receive 68 emails.  You may not receive them all at the same time.  Check in the "eStatement Email Notification ( Invoices )" log and verify that it has "isSendEmailViaAPI is enabled", "enableMT: true" and "PDF Task Submitted".


To Test "VIA API WITHOUT CONCURRENCY" Method:
UNDO the previous posting.  We will be re-using the same index file.
ca-pui-st-01:/usr/local/processing-ui/conf/suru.conf:  (check these settings)
  email.default.featureType=attach  (must have attach as one of the feature) (same as the previous test)
  email.invoice.featureType=attach  (must have attach as one of the feature) (same as the previous test)
  notification.isSendEmailViaAPI=true  (this setting must be true) (same as the previous test)
  email.mt.disable=true  (this setting must be true) (***DIFFERENT*** from the previous test)
  global.invoice.needApproval=false  (this setting must be false) (same as the previous test)
CID: SURU
Document Processing:
  Parallel Run [CHECKED]
  Suppress Email [UN-CHECKED]
  By Pass Dt_jobId search [CHECKED]
  File #1: ml2_20211005_1_20211005_1200_suru.txt
Then trigger Email Notification.
You should receive 68 emails.  You may not receive them all at the same time.  Check in the "eStatement Email Notification ( Invoices )" log and verify that it has "isSendEmailViaAPI is enabled" and "enableMT: false".


Please feel free to reach out to me for assistance.

Thanks.

Verified on staging PUI all tree scenarios, received confirmation email notifications, no issues.

Thank you Lin for help with this project!
