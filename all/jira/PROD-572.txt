comment: [~anil.dasa] this is the feedback I received from APCU's team:

I could add the URLs but I should not need to do that, because that is what the metadata xml provides.



If you look at the link you sent, it has 3 options at the beginning. The example shows adding things manually, where the option right above it is the metadata import and the option above that is the URL to the metadata. The first option is the best, because if you ever change your metadata, we will get a prompt that you have updated it and can just click thru a few prompts and be up to date.



If you would like, we can hop on a WebEx and I can show you some examples of the Party Trusts using metadata URL as we have a few connections with it.



Otherwise, would it be possible if you just sent me the XML file?

[~anil.dasa] is the XML that you provided in the previous comment what they are requesting?

Let me know if best to have a call with them.

Thanks,

Phoebe

You can provide xml file that I have provided in previous comment. They also mentioned about using direct url. They can try with url first and if that does not work, second option is they can use xml file.
