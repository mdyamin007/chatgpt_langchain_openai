Earlier infosync url was redirected to menlo because host name was not added properly on brisbane etc host file entry. I have corrected host name. Can you check again?

Old entry : 10.4.20.71 is-apps-prod.infoimage.com

new entry : 10.4.20.71 is-apps.infoimage.com

comment: [~anil.dasa] - As discussed, it seems the mongo URL has been updated on your side. Can you please provide the new URL? Below is what we are currently using:

*EMAIL_API_BASE_URL*="http://webapp-prod09.infoimageinc.com:8580/infoservice/api/v1/onlineproofing/sendEmail?template_id=jobStatusOLP."
*MONGO_API_BASE_URL*="http://webapp-prod09.infoimageinc.com:8580/infoservice/api/v1/onlineproofing/updateMongo"



Please keep this ticket open until you provide us the URLs for lower env i.e. stage & pilot.
