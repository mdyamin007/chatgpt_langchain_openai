Is there a data file and account that customer want to see samples from? Or is it okay to just add the product types without providing samples?

I couldn't find every product type in the "sacu_stmt_10312022_1.zip.pgp" file. I attached a small file here and copied the big PDF to client pickup. Please ask customer to review the "sacu_35858_Samples_1.pdf" in the client pickup.
