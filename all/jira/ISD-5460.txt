comment: The eStatement job is not posted on InfoTRAC job status. However, I was able to search an account in Account Management and on the 12/31 posting, the masking is there but on the 5/24 posting, there is no masking.

Sean, can you post the eStatement job on InfoTRAC Pilot job status?
Should we remove the May cycle or is this from pre-ingestion testing?
