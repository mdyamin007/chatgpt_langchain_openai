comment: Tanmay, as discussed on call this morning attached are current core mappingsefcu_current_core_mapping.zip for various versions of mortgage noted below. Also included hfs record layout for reference. Please help look up logic/flag within current core code as noted in mapping.
 # Standard Mortgage- we are good and pretty much covered. There is just one verbiage noted in red to confirm if it is hardcoded across all templates.
 # Standard Mortgage with Delinquency- Pretty much covered with mapping. Only need help figuring the logic/flag to include delinquency section.
 # Bankruptcy - i found templates for BK Chap 7 and Chap 13. I am not sure if there is a standard bankruptcy template out there. Please review and let me know if bankruptcy is generated specifically for these two chapters or if there is an additional standard bankruptcy template as well? Also, there are sections highlighted in red to look up in code and confirm logic/flag.
 # Mortgage accounts with Accelerated and Reinstatement Amounts -**we are good and pretty much covered. Please review anything you may want to add for this template.

Thanks for the help!

comment: [~ratnam] updated mapping ([^sefcu_current_core_mapping_dsi_01272022.zip]) with note. please check.
 # *Standard Mortgage- we are good and pretty much covered. There is just one verbiage noted in red to confirm if it is hardcoded across all templates.*
 {color:#ff0000}we missed the red note. can you give a snapshot of it ?{color}
 # *Standard Mortgage with Delinquency- Pretty much covered with mapping. Only need help figuring the logic/flag to include delinquency section.*
 {color:#ff0000}If there is E1 record is present thendelinquency section will be displayed both for standard and BK.{color}
 # *Bankruptcy - i found templates for BK Chap 7 and Chap 13. I am not sure if there is a standard bankruptcy template out there. Please review and let me know if bankruptcy is generated specifically for these two chapters or if there is an additional standard bankruptcy template as well? Also, there are sections highlighted in red to look up in code and confirm logic/flag.*
 {color:#ff0000}Apparently there are two templates, one for BK (7 and 13 ) and standard one. BK templates get displayed when record A1 618-619 is 13 or 7. In BK template there is minor changes based on BK value 7 or 13 but maximum is similar. I have added note on your provided mapping. Moreover i add some additional flag to display certain verbiagebased on code.please check.{color}
 # *Mortgage accounts with Accelerated and Reinstatement Amounts -**we are good and pretty much covered. Please review anything you may want to add for this template.*
 {color:#ff0000}It looks good. this section may appear in BK template as well.{color}

[~ratnam] if there any confusion we can discuss on a quick call

comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]& [~ratnam]: Per [~tanmay]email to me this morning, revised sample date based on clients new round of feedback will be 5/27 instead of 5/24. I also understand from Ratna last Thursday and Monday this week, that it sounds like SEFC +might+++still provide more changes to mapping on Mortgage in addition to the ones we Tanmay is going to provide revised sample. Ratna is not confident that this will be the last round of changes.



[~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]: Per my escalation in the management meeting with [~phoebe.george], Guy and Tomas this morning, I have communicated that SEFC & BlackKnight are still make rounds and rounds of changes and my understanding was that we are to have all the approvals by 6/3 to lock down this application. We the additional delays getting the feedback with this new around of changes, I believe the timeline will have to change again potentially jeopardizing the July live date.



Guy wants us to document via an updated timeline tell them how much timeline will be push further out versus telling them that project will be late. Please consult with [~phoebe.george]in your next staff meeting to discuss about this project and what you need from us to re-establish a new timeline.

  Suppress TRANSACTION from statement
