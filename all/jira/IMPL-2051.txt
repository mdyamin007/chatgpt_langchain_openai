Assessment Details (IS):
 - Parallel required: (Yes)

 - set up new application application for ARM notices

 - Data file naming convention

Example:

IDCU_DL_ARM_<mmddyy>_<segment>#.7z.gpg



Inside 7z file:

LN_XRPCHG_?_<MMDDYYYY>.XML  <=== Data XML

LN_XSINITADJ_?_<MMDDYYYY>.XML <=== Data XML



IDCU_PERM_<MMDDYY>.txt <=== Cross Reference file for archival.


 - Setup processing script,format program, control file
 - preprocessing script to parse the XML files to flat file.

 - Though IDCU have provided the XML data files, to begin coding we will need the complete zipped and encrypted
   submitted file that should contain:
   - XML data files
   - All secondary reference file.
 - In looking at the mappings provided, in secion D "Rate Limits" paragraph, it appears to be incomplete. See attached.
 - Notice Name
 Rate and Payment Change
 Scheduled Interest Rate Change
 - Add "DO NOT MAIL" suppression similar to Escrow Analysis - Set MAIL_CODE to 1
 - Print flat and mail back to CU
 -Add address to SOW at time of update:
 Idaho Central Credit Union
 Information Systems
 4400 Central Way
 Chubbuck, ID 83202
 - Only process those accounts having the following tag: <Major>MTG</Major>
 - Initial test datafile in /d/ftpbu/idcubu/test/.
 LN_XRPCHG_1_03112022.XML.gpg
 LN_XSINITADJ_1_03112022.XML.gpg

 - Test file:

|*File Name*|*Size*|*MD5*|
|Test/IDCU_DL_ARM_051022.7z.gpg|9.92 kb|2215cc69612588342fceb4138bce8776|
