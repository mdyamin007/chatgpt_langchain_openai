comment: [~Ricky Lopez] - DDA stmt has data file for Savings and Non-Savings. Is the priority going to have those? The test data file doesn't have. 

Thanks!


author: JIRAUSER11100
comment: [~Ricky Lopez] - [~Peter.Dang] and [~phoebe.george] mentioned that there is no Reorg and branch 32 statements in Priority statements but the SOW has. Can you please confirm?

Thanks!

comment: Hi [~rukmaniR], is pilot still being tested?


author: JIRAUSER11100
comment: [~Ricky Lopez] - Pilot is ready. If you want us to test selective insert before the customer approval process, you have to initiate it with PC.

Thanks!

comment: [~phoebe.george] [~Ricky Lopez] - Naming convention for cripple image file is: ewbbp{cycle_no}_img.zip.pgp (Eg: ewbbp26_img.zip.pgp) and the index file inside the zip file ewbbp{cycle_no}_idx (Eg: ewbbp26_idx)

Thanks!

author: JIRAUSER11400
comment: [~rukmaniR]-Client has approved, please prepare for final QA. Thanks Ricky


author: JIRAUSER11100
comment: [~Ricky Lopez] [~phoebe.george] - We need confirmation on the cripple naming convention before we move to qa. The test file they provided didn't have any cripple. So I renamed data file from production, tested and have provided the naming convention.

Thanks!
Rukmani


author: JIRAUSER11100
comment: [~phoebe.george] [~Ricky Lopez] - The naming convention for branch 32 image file is: ewbbp{cycleno}_b32_img_zip.pgp [Eg. ewbbp29_b32_img_zip.pgp] and the index file has to be ewbbp{cycleno}_idx [Eg: ewbbp29_idx]

Thanks!

comment: Hi [~rukmaniR], please attach IS checklist.
Thanks.



author: JIRAUSER11100
comment: [~Andrey.Kutsenko] - I checked with Peter and he asked me to test few more things for safety and to make sure that the DDA process is not running at the same time. Since we can't test during this month end, I'll let you know after the month end.

Thanks!

author: JIRAUSER11100
comment: [~phoebe.george] [~Ricky Lopez] [~Andrey.Kutsenko] - Testing is done. I tested for:
1. Run the process in cron
2. Processing folder to /z/ewbb/priority
3. The dda process is not running at the same time with priority and vice versa.
