title: MSBK [20722] [pvt] [In House] DP Enhancement:  Turn on MSBK AOLP for Taxes
description: Per Tai MSBK AOLP is turned off on the ISD side. It's been that way for at least a year now.



We can turn it on. Please have AC create an internal JIRA ticket to track this change. We should also test a cycle on Pilot/Staging.



If I'm not mistaken, PC will also need to turn on AOLP. They can also get involved after the JIRA ticket is created.
