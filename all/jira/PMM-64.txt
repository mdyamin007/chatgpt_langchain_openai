comment: # PDF should not have high resolution graphic or color in body content such as water mark or header box.
 # File size and/or record size limitation. Redtitan software run under 32bits and has issue with memory leak which caused the program to crash.
 # Must have unique anchor field to be able differentiate each account break. i.e Page 1 label;
 # Any mail handling logic such as suppression will need to review and confirm by IS. Except logic is captured from the address block such as DO NOT MAIL.
 # Account number should be easy to capture and must not be masked for Estmt, PDF archival, Insert by account, etc. Account number field is required for these services.
 # Clearance zone margin should be .625 Right and .5 left. These space are reserved from OMR, 2D stock code.
