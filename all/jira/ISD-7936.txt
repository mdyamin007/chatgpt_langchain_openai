The disclosure is updated and ready for review on pilot. The client needs to test with an unenrolled account so that the disclosure could be displayed on the enrollment page.

Per SSCU,
There are two references to "SAFE" that have odd symbols in them. Can these be corrected? Screenshot is attached. (Screenshot_10.17.22) !Screenshot_10.17.22.jpg|thumbnail!

Please use [http://client-test.infoimageinc.com:8070/sso/]and a randome account number to check, so that it will direct to the enrollment page.
