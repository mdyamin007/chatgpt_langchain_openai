title: GECU - [19582][pvt][in-house] DP / GECU DL eStmt DTJOBID = "null" on PUI
description: *Project Name*: eStmt DT_JOB_ID Null PUI In-house Fix



*Programming Hours:* 10



*IS Assessment:*



Refer to to the following smartsheet and update the rows that requires update of estmt_trac=y, infotrac='m' ONLY. The other items will need other dedicated resources to change the custom programming. I count 32 applications that meets this scenario to have the control files updated.

[https://app.smartsheet.com/sheets/cQ99FGc8wGCH4jhMpG4gfR3Jm3W64mXFg6x8vv41]



DP will need to work with PC & ISD to create DT_JOB_ID on Stage and verify the changes works. If so, update the Smartsheet with a status that Testing was Successful.



Once all successful, we can release this during mid-May or earlier.

comment: [~jun]: Please remind me on Friday to walk through this project with you before you start the control file updates. Most of the effort testing will be done by DP. They will just report any project related errors into smartsheet. Only focus on the ones with your name assigned to it.
