index file is*dla_20220619_1_20220621_1320_whcu.txt*
can you please post this index file into pilot ?

Thanks

The two index files failed to process. They both have too many elements per entry.


author: rony
comment: Hi [~mac]

We are converting from old index format to new index format which is why there is so many columns. May be isd needs to work on their side too for this.

This is a new format:

!image-2022-06-22-08-44-48-238.png!

And old format is:

Please ignore the previous index file for ds1. Please use this oneds1_20220620_1_20220622_1303_whcu.txt. But again this is new index format.

comment: [~mac] I can't view the 1042S file in the pilot site based on the account numbers from the pilot PUI. Can you confirm if you can see it? 

[~Ricky Lopez]


author: JIRAUSER10913
comment: [~phoebe.george]

Which account numbers? Some accounts didn't process from the index file as they don't exist.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~mac] I could note locate any of the account numbers in the pilot Admin portal that were part of the 1042S index file (I pulled this from the pilot PUI).

Can you confirm if you can view the posted cycle on pilot?

[~rony] Once Mac confirms, we would actually need all the tax forms posted to pilot - they should all be part of the tax production file from January.

comment: [~phoebe.george] [~Ricky Lopez]

Okay, the job needed, approval. You can see the 1042s now.

Not, all the accounts were processed as some doesn't exist.

939773, 940752, 941540 are some you can try.

Any updates as if the client was able to test? It has passed the soft launch date, so just want to know if the client was able to test.

comment: [~rony][~mac]-Needed to ask about amount of accounts posted, it looks like only 100. Are we able to provide the full file for posting to pilot?


author: rony
comment: Hi [~Ricky Lopez]

Hmm actually it might take good amount of time to process a big data file. Our task is to convert the old index to new. Isn't it sufficient to see this change with the small index file? But let me know if you really need index with full file.

Hi Rony,

It has been posted. For some reason, when you ask me to post the file, someone has it posted already. Is someone posting it for me?

Thanks.


author: rony
comment: Hi [~mac]

Hmm actually it supposed to autopost from our configuration. But since we don't have access to pui site we don't quite know if it is posted or not. Hence, we always provide the index file name to isd and ask to post but if it is already posted you don't need to post again just confirming will be enough that it has been posted already.
