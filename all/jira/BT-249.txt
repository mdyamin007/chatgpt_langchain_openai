title: Notice description should be displayed for notices as "Collection Letter"
description: None

comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] [~gthillaivel] I believe collection letters is just a general name for all the different notice codes. Based on the SOW, here is what I am seeing for the following letter codes:
104 - Military Loan
106 - Overdrawn Status Notice
109 - Student Checking Letters

Is this still expected? If so, then I don't think this is a bug. If not, then please provide the updated letter descriptions and I can make the adjustment.
