title: 16877 - CFCU - Insert date issue
description: Generally, inserts will show next to the statement as long as the statement closing date is within the range of the begin and closing date. However it seems like the admin site is not tracking the year correctly if the begin date and closing dates have different year values.



For example:

An insert for a 12/31/20 statement will not appear if the insert dates are something like begin date 12/30/20 and closing date 1/6/21. This insert will only show next to the statement if the closing date is 12/31/20 (same year as the statement closing date).



So far I've only noticed this for CFCU, however it may be a common issue among prism clients who still use the admin site and not InfoTrac. Please look into a few other prism clients as well to confirm.
