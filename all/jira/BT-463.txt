title: SOW uses outdated format
description: Compared to other projects, it looks like the SOW currently follows some outdated format:
 # there is no*Updates after IS/ISD Turn Over* table,
 # there is no*2.2 Elected Features table*,
 # data that is usually found in section 3, Business Rules, is piled between 2.3 and 2.3.1,

etc, etc.

(3)actually looks like the document was left unfinished.

comment: [~avannik]-we mirrored an existing application, we replicated the SOW for the other application and it is an older format.

comment: [~avannik]-Phoebe said we could go with this format for this one. I will use updated template on any future applications

comment: [~Ricky Lopez]old or new format, SOW must be finished. Look here:

!sow.png|width=898,height=506!

Data is piled into 2.3 File Handling Convention that doesn't belong there.
