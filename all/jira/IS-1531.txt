title: FCBT[pvt][30831]: Enable automated advanced online proofing for print/electronic - Funds Held Statements (ml1)
description: As a permanent solution for L3 30831, configure setting up AOLP for electronic for the below CID's/Applications;

CID's:
CAFC
CTFC
FCBA
ALFC
MILB

Enable electronic AOLP as well for ALL of their LIQ applications:

LIQ Simple Bills
LIQ Simple Statements
LIQ Complex Bills
LIQ Complex Statements
Funds Held
Daily Notices

This will allow for the auto-posting needed to fully automate for these associations to eliminate the manual posting needed on the DP side once print samples are approved.

Note that this should ONLY be done for the above CID's. All other CID's (aside from PLBA which doesn't have AOLP) still have bills generated from their other core.

Enabling/Automation should be for the following:

Print AOLP
Electronic AOLP
Auto-posting
Auto-email trigger

I verified the outcomes on INFOTRAC are ok that online approving icons appear for all CIDs, and PDFs are generated successfully.

Please noted that all CIDs are processed successfully on stage except FCBA since data file is missing, and it was never process on production too. The only process I could found for fcbaml1 is on parallel but the process date is on the year of 2020.

I attached an image below show that online proofing account is showing properly.

comment: QA - completed

comment: [~Tevis Mak] With QA previously completed, can you confirm how much lead time you would need to move forward with this if customer confirms approved to proceed and take off hold?

comment: Hi [~phoebe.george],

Per my conversation with Peter, it will need to wait for other tickets to pass QA too and release together. After customer approved, it will need to go through the final round of QA. Master parallel is recommended, but it can be bypass if it is in rush, but we will need someone to check if the first cycle processed successfully on production. 

Thanks,
Tevis
