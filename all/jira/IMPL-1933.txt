Letter 123:
Is it possible to make this notice print and mail but at the same time post to the eportal for member online access?
Would you please change the setting for letter 123, Business Analysis Statement, to paper only?

Some organizations do not have access to online banking so they cannot view enotices. This change will need to be implemented by 2/28.

Thank you.
