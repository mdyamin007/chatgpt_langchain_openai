title: UTCU - [26123][pvt] DL XREF update:  Correct Missing eNotices for DL-10 (CC-Late notices) 
description: UTCU - DL XREF update: Correct Missing eNotices DL-10 (CC-Late notices)
*App*: DL
*Description*:Update UTCU XREF for their enotice to start using the UTCU_XREF_MBR_CC xref. This is to update the missing eNotices for DL-10 (CC-Late notices)
*Parallel required: (No)

*Hours*: 4 hours
*Timeline:* 
 * Turnover Date : 04/12/2022
 * Sample to QA Date: 04/01/2022
 * Sample Approval Date: 04/22/2022 
 * Go live date : 04/11/2022

Assessment Details (IS):
 * Parallel required: (No) Please QA for suppressing CC-late accounts issue in comment #19 and #20 is fixed.
 * Update UTCU for their enotice to start using the UTCU_XREF_MBR_CC xref
 * Need to update trans_acct_member_utcudla.pl to use and support UTCU_XREF_MBR_CC.txt.
 * The reason is for this update is:

 ** CC-late accounts are suppressed because they are missing from the cross reference file (UTCU_noticexref.csv ).
And the account numbers are not the same between the other notice and notice 10. The last digit is off on the CC notice
 * Currently, Only pdf archival uses UTCU_XREF_MBR_CC.txt,
Enotice uses UTCU_noticexref.csv from /d/custdata/utcu

comment: [~barnetts]: Since both this project IS-844 and IS-907 project are related to suppression, align these two projects to be released by 4/11 instead?



Move up this project IS-844 project from 4/26 to 4/11?

Move later the project IS-907 live date from 3/29 to 4/11



Please advise.



Thanksl!
