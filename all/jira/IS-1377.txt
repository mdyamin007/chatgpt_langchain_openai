comment: [~thomasY] - Do you need print SOWs for every application even if no print?? Or should we add into the eStatement SOW?


author: andreav
comment: I have included eSOWs in description. My latest updates are highlighted in blue in the eStatement SOW.


author: andreav

author: thomasy
comment: [~andreav]Do you have the Version ID and App number? I do not see it on the SoW. We don't need a print SoW but we do need those numbers.


author: andreav
comment: Sorry Thomas, since that is not included in the eStatement SOW, I missed that. I will request from PC and include you in the email since I am OOO tomorrow.

comment: [~thomasY] - Please give ISD the eStatements files for Loan Bills to post on pilot. Per Diego, he will pass Taxes a bit later once analysis is done.


author: andreav
comment: Hi Thomas, d3 sent the below files per Diego's request to add the timestamp and use underscores instead of spaces for the Loan index files:

I ran some of todays files and posted NAV-LOAN_D3-II_202209220850.zip to the test folder on the sFTP site.

The index file is named:  NAV-LOAN_D3-II_202209220850_Statement_Index_File.txt



author: andreav
comment: Thomas, what is the status of the tax index files for ISD to post? Client needs to see these for final approval due tomorrow, 10/11.


author: thomasy
comment: [~andreav]Can you update the live date? I'm not sure what the expected live date is now.


author: andreav
comment: [~thomasY] - I updated the live date to 11/9 per the timeline.


author: thomasy
comment: [~andreav]Have stmts and loan bills been approved already?


author: andreav
comment: [~thomasY] - So far, client seems to be OK with the docs posted. The issues/inquiries they are having are on the Admin functionality side. They plan to give full approval tomorrow so we can move forward with QA.


author: andreav
comment: [~thomasY] 11/10 - Client has approved pilot, please move to QA for parallel.
