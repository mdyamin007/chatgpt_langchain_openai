description: SEFC Daily Letter Setup - Core Conversion to BK

There will be 2 types that will be setup.

*Batch Notices SOW:* [http://sharepoint-svr/AS/Shared%20Documents/SOW%20Directory/SEFC%20-%20SEFCU/SOWs/SEFC_Batch%20Daily%20Letters_Print%20SOW_BK%20Conversion_2.7.22.docx]



*For IS Programmer:*

Create universal preprocessing script (${home_master}/master/black_night_batch_preprocessing.*) to split the files using client codes (CO001) to individual files using Infoimage code (dl101.dat) using file list in ${home_env}/${keep_dir}/Black_Knight/batch/<cid><jid>_BK_batch_list.txt.

Create processing scripts (use sefcdl*d*similiar to sefcdlc processing script to keep all the reports the same).

comment: Hi [~rukmaniR]- Please note, I updated the SOW, section 1.1 with the following...

1) Per JEF 43817  setup selective insert program to insert SEFCU Forbearance Plan (32513) in 2 letters. New letter codes are CO001 and CO002.

Let me know if you have any questions.




author: JIRAUSER11100
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] Is the insert  for all of CO001 and CO002 or selective within those two notices?


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~rukmaniR]- This is for ALL letters that are CO001 and CO002. It is not selective within the notices.


author: JIRAUSER11100
comment: Thanks [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]. Can you please update the SOW with this and the bin number? I'm not able to download the latest SOW. It gives me error message that it can't be downloaded securely.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~rukmaniR]- done!




author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~rukmaniR]-FYI I updated the SOW. We are to MASK the account numbers except the last 4 digits.

comment: Hi[~zhuoxinT][~rukmaniR]CU wants to change eStatement index to use*DNA_Account*within cross reference file instead of Member_Number. I updated SOW. Please review and program accordingly.

comment: [~rukmaniR] Please take a look at the anchor logic.
If the first statement in the batch file has a different anchor then the next statement is skipped.

Can you please post this index file:dle_20220616_1_20220616_1135_sefc.txt?

This is for one-off. Also attached in IS-871.
FYI [~Andrey.Kutsenko]


author: JIRAUSER11100
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] - You might have to setup the link as ARM notices instead of Initial and Subsequent notice since the ltr code and afp code is 301 for both. 

Thanks!


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] Currently letter code 301 has description "Initial Rate Notice" in our database, however the SOW shows both "Subsequent Rate Notice" and "Initial Rate Notice". Since it's one letter code, we have to either combine them or change it to something like ARM notices which Rukmani suggested. What should the description be for letter 301?

comment: [~zhuoxinT] I tried posting dle_20220616_1_20220616_1135_sefc.txt, but I'm receiving an error: infoTrac_flag is on but dt_job_id is missing from dataTrac(IS) database. Can you check if there's anything missing on your side?
