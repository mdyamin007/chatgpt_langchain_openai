comment: Jessica:

The test file,II.IDLTILAMOD.05212021.txt and the fields specified in the layout,IDL TILA Loan Modification - Layout.doc file are not sync. Staring from field 21 and up, it starts to be off by 1. SeeIS-132_clarification_063020210524.png file attached.

Also attaching the layout and test file for review.

Please have TKCU review their layout and test file.

comment: [~Jessica]: Can you review Nar's comment above regarding the missing field. This is holding up his development and providing sample date of 7/2 that already passed. The "Full Name" field is missing. The timeline is affected by this. Please advise.




author: jessica
comment: I requested the new file in Team support on 7/2. Customer has provided a new file today 7/8. I have attached it to this story. Please provide a new sample date.

comment: [~billr] from the SOW it looks like the new enotice code/description is 101 - 'Notice Description TILA Loan Modification'. Is this correct? I've never seen an enotice have 'Notice Description' in the actual displayed name, so just wanted to confirm before I add that in.


author: igor.khosid
comment: [~billr]any updates on the eNotice descriptions?

[~Shun.Kuwashima]

Shun, Index file processed successfully, however just a few questions:
 # Index file "tkcu_afp_enotice_07082021_161952_1.txt" processed - please check PUI - missing DT Job ID and I can't allocate new record on the "Job Status" tab in InfoTrac[^PUI_Missing DT JobID.pdf]
 # Notice name description "Document" instead of "Notice Description TILA Loan Modification" >>>> I believe you waiting Bill to reply to your question[^Notice name_description.pdf]


author: billr
comment: Igor/Shun, Customer responded to eNotice descriptions on ticket 20201, comment 63:

The eNotice Description should -Loan Modification Notice


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: Thanks [~billr], I'll work on making the update. Can you update the SOW to reflect the correct enotice description?


author: billr
comment: Thanks Shun, the SOW has been updated:http://sharepoint-svr/AS/Shared%20Documents/SOW%20Directory/TKCU%20-%20Tinker%20Federal%20Credit%20Union/SOW/TKCU_DL_SOW_031220.doc


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: Thanks Bill.

[~Igor.Khosid], I added the notice description on stage and it should be showing now on tkcu's admin site.

[~jira_naru]: Do we need to test the job status portion on infotrac? I don't see a DTJOBID tied to the index file and I'm not sure if we tested this on past notice setups, so I'm not sure if this is expected.
