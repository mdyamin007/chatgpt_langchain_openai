comment: Hi,[~kericapote]any update?


author: william.kong
comment: [~kericapote] and [~phoebe.george]: We have not gotten update for this. Please advise if we need to cancel and bill out the client. This is impacting our over resourcing for upcoming projects. Please advise.



I'm putting this project on hold due to no communication



[~rony]/[~Peter.Dang]: FYI.

comment: [~kericapote] when you return to office, please update all the live dates and status on these tickets for the programmers/developers.

[~rony] client is actively testing, based on responses on ticket #20004. Sorry there have not been updates directly to this ticket.

[~William.Kong] if we have to shift resources off this project to assign elsewhere, please bring up in the IS resource meeting so I can relay updates and/or update client accordingly. 

If there is a priority project, we can shift resources off of this, but please discuss in the weekly resource meeting first before putting a project on hold.

What is the actual *target date*?

Also do we need to test eSite? if yes, what ISD story assigned? ON the epic there are 2 stories *ISD-4674* (Status "*Done*") and *ISD-4674* (Status "*Hold*")

Are we still waiting for client approval?

please confirm:msg will appear b/w for paper and archival.

andmsg will appear color on eside? or b/w as well?


author: kericapote
comment: [~berezinez] Yes that is correct. Black and white for print and archive and color on e. Customer has approved the pilot site as stated on the comments above. (Is there a better place to put approvals where it is easily seen and you don't have to search trough pages and pages of comments?).

comment: [~rony] [~tanmay] per my Skype message do not release code until customer gives the ok.


author: kericapote
comment: [~rony] [~tanmay] [~Peter.Dang] I just got the ok from FNBK to release code with the No Message box checked and they will upload a message when they are ready.

Let me know when you release code.

Also ISD is requesting resources on their ticket.



Thanks!


author: rony
comment: Hi [~kericapote] [~Peter.Dang]

Looks like code is not released yet.

if I release the codeand client doesn't upload messageany cycle that will come after my release will be failed and there are no new resources for ISD. So what do you think should I release now?



Thanks,

Rony


author: kericapote
comment: [~rony] Yes ok to release. Let me know when it is released and I will go in and make the change I need.
