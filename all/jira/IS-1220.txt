title: KYCU - Letter - Daily NoticePDFi Conversion to AFP2PDF Python [InHse]
description: Update existing processing script to no longer use PDFi tool to create pdf.
 Instead use afp2pdf.py program with index_build_multicore option for ALL statement related apps.
 The smaller daily notice jobs can use the current index_build options.

All the zip file, pgp encryption, index file contents, and PDF file naming convention must remain exactly the same original specifications.

Please ensure the standard SOP on the directory structure must be followed: 
 ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/pdf, ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/zip, ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/work is followed.
 Also, clear the folder directory folder before each processing. We do NOT want to accumulate previous runs.

The current program should support checking total PDF counts verification to make sure the expected pdf matches the total number for pdfs generated; If not, incorporate this standard verification logic

DT_JOB_ID:
 133588-C30.01-V21727

Processing Scripts to modify:
 kycudla_process.sh

Data Files to use:
 KYCU_DN_06102022.zip.pgp



*NOTE*: This job runs on RH2. Since we are migrating from RHS to RH2, we should test all options so that we can do afpcompare and also ensure there is no errors in the processing logs.

Thanks,

comment: [~Andrey.Kutsenko]/[~Igor.Khosid]: As Anwar stated, the date is going to be different. Outside of that the index file content is good.



I've placed the files in:

ca-unittest-pr-02:/d/pdf_compare/kycudla_prod/

ca-unittest-pr-02:/d/pdf_compare/kycudla_parallel/



[~Andrey.Kutsenko]: The PDF specifications for this application has spaces in the PDF file names. If you run into PDF compare issues again, please don't hesitate to let me know again (i.e. compare utility complains differences, but you don't see diff pdf files in the result folder). Thanks!
