comment: [~MattL], you'll need to create this as an "Epic" type ticket, not a sub-task. You should see a field called "Issue Type" when you create a ticket and it should be defaulted to "epic." Also, hours and date need to be filled in, you should see a tab for both print and electronic so you can enter those values in
