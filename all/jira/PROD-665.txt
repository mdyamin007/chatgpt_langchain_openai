Hi Jun

Can you confirm that the script that we discussed to systematically remove blocks after 10 mins is in place?

Thanks!

Hi Kent,

Blocking sessions which went idle and holding locks for quite some time (order of 10's of minutes or longer) is something that should not occur normally. When session is terminated, all the updates get rolled back, so whether it's harmful or not depend on how application recover from this. If application performs multiple transactions and commits some of them and goes idle with blocking locks, maybe it might be difficult to recover, but usually applications should be designed with possibility of transaction failing and automatically recover from this. I don't believe terminating idle blocking sessions which has gone idle for more than some threshold minutes of time should not be detrimental when that might be needed to be done manually anyway to resolve the blocking issue.

Thank you

Jun
