comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid]

I am trying to explain the history of this ticket briefly:

The original UFCU_mtg_061622_1.xml.pgp file that the client sent in production had total of 11383 accounts. Later client complained they are missing lots of accounts. Then we asked the client to resend the data fileUFCU_mtg_061622_1.xml.pgp to check. And we checked that the resent data file has 13468 accounts. So the original data was missing over 2000 accounts.

Now by discussing with the client, we came to a decision that, we will reprocess this new file and this time we will mail only the missing accounts (the accounts in resent file that were not in the originally sent file) with insert bin 2 but create an archival sample for all accounts.



[^ufcuml1_06162022_1.account.list]this is the list of accounts with original data files for which we will not send mail this time so we will suppress those accounts this time.

UFCU_mtg_061622_2.xml.pgp this data file which is in /z/download/ufcu/ has all the accounts 13468 .

So to suppress original accounts and also adding insert 2 for missing accounts we modified 2 flags in insert file:

!image-2022-08-23-18-49-57-712.png!



MC_BY_ACCT will suppress the original accounts those already got mail. INSERT2 setting will responsible to have all the non suppressed meaning the missing accounts (or new accounts in current data file ) to have insert 2.

/d/ac-secure-share/qa/IgorK/ufcu_MTG_archival_06162022_2.zip.001 archival sample.





[^ufcuml1216-1.print]is the dpvs. Please print 1st 10 pages from 4.2o1 to check insert.



no parallel id since no change in script or dfa. Just added in insert file.

comment: Hi [~Peter.Dang]

Want to mention one thing here. good amount of missing accounts( missing in originial cycle UFCU_mtg_061622_1.xml ) went to e.sup2.



!image-2022-08-24-09-16-23-215.png!

Hope this will not be an issue. What I am saying here is not all the missing accounts will get mailed. The reason for those account route to e.sup2 is the delivery method. Hope this will not be an issue.
