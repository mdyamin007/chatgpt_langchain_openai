Jun,

I just want to make you that you are aware and available for the 2 following Brisbane Migration date.
11/14, Network team will be move everyones PC over to Brisbane and set them up.
Once they are done, we will need everyone to confirm that they can login.

11/21 is our official migration date. We have a 12 hours window that start from 12 PM PST to 12 AM PST.
This is the date where we will be shutting down Menlo Server and switch over to Brisbane.
Some of the Server like Oracle will need to be ship to Brisbane and setup.
We will need you to be onsite if possible on that day for support.

Please let me know if you have any question or concern.
Here is Brisbanes address in case you dont have it.

Thanks
David
