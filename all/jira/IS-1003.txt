description: SURU - File Footer Addition



The logic is to compare the total counts to make sure the "Total Invoice Count : ######" defined in the data file matches the total number of records we parsed. If not, program will need to exit and send a fatal error email to DP and SURU.





SUBJECT: SURU Electricity Processing Error: Mismatch Counts.

BODY:

Dear Valued Customer,



During processing of the SURU Electricity Statement, InfoIMAGE processed at total of ____ versus the expected "Total Invoice Count : ######" in the data file. Please investigate this issue with InfoIMAGE.
