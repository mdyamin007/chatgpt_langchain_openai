title: FLCU - Letter - DailyPDFi Conversion to AFP2PDF Python [InHse]
description: Update existing processing script to no longer use PDFi tool to create pdf.
 Instead use afp2pdf.py program with index_build_multicore option for ALL statement related apps.
 The smaller daily notice jobs can use the current index_build options.

All the zip file, pgp encryption, index file contents, and PDF file naming convention must remain exactly the same original specifications.

Please ensure the standard SOP on the directory structure must be followed: 
 ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/pdf, ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/zip, ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/work is followed.
 Also, clear the folder directory folder before each processing. We do NOT want to accumulate previous runs.

The current program should support checking total PDF counts verification to make sure the expected pdf matches the total number for pdfs generated; If not, incorporate this standard verification logic

DT_JOB_ID:
 133564-C30.01-V21570

Processing Scripts to modify:
 flcudn_process.sh

Data Files to use:
 FLCU_DN_04302021_01.zip.pgp



*NOTE*: This job runs on RH2 server. Since we are migrating from RH2 server to RHS, please test ALL job_sel options to ensure RHS can run with error messages in the processing log files.

There is dfa FLCUDNA12.dfa you will see , but it is print dfa. So I am not providing .zip file in QA folder for this.

Check/z/dsi_pdfi_testing/flcudna/ old and new folder to compare archival sample.

[^flcudna220.print]print 1st page from 4.2o1.



Thanks

Would you please check again with pdf compare to see the difference to check if the result is better?



Thanks

comment: [~Igor.Khosid]: pdf_compare.pl reported 4 differences. Primary issue with 3 of the 4 differences is the OMR lines are different.

comment: [~rony]: During manual QA when I was doing a pdf_compare.pl training, we manually noticed that the index file structure issue with this job. Left side is original production and right side is new afp2pdf. Please fix index file to make sure the structure matches. Looks like extra line space and the tag is not indented properly and change status to Request for QA when you are done.

Updated sample is in/z/pdf_afp/flcu/flcudna/zip/ folder.

[~William.Kong]

I needed change the template.control indentation like below to generate same structure output which is little bit not friendly coding structure:

!image-2022-07-24-15-37-34-100.png!



If I put the if condition code like this it creates extra empty line before and after TAX ID line:

Thanks

comment: [~rony]: Thanks for the update in fixing the xml file.+Glancing+ the xml file, it looks good, but will need QA team to do a more thorough QA.



Please note. ONLY 1 issue but i'm pretty confident it is a processing issue where the latest run is pulling the date from the insert file. When you ran it originally it was fine. Please confirm if my assessment is correct so that we can make this note to QA:



You original run diff looked OK:

diff_flcu_dn_06202022_048_0_1027.pdf_VS_flcu_dn_06202022_048_0_1024.pdf.ORIG.pdf

But the recent run, the letter date is different:

diff_flcu_dn_06202022_048_0_1027.pdf_VS_flcu_dn_06202022_048_0_1024.pdf.pdf

The following is from PDFi (Original Prod version):

flcu_dn_06202022_048_0_1027.pdf

The following is from your most current version from parallel:

flcu_dn_06202022_048_0_1024.pdf





[~Igor.Khosid]: I've recopied all the pdf and index file from that latest version Rony fixed. I re-ran the pdf_compare.pl for regression testing and the results are good with the exception of 1 which I'm pretty sure is just a processing issue.



The results are in:

ca-isis-pr-04:/d/pdf_compare/result_flcudna/pdf_compare_rpt.txt

Yes the date is coming from the data of processing. Dfa isFLCUDN048.dfa.
