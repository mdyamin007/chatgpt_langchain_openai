comment: Hi [~phoebe.george] [~Ricky Lopez]

Normally we don't use a new index format for tax. All tax still use old one. I also talked to Tun to confirm.


author: JIRAUSER11400
comment: [~Tin.Chak] [~sadiqs] - will theeTax index file for posting remains as is and not be converted to the new version? I'm needing to confirm. Thanks

comment: Hi [~Ricky Lopez]

Would it be possible to discuss this with Peter or Tun?



Thanks

comment: [~rony]: Please address the index file structure with [~TunA]/[~Peter.Dang]; I thought we only have one standard format for eTaxes. If so, we should not deviate or change the process.

comment: Hi [~TunA]

Would it be possible to advise here?

We use the index file in the below format for tax,

ACCTNUM_NOSUFFIX|&FORM_NUM|AFPFILENAME|&STMT_ENDING_DATE|&SUFFIX|ACCT_TYPE|&TAX_SSN_TIN_DATA|ZIP_FILE

And we don't have any new index structure for taxes. right?



[~Ricky Lopez]



Thanks

comment: Hi [~rony],

That's correct. All etax index are still using following index structure. Don't use the new structure.

ACCTNUM_NOSUFFIX|&FORM_NUM|AFPFILENAME|&STMT_ENDING_DATE|&SUFFIX|ACCT_TYPE|&TAX_SSN_TIN_DATA|ZIP_FILE

Thanks,

Tun

As you see from the above discussion we only use one structure for the tax index files. So would you please bring this up with the client?



[~William.Kong]

Thanks


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~rony] The etax index structure is transparent to the client. Is it possible to provide the eTax index file based on what you have so that we can have that posted to pilot ASAP? WHCU is currently in testing.

Thanks!

comment: [~rony]-Client has not yet approved pilot. We are still pending feedback.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~rony] The new live date for this 9/13/22; we are pending final approval on the pilot site.


author: rony
comment: Hi [~phoebe.george]

Do you need anything from me at this point? Did client approve.



Thanks


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~rony]Yes, we have approval on this too. You can move forward with QA request. This code release can be later than monthly/Daily notices because we won't get taxes until EOY.

Thanks!


author: rony
comment: Hi [~phoebe.george]

We didn't do a single code change for this one. I mean for the tax one. So I believe we can close this actually. Since we don't need to release anything for this. Let me know your opinion.



Thanks


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~rony] That is correct, no changes needed for IS side for Taxes since it follows the same index structure. We'll close this out with the rest of the Jira Epic when the job is live. Thanks!

[~Ricky Lopez] FYI

comment: [~rony] Yes, we can close this.

[~Ricky Lopez] Please update this story to cancelled since no IS changes were required on the eTaxes.
