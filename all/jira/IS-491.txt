comment: [~Igor.Khosid] [~gthillaivel] I'll take care of adding the enotice descriptions later today, need to take care of some research regarding to the recent lvl 3 issue first. There might be some index files already, but I will check on that once I've added the descriptions to stage. Will update again near EOD day today.

The enotice index was empty because none of the account matches the xref file, which updated in March 2021 last time. [~barnetts] could you advise if we need to test enotice for the new letter?




author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~Igor.Khosid] [~gthillaivel] The enotice descriptions should be added onto stage now, in case we do receive new data from the client based on Eric's previous comment.

The data print image so the letter body is what the data shows. In your screenshot, the two letters comes from different data files.



The screenshot below shows the data file and the formatted match.
