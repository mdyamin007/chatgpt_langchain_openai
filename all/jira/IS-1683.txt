description: In order to properly capture graphic message count correctly. Variable "img_msg_area"needs to*defined and exported*in control file.



The InfoSync API will store the information in MM_PROCESS_COUNT table. To check the result after processing:



select id, color, msg_box_num, msg_count, criteria_type, msg_area_type from mm_process_count where proc_id=$proc_id



img_msg_area="1" or

img_msg_area="2" or

img_msg_area="1,2"





Programmer Group - Rony (DSI)

sscu -> me3 -> sscume3.control -> SSCUME31.dfa

1. msg count is zero during the infosyn AFI call - missing MSG_AREA1_TYPE output to txt record from the format program
