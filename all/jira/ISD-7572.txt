Hi Matt,

I dropped it off at this path:*/d/SECURE4/FTPRoot/ewbb/client_pickup/*

I also have attached the report here as well if they can't retrieve it.

This file is generated from *Pilot*.

[^ewbb_paperless_accumulative_optout_081022_test.csv]



Let me know if you have any concerns, thanks!

Mac

comment: Hi [~mac]Client is requesting we send it to:

comment: Hi [~mac]Client was able to receive the file via FTP.



However they had the following questions and comments:
 * The report name is *ewbb_paperless_accumulative_optout_*.csv*? Please confirm. Because the file that you sent in July was a different name in a text file{color:#de350b}{color}(paperless_accoptout_202207_20220721140311.txt).{color:#de350b}(GENERATED FROM THE ADMIN SITE){color}

 * We can have the report produced the 2^nd^day of the each month. It looks like that is when our other report generate.

 * Lastly, can you confirm if the borrower choose paper again, the loan will no longer be in the report, correct?

comment: Hi [~mac]Following up on this.

 * Does the the client want it something very similar to "*paperless_accoptout_202207_20220721140311.txt*",becauseI can make it*paperless_accoptout_MMDDYY.txt* as that is the best we can do?
 * Okay, we can set that is the frequency to every 2nd day of each month.
 * The two loan accounts mentioned from the ticket(9211507 and 9131367), are both on paper. The report will generate those that are on paperless.

Hi Igor, can you QA this? It is for staging.

+Steps:+

 # Navigate to DPJS -> Report Schedule -> EWBB
 # Generate a report for*Accumulative Opt Out Report (Paperless)*
 # A file with the name:*paperless_accoptout_MMDDYY.csv* will be generated. (It will be in the log)
 # You can check the file and see if the contents in the file contains data for:*Account Number,Account Type,Status Modified Date,CIF*
