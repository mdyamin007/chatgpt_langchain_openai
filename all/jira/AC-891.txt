title: WECU - [32623][pvt][in-house] eStatement Platform Maintenance
description: If they currently have an Online Banking test site that are pointing to our pilot, then they can go ahead and test it through there. If they don't have it, then we'll need to have someone from our team to provide the login info for Online Banking to setup a test site. Can you create an ISD Jira ticket so we can track any question or issue that they might have later on? I also created an Epic, please link the new Jira ticket to it.
