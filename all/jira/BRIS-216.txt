title: Brisbane Development (Dev, Pilot, Stage) Server Request
description: Kent,

Per our discussion earlier, I have added a new column clone from to the third tab.

Please help clone those one that have the value in this column and leave the rest alone.

Some of these are new request that we dont it yet so I updated the IP column as new.

If you are low on system resource to create some of these new one, please remove the dev one that I highlighted in Yellow so that you can use it for the new one that I am requesting.

Let me know if you have any question.

I have to remove ca-pui-st-01.infoimageinc.com as we had already completed this setup.

Thanks
