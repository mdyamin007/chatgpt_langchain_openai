comment: Thanks [~barnetts]. I just remembered that slcu doesn't have enotice descriptions showing on their sites to begin with, so we can't see the additions I made anyway. Regardless, I've added the descriptions onto pilot and the only thing on ISD's end is to just ensure that the enotices can be posted.

comment: This is technically complete from our end since enotice descriptions don't show on the sites anyway, but I will release the descriptions to production regardless near eod today and I'll provide an update again when it's done.
