description: *ASSESSMENT:*

There are 24 letters in the application. Each letter will be 2hr for both making the minor change and testing. Therefore there will be a total of 48hrs

Total Hrs = 48



There will be 4 developers assigned to this. Each dev to work on 6 letters so each JIRA Story should indicate 12hrs.

DEVS:



Tevis - Letters 1 - 6

Rukmani - Letters 7 - 12

Sam - Letters 13 -18

Jason - Letters 19 - 24



NOTE TO DEVS:

Update your assigned daily letter DFA on the paper option light grey headers from 25% to 50%. Then have Ron test the print samples. If not dark enough, increase a bit more for more testing with Ron. When Ron says it is good, please assign to QA.





*TIMELINE:*

Turnover = 8/15

Sample to QA after Ron says it is good = 8/26

Sample to Client = 8/29

Final QA = 9/1
