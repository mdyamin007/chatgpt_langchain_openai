comment: On Pilot, I had to configure it under Feature Settings. It didn't work even setting it up on InfoConfig.

FYI. The functionality disables the user (setting them to unenrolled and inactive) instead of unlinking the user from the account.

comment: [~mac] the client is asking what happens if there are more than one email address for an account. Does it disable both then if one person wants e do they have to go in and re-sign up for e? We unlinked [jhanley@first-online.com|mailto:jhanley@first-online.com] in pilot and the email addresses (multiple of the same) were removed. is that the correct behavior?

No, it doesn't disable it for both. It should only affect the user that is being unlinked. Yes, the email addresses for the user that is being unlinked will be removed.

comment: [~mac] Per April at FFINN:

I do see that the 2^nd^ email address is not disabled. I think were OK with this being moved to production. Thanks!

Please confirm is it about 'Unlink User and Account' from InfoTrac using Delete icon?

Hi Natasha, that is correct, using the Delete Icon on InfoTRAC to 'Unlink User and Account'.
