comment: Hi [~andyp]- Please note, per William, we will need to enable AOLP via InfoTrac for the first cycle only so the bank can review an approve the first set of samples. Please let me know if you need anything. I'll let ISD know they need to turn on as well.

I also updated the SOW to reflect that we're householding and that account numbers should not be masked.

Note:

This sample was using the following data file.

WEST 2022-03-31 notices of paid and returned items.txt


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~andyp]-"Date of Notice" - Notice is spelled incorrectly. There is an extra "I".It also appears to be misligned.

The check amount is not on the same line as the other data.

comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]

For the check amount on the right column, the line spacing was coming from the data file.

Could you check whether customer can change the line spacing on their end.



*From data [file:|file://%2A/]*

Also for multiple transactions in page 10, program cannot realign the line spacing in this case.

Here is the new sample with increase in font size.

Also accounts which had multiple pages transactions were combined into one page. See page 1 and 26 in the sample.

author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~andyp]- Feedback from CU...

1. Is it possible to make the name/address the same font as the notice verbiage?

2. Need to delete the account number from being listed multiple times on the left hand side.

3. Need to test a notice that goes onto a second page. Account that has about 40 returns. Is there a record in the data with this many returns?

4.Can you please generate the next set of samples with the "Return Service Requested" endorsement and OMR barcodes? Bank needs to see final product.

There was some issue with data file 09/22.
I attached the sample statement that generated from that data.  It was on page 3.
Also I attached the snap shot of that data.

This was a returned notice type.
Since we suppressed the header of subsequent transaction, the amount in that subsequent did not show up.

author: diegof
comment: [~andyp] we need to do something like we did with the paid items while also trimming that first one that contains the header and some data. The client CANNOT "fix" the data so we need to figure out a solution. 

I would say whenever we see "ACCOUNT NBR CHECK NBR AMOUNT" in returned item notice we change it to the two line header. "INSUFFICIENT FUNDS FEE/ CHECK NBR AMOUNT 
ACCOUNT NBR BALANCE AMOUNT INSUFFICIENT" then we have to trim the transaction information that comes in that second header line so we can still display it. With logic like this we can even fix the one page versions of this to read a little better.

author: andyp
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]

I updated program with the following items
1. Adding the missing verbiages
2. Removing the duplicate amount in Returned Item Notice

3. For CHECK NBR column alignment with the column in transaction lines, these info and spacing were coming from data file.  There were different variations in transaction lines that we cannot align them with that above verbiage.  It also may look correct with one statement but it would be different in another statement.

author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: Hi [~andyp]- So the bank pushed back on this request that I know you mentioned is dangerous...

Add headers to 2nd page



The reason they ask this is because they need the account number on the 2nd page just in case the 2 pages are separated. Can you print the account number on the 2nd page? If you can't print as a header, can you put anywhere else?


author: andyp
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]

I can add header lines on subsequent pages.  But there is no guarantee that it will match/align with the transaction lines that overflow under it.

For account number, I can add that line just under the notice date on every pages.  Is it ok?


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~andyp]- Yes, under the date of notice will be fine. Please provide updated samples. Please be sure to include samples from the 6/21 cycle so the client can see 2 page DL's. Thanks.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~andyp]- The PDF archival you uploaded 4 days ago for the 9/22 file is wrong. Bank is saying the first sentence is still missing in PDF's. Please recreate and resend. Please send unencrypted file as well so I can check.

comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]

The sample that I sent on 10/27 for cycle 0/21 did have the update for body message verbiages.
Could ask the bank to review that version.

For cycle 09/22, I will send another set of samples that combines with the recent request on Friday 10/28.
I need some time to work on this recent request. 


author: andyp
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]

I made program update to add header lines on subsequent pages and account number below the date of notice.
The top message in the body section was not changed.  This item was updated previously.
Attached full set of samples from cycle 06/21 which had several 2 pages accounts at the end.

comment: [~andyp]- Bank has a follow up question. They're asking about spacing issues and I'm assuming it's this way in the data. Please confirm.



Returned Item(2) has a space right above the dollar amounts where the Paid Items has no space right above the dollar amounts.

Why the difference?



Returned Item(2) dont have a space between the line and the total of all times where the Paid Items has the space.

Why the difference?

Amount

Space

20.00

For returned item, it is easier to show account 123-10251-1 on page 130 of 09/22 sample.
This account had multiple postcard data.

 !screenshot-3.png|thumbnail! 

Header lines were showed in red
Transaction lines were showed in blue
The extra line spacing were showed in yellow.

This was the data file from that account.




author: andyp
comment: This was the data from that account.
 !screenshot-4.png|thumbnail! 

Program logic was to capture the most relevant header lines which was the last header line.
Then it suppressed the transaction nested inside that header line.
The purpose was program able to display the correct header line at beginning of transaction section and
also display the header lines for subsequent pages if this statement overflow to second page.

The extra line spacing were pulled from data file and were displayed as is.

This logic was applied similarly for Paid Item statement.

Current status: missing lines (https://jira.infoimageinc.com/browse/BT-557) is fixed, I validated it.

Absence of account# and address check when combining documents (https://jira.infoimageinc.com/browse/BT-560)is not fixed in the current build.


author: andyp
comment: [~avannik]
I already add the defensive logic to check for double nesting.
If you edit the account number on subsequent pages then program should catch it.
For account name, it's very tricky to extract account name on subsequent page and it's not feasible at the moment.
If program can catch different account number then I think it's good to prevent double nesting.


author: JIRAUSER11700
comment: [~andyp],I did the following with the newly exported project:

Modified data file to change account # and address in the second document:
!modified_data.png!

Reloaded data to Papyrus:
!output.png|width=852,height=449!
The documents were still combined and there are no messages. I would expect an error message and processing halt.


author: andyp
comment: [~avannik]
Could you reimport project file?
I believe that I had that fix already.
Program would have error messages and it would continue to next document.


author: andyp
comment: [~avannik]
I just make an update to add defensive logic to detect different account name on subsequent pages.
Please reimport project file.


author: JIRAUSER11700
comment: [~andyp]yes, I see error message for account # mismatch now. Message category is 3.

I see no message for the address mismatch.

And, when we talked with Diego, I believe he mentioned we should halt processing (message category 4) as there's a suspicion that the data file is corrupted.
[~diegof] please confirm.


author: andyp
comment: [~avannik]
Please reimport project file.
For exit code, I prefer to have it cat 3 and continue with next document.
In many cases, if there is error due to bad data file, we need to provide snap shot of that bad account to customer to understand what went wrong.  
If we exit out program, we cannot provide that snap shot to understand the root cause.
