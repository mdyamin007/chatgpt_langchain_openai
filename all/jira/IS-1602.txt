title: STAR - [32768][pvt][in-house] DP - STAR DDA EOM - Failed Automation
description: Per our meeting about STAR DDA month end issue, here were the assessment for this program updates.

Partition xml data file and using multi threads to process and join the output dat file.

Using multi threads on the check image parsing to reduce the processing time.

Estimated: 10 hours



TIMELINE:

Turnover = 9/16

Sample to QA = 9/23

Sample to Client = NA

Parallel = 9/26

Live Date = 9/30

Dev = Andy

I found that the issue was the difference in the flattened xml data files after preprocessing step.
The flattened xml data was different in cron mode versus interactive mode.

I made program update in preprocessing xml data file step.  I had tested it in ssh to preprocessing02 in both cron mode and interactive mode.  The flattened xml data files now were the same output.

I also ran full end to EOM 08/31 data file in cron mode.  Everything looked good in parallel.

I made program update to handle this issue.
Also I added bench mark timing for each steps.

Please create MPT for this program update.
We need to test last 2 month end cycles in cron mode.
