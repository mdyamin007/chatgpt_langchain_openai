title: CHCU - [21966][pvt] CHCU / SECU Deconversion Full eStatement archive transfered to hard drive
description: Please follow the Deconversion confluence page for general instructions.

*Deconversion specs:*
* Server: ca-pdfconv-pr-01.infoimageinc.com
* CHCU consists of two cids: CHCU and SECU. Zip files should be placed in their respective folder.
* All statements from Aug 2014 to Aug 2021 should be copied and zipped to the hard drive, the script should already be dropping the zip files off in /mnt/chcu/chcu or /mnt/chcu/secu.
* Upon entering the docker chcu_app_1, we created a chcu and an secu folder in /home/script. Please run the script for chcu in /home/script/chcu and the script for secu in /home/script/secu. All the necessary files should be in the chcu and secu folder.
* Zip folders should be by statement type by month-year, i.e. every month should be a zip for each statement type. Each tax type should also have its own folder.
* CHCU and SECU do not have any enotices.
* These should cover all the statement types between CHCU and SECU: default, visa_plat, heloc, escrow, re_reg, etax types 1,4,16,32,65536. Note: Some of these types may not exist for every month nor for both cids, please double check in the db before running cycles. 
* Should be able to run 2 batches on separate instances, may want to try with smaller batches first (I think running a batch of one year should be fine). 

*Completed (Issues listed further below)*
CHCU: Most of Jan 2020 - Aug 2021. Issues with: March 2020 default
SECU: Most of Jan 2019 - Aug 2021. Issues with: Feb 2019 default

*Please run the remaining years for all statements and research the issues mentioned:*
CHCU: Aug 2014 - Dec 2019
SECU: Aug 2014 - Dec 2018

CHCU: Mar 2020 - Could not pull March 2020 default from the admin site for the following accts: 68443, 80503, 266931

The client is very concerned ab out the time frame. Can you confirm when the first 2TB of data will be ready? Can we deliver this soon?



Also can we start with the most recent statements?

I'm in the process of generating a real sample file, which so far will consist of 1 monthly cycle of heloc as well as all the 2020 etax statements for both chcu and secu. The script is running atm, I think I should have the sample ready by eod today. I'll provide another update at that time or if it's completed sooner.

Once I have the sample generated, my plan is to generate all the 2021 statements first. I will have to use this week to see how much progress we've made so that I can better determine an estimate of how long this would take.

comment: Most recent SECU etax is done, currently running one month of all statement types first, since this will continue running overnight and will most likely take longer than CHCU etax. I'll have to run CHCU etax first thing tomorrow morning after all the other statement types to complete the sample.

comment: Started running 1 month (aug 2021) of all statement types for chcu yesterday around 6pm, I just checked now (~9:15am) and it's still running. Going to monitor this throughout the day.

comment: Sample copied over to their FTP, it does not include CHCU monthly and CHCU 1099-INT due to size related issues.
