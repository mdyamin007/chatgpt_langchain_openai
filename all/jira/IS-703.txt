Yes, we are on schedule for live date 01/05/2021.

Just one question, title says 'STMT/MTG', so is this for both Monthly and Mortgage Statement?

comment: [~MattL]: Can you confirm when we need to do the code rollback? Can we do it on Friday 2/11 or Monday morning after 9am on 2/14. The reason why I'm asking is because the due date is on Sunday 2/13. Please advise [~jira_naru]with the decision.

comment: Hi Guys, we just got a new expected arrival date of 2/18 plan roll back for that day as of now.


author: william.kong
comment: [~MattL]: Just to confirm, if file arrives on 2/18, should we roll code back on Tuesday Feb 22, since Monday 2/21 is a holiday. Please advise so that I can update the date accordingly.'


author: mattl
comment: Roll back for the file that arrives on 18th. So this should be rolled back on the 17th
