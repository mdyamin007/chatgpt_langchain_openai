title: SNFB - [31186][pvt][in-house] Mortgage Stmt. - File Does Not match SOW
description: The info on the SOW for paper does not match what is being printed. This will not meet service level today. Please see attached.

We set up Tray 3(4005) and Tray 4(4000) for combined loan billing statement which is part of the current mortgage app. Please see IS-1024. Might need to update the SOW.



However, I see the page count on the top right is off in the pdf attached on comment #2. I think its a small bug in the code. I can make a quick hotfix for the count, can you please create a jira story?
