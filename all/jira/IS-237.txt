ISD Assessment 
 ============= 
 I checked their backers/disclosures we have on the member site and they already have the address PO Box 7487, Springfield, OR 97475-0487. Unless they want us to edit these, this looks like perhaps a 1 hour resource update. We can match IS timeline.

 - In format programs (SLCUMS11.dfa,SLCUMS13.dfa,SLCUMS19.dfa,SLCUMS28.dfa)
 Add the following sentence under the sentence "We may report information about your account...":
 "Payments, deposits, or any other correspondence should be mailed to PO Box 7487, Springfield, OR 97475."

This is the text in the sample, I think the "any" word is included. Or could you highlight the words that's missing?

Gnana - I can see the verbiage on output and the attached pdf's

"FONT ARIAL_9 BOLDITALIC
'We may report information about your account to credit bureaus. Late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report. *Payments, deposits, or any other correspondence should be mailed to PO Box 7487, Springfield, OR 97475*.' "

Since the change is verbiage only and no resource is updated, we don't need a parallel.

The code is good to release, let me know when I should release it.
