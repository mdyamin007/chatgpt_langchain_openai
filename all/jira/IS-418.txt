comment: Hi [~kericapote],

I cannot assign this Story because we don't havedeliverables for this project (like, latest PDF data file, file naming convention, etc.).

The timeline will depend on those information.

Thanks,

Tun

the text of the body is hardcoded

!Capture2.JPG|thumbnail!

as the data is in pdf and converting pdf to text produces some garbage characters.

here is the pdf sample attached for review.

comment: Hi [~Peter.Dang] [~kericapote]

I need the password to access WALZ server for TFCU. You can provide me the pass in the ac-secures-share folder.

Also, [~kericapote]can the client provide us a file with multiple accounts? I want to test the logic of customer separation in our code.



Thanks

comment: Hi [~kericapote]

Just to let you know there are no archival specs defined in the sow except the just archival zip file name. So archival will be added later?

comment: Hi [~yameelee]

Need help to release this.

[^IS_PROGRAM_TRANSFER_FORM_Rev 07132016.doc]

There is a change in isisdisk_daily.sh to include thetfcu_cert_mail.sh.

[~Peter.Dang] [~kericapote]

Need help to set*tfcu_cert_mail_counter.txt*in /home/keep/ with one initial entry

format is :

!image-2022-11-01-05-14-15-915.png!





in/home/test/keep/tfcu_cert_mail_counter.txt I set the 1st entry as

4000,0,0,10/10/2022 09:30,tfcudnc,0

I believe we just need to change the 1st column env stock available, and the time stamp.



Thanks
