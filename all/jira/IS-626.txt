Could you please issue the ticket for parallel?

The live date needs to remain the same. We've agreed to this live date twice now.



Parallel 24941 created.


author: william.kong
comment: [~Kbittmann]: Can you please clarify you comment above "Thelive date needs to remain the same."? I noticed Rukmani's original due date documented in the story was 12/17 which did not match the timeline documented in the description of work so I fixed it to 12/23.

Please clarify "remain the same" 12/23 or 12/17. For now, I'm leaving the due date of 12/23 untouched based on what is written in the description of work above.



Unfortunately, I don't see documentation in this discussing what was agreed "twice now".



[~Peter.Dang]/[~rukmaniR]: FYI. Please ensure we get good clarification on the timeline.
