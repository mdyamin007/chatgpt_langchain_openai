title: 7118 /  41764 - FCSB - eTax Email Handler
description: Using FcsbEmailHandler for estmt/enotice as a base, please develop FcsbEtaxEmailHandler.

This handler is for both FNBT and FHNB (known together as FCSB). Currently, they are set up to use EtaxEmailHandler2 which is for Contact_Info. FCSB has moved to Notification Preference and they have Restrictions.

Hi Abdullah,

How are you doing on this project?

comment: hi [~tai.trinh],
Joe suggested looking for a solution without creating a stand-alone etax Email handler for FCSB, I'm still analysis existing code support for that.
If we go for stand-alone I have analyzed the *FcsbEmailHandler*estmt for restrictions, I have figured out a solution for that but I didn't code that. Joe mentioned we have some time to look for another solution so I'm still analyzing code.

Hi Abdullah,

Please resume work on this ticket. Did you ever figure out a way to do this without creating a new Handler? If not, I think it is fine to proceed with a new FcsbEtaxHandler.

Thanks,
Tai

Please provide a requirement document as joe mention i will start working once i have that, we have to go with the new handler for FCSB.
one more thing I need clarification about is *restriction*, I have seen they have 2 types of restrictions
 # *np_id*
 # *email*

Which of these two restrictions will be used or both? And also can you let me know that from where these restrictions are interested? Because I have seen some np_id in restrictions table which don't exist in the notification table.

Document is now attached. 

Restriction about email is outdated. Only np_id matter. The ones where np_id DNE are because the restriction table is not being cleared out properly when an NP record is deleted. Do not worry about them.
