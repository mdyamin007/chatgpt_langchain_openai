Attached PDF to update the logic. This is mainly to not display the starting balance line that has no amount shown.

sorry for the late update, can you update the code to skipping account and warning message with account number when there is a mismatch with the product list. the process should continue though.

lets put this message in the log.

ERROR: <ACCT_NUM> PRODUCT MISMATCH. PLEASE CONTACT IS.

i will add this to the SOW.

If we add that message I think the log will have a lot of this error message for every cycle since the data file contain data file for 4 apps. What will happen if we get the error message for all the apps every month? I don't quite understand the need for this error message since it's most likely the error message will occur every process for every app.

The error message is added to the DFA.
