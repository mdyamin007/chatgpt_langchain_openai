title: ALCU - [22744][pvt] Update New Excite Logo on Daily Notices
description: -------------------per Peter----------------------------

I found out the loan program is printing the log directly on. No need to have Wilson make create e-form. It is strange that the program is using e-form and also print the logo as well.

Loan applications:

Consumer Loan Statements (ML1),

LOC Loan Statements (ML2),

Mortgage Loan Statements (ML3) - 6 hours

Daily Notice: 3 hours.



Turnover to IS: 10/4/2021

Sample to client: 10/12/2021

Client approval: 10/14/2021

QA: 10/18/2021

Parallel: 10/20/2021

Live: 10/22/2021

For the DT Job ID do you need that for Pilot, Staging, or Production? And is there a specific cycle you need it for?

comment: Hi [~jharvey]

For pilot and staging. Don't need to worry about cycle.

Would you please ask isd to post this in pilot *dla_20210326_1_20211018_0738_alcu.txt* and after that client can review the enotice sample. No need to provide any other resources as this logo was same as alcu monthly update which is already in production.

Please reexport all dfa's with the latest logo update into QA folder, the output displays an old logo.

comment: Hi [~berezinez]

Actually, I only exported ALCUDL001.zip in qa folder and also asked to import only that project . But there were also other daily projects there which might make you confused. I removed all those. There are only ALCUDL001.zip now. Please only export this project. It will import all updated dfas.



If it doesn't work ping me on skype.



Thanks,

Rony
