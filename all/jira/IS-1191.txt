title: MFCU - [29788][pvt] Remove the Number for Promos on the Credit Card Statements
description: Dev Hour: 2

Turnover Date: 06/27/22

Sample Date: 06/28/22

Approval Date: 06/30/22

Live Date: 07/01/2022



Details:

---------------

dfa : mfcucc1

Remove number after Promo and make it singular ( remove 's' for only promo entry), check comment 1,3,4.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On the credit card statements there is a section towards the end for Interest Charge Calculations. In that box/section is where we break down the different promos for the loan. Currently the promo is displaying with the number. See example below. The *number of the promos should be removed*. See red highlight. Going forward it should only say *Purchase Promo*, *Balance Transfer Promo*and *Cash Advance Promo*. Also, the "s" make those phrases plural should be removed.

Only for the ones with "Promo". The regular "Purchases", "Cash Advances" and "Balances Transfers" stay plural.

These are correct :

"Purchases Promo 8" > "Purchase Promo"

"Balances Transfers Promo 8" > "Balance Transfer Promo"

And so forth because there can be a total 21 of those combos. If a "Promo" is put at the end it should NOT have an "s".

comment: [~sadiqs], please see following question from MFCU:

"When you tested did you use theCCPROMOTERMDATES file? One of the things we notices is the Good Through Dates aren't displaying. We want to make sure that functionality is not being lost as it is a must have. Thank you."



Thanks,
Daphne

We didn't change anything about dates. And yes we usedCCPROMOTERMDATES file but some how it didn't generate promo dates for all customers that we used to provide samples. So we gurranty that no existing functionality is changed/removed.

comment: Hi [~sadiqs], please see following from MFCU:

"I am proofing one of my test accounts in the test run we just did in pilot. I do not see the changes we made there. See below the "Promo 7" is still showing. That should just say "Purchase Promo" and "Balance Transfer Promo" per our changes.
