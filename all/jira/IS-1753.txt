comment: As far as I can see, the script modification does what is intended: copy afp file to/d/pdf_afp/gocu/gocuvs1/afp/, then run conversion to pdf from the new location.

QA passed

comment: [~infoimage]Salman, I cannot run the script. Could you please run it and attach the output here?

All I can do is make a diff, but this time I can't see what is its point:

!diff.png!

it looks to me that you are back to running the conversion from the old directory (where it did not work?)

comment: Hi [~avannik] 

 Please try again with the following parallel ID.
I went ahead and ran the script and it seems to be working fine now.

Thanks.

comment: Hi [~TunA]

The issue was while calling afp2pdf we are calling it for afp which was in the working directory/d/gocu/gocuvs11218.afp instead of /d/pdf_afp/gocu/gocuvs1/ directory. Since the working directory is not shared folder with preprocessing02 ( where the actual afp 2 pdf conversion happens ) it was giving errors, which was reported in ts [https://app.na3.teamsupport.com/?TicketNumber=34765.]Then we worked on updating it but unfortunately, we didn't fully update it. Check the below diff :

!image-2022-10-31-13-38-51-358.png|width=1332,height=489!

The right is the current production code that you released upon our request. As you see on the right side it is still using e_opt_afp_file which is still from /d/gocu/ folder. Although we created a new variablee_opt_afp_file_conventional which points to /d/pdf_afp/gocu/gocuvs1/ but we didn't use it while calling afp2pdf.

Unfortunately, this is something that didn't raise the issue in parallel due to /z being shared through all servers.

I already ran in parallel and the afp used for afp2pdf call is from pdf_afp folder now.

Would you please release this once more? Transfer for is same as previous.[^IS-1753_Transfer-Form-1.docx]
