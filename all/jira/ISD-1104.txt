Hi [~phoebe.george]

Can you provide us the SOW or any other featured documentation for this client?

Thanks,

Adding a copy of the SOW, but this is just a description of the work being done. The main attachments have been included on the ticket with the personalization options that are attached already/screenshots. Please let me know what additional information is needed to continue to update the site.

Did you guys take a look at the attachments? Seem like those weren't taken into consideration for the responsive redesign. The responsiveness is fine, but client's desired personalization is not in place. The UI will be Hypercube-like. 

I have reformat the files and put them in the FCSB.zip. Please download, unzip, review, and do the needed additional work for this project.

Files:
*Client's UI Template:* This is the client's mock-up of how the ui and color scheme should be. We should try to adhere to this if possible.

*Personalization Template*: This is the personalization template we provided to the client. In here each area / feature have a number. The client's response are in the Client Personalization's Response file. The responses are matched by number, e.g. reponse #1 match with feature / personalization # 1 in this file.

*Client Personalization's Response*: This is the client's responses to our personalization options.

*fhnb_logo*: This will be the new logo for fhnb.

*fnbt_logo*: This will be the new logo for fnbt.

*fhnb_sample_statement*: This will be the new sample statement during sso enrollment for fhnb.

*fnbt_sample_statement*: This will be the new sample statement during sso enrollment for fnbt.





Thanks,
Tai

Here I need feedback on the following scenario for both FNBT and FHNB. These scenarios exist on non-responsive sites also.

1.In edit authorized viewer page verbiage says All fields are required. But only red fields are required. Should the verbiage be changed to All {color:#FF0000}Red{color} fields are required?

!Edit authorized viewer.png!



2.In the assign viewer page although there is no viewer to assign a submit button is shown but it has no functionality. Should it be removed?

!Assign viewer.png!



3.In enrollment step 2 if a user click on the disagree button and then go back using browsers back button then it shows Enrollment- step 1 of 5. Is this behaviour okay?

1. Yes, please add "red" to the verbiage.
2. Yes, please have the "Submit" button visibility be conditioned on whether there are actually authorized users to assign.
3. When I try, if I click Disagree, my tab / window closes out almost immediately. It would be very difficult for me to use the browser's back functionality. However, seems like it is reading it as if the user is now going through DSO enrollment which have 5 steps. Please look into resolving. It should be Step 1 out of 3. If you continue with this Step 1 out of 5, does it goes to Step 2 out of 3 Disclosure, or does it continue with 2 out of 5?

I noticed that there are unusual empty space below the FNBT logos for larger-sized windows.

FHNB experience a similar issue when the window is of a certain size.

After clicking the disagree button if I continue with this Step 1 out of 5 it continues with 2 out of 5 instead of 2 out of 3.

We will fix this with the stateless version of FHNB and FNBT responsive site.

For FNBT, I am getting this error. The UI results in a SESS TIMEOUT. 

13:41:38.299 [ajp-bio-8609-exec-6] INFO  com.infoimage.web.filter.FNBTFilter - Filter :: doFilter(); uri=/enroll/index.jsp url=https://fnbtpilot.infoimageinc.com/enroll/index.jsp

I am unsure how it is pulling the Wed Dec 31 date. Is it still using cookies? We should not be using cookies if we are going stateless. Furthermore, if I generate the key using Chrome, and then try to do the exchange using Internet Explorer, it cannot be done, which is against what stateless should accomplish. 

For, FHNB, I cannot generate the key. For both FNBT and FHNB, can you also lay out what is necessary to generate the Key and what is necessary to do the Exchange?

There's another UI issue. I think after the "fix" for the SSO enrollment, now the DSO enrollment steps are wrong. It goes "Step 1 of 5", "Step 2 of 5", then "Step 1 of 3", "Step 2 of 3" and "Step 3 of 3", which shouldn't be happening.

Thanks,
Tai

Sorry, disregard what I say about cookies. I misunderstood what stateless is supposed to be. However, I still cannot SSO in through Pilot. Please fix / let me know what I need to do in order to be able to SSO in successfully both through diSSO and sso7. 


author: tai.trinh
comment: @dsi

I was able to log in via SSO7. But no matter which cif_num I use. I always get the same 5 account numbers from the first CIF I use. This implies that the cookie is not being overwritten properly.

Hi [~tai.trinh],

We have fixed some of the issues. Most of them are occurring because of cookie mismatch. I am personally looking into it.

Can you tell for which login type you are not able to generate the key? Because we didn't get any issue while generating key.

My suggestion would be if this is very urgent for the client to test, then you can deploy *dsi-redesign*in pilot as that version is responsive and tested, besides stateless won't bring any noticeable changes on the front end, so end users won't notice any difference. *dsi-redesign-stateless*contains stateless part, but as stateless is having some troubles, I would suggest to deploy *dsi-redesign*based on urgency level. We have a holiday tomorrow, so we won't be able to work on the recent issues.

Let me know what you think.

Hi [~mamunur.rashid],

No, it shouldn't be like that. Please update optout.jsp to provide the fields without the 0 instead.

 # Can we remove the "exit" option? It doesn't make sense due to being SSO'd within an OLB session
 # Your Account Is Closed message - the sentence ends "...and you can no longer access to it". "to" needs to be removed.

*1.* In the official website of bootstrap, it is mentioned that bootstrap is supported only in IE-10 and IE-11. Our QA found that responsiveness is also working fine in IE-9. The problem you mentioned is found only in IE version less than 9. We are still looking into that. Let me know if you will support IE version less than 9.

*2.* I have removed the exit option.

*3.* I changed the verbiage for closed account.

*4.* Previously there was no such confirmation messages/notification in profile page when it saves changed data. I have implemented a new one. But I am not sure about the verbiage of that message/notification. Also, I need to know the time interval for that notification to fade in and fade out. I am using 10 seconds currently. Let me know your feedback on the message verbiage and time interval. I have already deployed code in pilot for your review. Here is a screenshot:

Hi [~mamunur.rashid],

For the IE issue, the client is saying they are using IE 11 on Windows 10. Could you try and reproduce the error by tinkering with the various settings of IE 11?

I haven't been able to reproduce it.

Hi [~tai.trinh]

You said it's causing forFIS SSO, can you tell us which sso method you were referring to by FIS SSO? Because in FCSB, we have sso7 and DI SSO, that's why we are not sure which sso methodFIS SSO is.

Hi[~tai.trinh],

*1.* We couldn't reproduce IE 11 issue in windows 10.

*2.*I found that in pending/commit.jsp there is a line like :
{code:java}
aLog.log("restriction", UFAS[k].getUserId(), UFAS[k].getAccountId(), loginSession.getUserProfile().getUserId(), "insert", "", npId);{code}
Here, "restriction" is inserted into the column 'EVENT' of 'AUDIT_LOG_FHNB' table. 'EVENT' column's size is 10 characters at most. But here "restriction" string has 11 characters. So it is producing a bug. I have changed "restriction" to "restrict".

Code has been deployed on pilot for both FHNB and FNBT.

Thanks.

Hi [~mamunur.rashid]

FIS is sso7. It shouldn't matter which method though, since both access the same pages after login anyway. I will tell the client we can't reproduce the error for now.

The audit log change is good.



Thank you,

There is a difference between link colors in FNBT and FHNB.

!image-2020-04-01-09-50-27-851.png!

I think the lighter pastel color (for FNBT) is better as the default link color. For FHNB, there seems to be a background / highlight that should not be there. Also, when a link is clicked, we should change the color (to a pastel purple) to denote that it has been clicked on. That is standard UX we shouldn't stray from (unless there's a reason why we're not doing that).

Here client mentioned that link color should be #003772 and background should be #ededed. That's why I implemented it like that. Will it be the same as mentioned in this picture or should I change it like the default behavior of HTML link?



author: tai.trinh
comment: @dsi

Hi [~mamunur.rashid],

The background spec, I think, is only for when the links are contained in their own div (like a button). Otherwise I don't think they should take their background from the parent div. Let's put all the links into their own boxes (just like the Digital Services Terms and Conditions button). Update FNBT colors to match FHNB too.

For FNBT, the client is saying the below is what they see when using Chrome. Please look into why this is happening. I think it may be a cache issue, so I have told them to clear cache.

!image-2020-04-02-10-55-35-882.png!



For FHNB, there was a typo forOnline_Services_Terms_And_Conditions.pdf in list_inc.jspf for statements, etax, and enotice. I have fixed this is trunk. Please update the stateless branch also. I notice that the side box with the Terms and Conditions have its own code in each of the list_inc.jspf. It should be the same for statements, etax, and enotice. We should have one jspf file for the code of this box and have the list_inc include the jspf file instead (so we would only have to edit one area of code rather than 3 different areas for the same thing). Unless there's a reason why this can't be done.

Hi [~tai.trinh],

1. I have put all the links into a box in which background color is #ededed and color is #003772 as mentioned in the SOW. Is it okay?

!fhnb_link_style.png!

2. For FHNB 'Online_Services_Terms_and_Conditions.pdf' link was provided in SOW. I just copied it from SOW and put that link into that button. Thank you for changing the code.

3. In statements, etax, enotice there was redundant code because the verbiages are not same in those pages. However I removed some redundant code and added them into two jspf file, 'include/links.jspf' and 'include/termsAndConditionLink.jspf'.

 # I have made further changes on FNBT. Please make the same changes with FHNB. The verbiage is generic enough so that it can be used for FHNB, too. The reason why I remove the contact info is because it is redundant. The user can click on the "Contact Us" button we provided.

Hi [~tai.trinh],

I have taken all the changes you made in FNBT to FHNB. I found that in define.jsp you have added a new method called getArchivalString. In that method, you have divided the archival by 24 for extracting year. Should it be 24 or 12?

I am getting 84 months as 3 years and 12 months. Is it okay?

Hi [~mamunur.rashid],

I noticed that the email address text field on in profile.jsp uses size="50" instead of maxLength="50". This causes the text field to have a scrollbar when the text field is by default scrollable. I have made this change. Can you help me check if there are any other instances where size is used instead of maxLength?

Also for email address, maxLength should be 100 (database support VARCHAR 100), so I think we should use maxLength=100 instead of maxLength=50. Please also update any instance of email address field that define maxLength=50 instead of 100.

Thanks,

Tai


author: tai.trinh
comment: @dsi

Also, there's a chance that the client might want to disable the scrollbars (make it invisible) for when the email is long. I have researched and defined a "disable-scrollbars" class in style.css. Please confirm whether this is the correct way to go about it, or if there's a better way.

Right now, we're not using it yet, but we might.

Thanks,

Tai

Hi[~tai.trinh],



Maybe mistakenly the link ofOnline_Services_Terms_And_Conditions.pdf of FNBT was put into the "Digital Banking Terms and Conditions" button of FHNB. I fixed it.

I have removed all the code that was making Email field overflow scrolling. Now all the emails are into text field and it will follow the default scrolling behavior of text input field.

However, both FHNB and FNBT doesn't update email from profile page. But now emails are in text input field. So, should the input filed be readonly?

I have deployed code on pilot. You can have a look.

Thanks

The code should be that the email is editable by Commercial user (N) and not editable by Personal user (P). This logic should already be in place.


author: tai.trinh
comment: @dsi

Uneditable email field should still be using scrolling. I checked and this seems to be the behavior. You didn't change anything regarding this right?

comment: Mamunur Rashid made the following comment in DSI-124

@isd

Hi [~tai.trinh],

For you kind information, Email validation for FHNB in define page is like below:
{code:java}
private boolean isEmailValid(String s) {
    if (s == null) return false;
    if ("".equals(s)) return false;

    // max email length is 50
    if (s.length() > 50) return false;
    return java.util.regex.Pattern.matches("^[a-zA-Z0-9][\\w\\.-]*@[a-zA-Z0-9][\\w\\.-]*\\.[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z\\.]*[a-zA-Z]$", s);
}
{code}
So if email length is greater than 50 then the email will not be valid. FHNB updates email address only through enrollment. So, will it be a problem if email input field's maxlength is equal to 100?

I added bootsrap class "form-control" to editable email input field in profile page. So there will not be a scrollbar in editable email field.
