What's the status on this project? When do you think you can complete the code and finish testing?

The client is escalating.

comment: Hi Tai,

I have done the code on profile page and now working on enrollment page. I have attached an screenshot. I made it configurable oh how many accounts will be shown in every click or first render. But default is 20 accounts. This user have 419 accounts

Is what I'm seeing with the + signs the account_owner_name? I don't remember that being displayed for EWBB SSO sites. 

It's also a bit clunky how some dropdown takes up two lines while others may take up 1 line. If possible, please have them be listed out one per line like how it currently is. I also don't think we need to add the account: dda and the account name as that is not how it's currently is for EWBB.

Also, do you think you will be able to get everything done by the end of Thursday? 

I need to provide the client with a timeline.

EWBB is using Prism. Their code is in estmt2/ewbb.

comment: While searching an account in profile page , and enrollment step I observed some behavior where i need some feedback.

1) User can search typing account number. ( this is working fine)

2) Search is working for masked account too, for an example in BANB, account number is shown, *****1176 , where the actual account number is190001776. Now if user search for number 19 , this account*****1176 will be shown too in search result. as it is searching through masked account number.  {color:#0747a6}Need feedback .{color}*

3) User can not search by account type and account description. - *{color:#0747a6}Need feedback.{color}*

4) If search result is ore than 20 : Pagination will not work on search results. - *{color:#0747a6}Need feedback.{color}*
