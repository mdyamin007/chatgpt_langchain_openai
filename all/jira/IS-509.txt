Thanks,

comment: [~tanmay] [~rony] Due to color print testing, we had to update the color logo and PDF color doc; attached here and to the mail Epic.

Can you provide an updated set of samples when ready?

I will update the due date to 11/30, but can confirm with IS once you review the new logo.

comment: [~tanmay] Please use this new logo with the color update. Also please email me, Andy Pham, and Jason Van Bladel once this logo has been updated so that they can also test their applications as the original is being held by you in parallel.



Please rename the new resource from S1CTFCSS-1.300 to S1CTFCSS.300 as I can't delete the original resource.

Thanks

comment: Hi [~phoebe.george] 
 Sample (ctfc_sample_11162021.zip) has been attached with updated logo.
 [~yameelee]we had to resize the pseg as given one little bit bigger, we used tiff the [~phoebe.george]send us.
 Update pseg has been attached(S1CTFCSS-2.300) and also placed at parallel.
 Thanks

comment: [~tanmay] The samples with the logo are approved. Can you move forward with generating a DPVS for print samples? However, please use this production file instead for the new test - the print samples will be shipped to the client, and the PDF samples used PLBA data, and we want to use the CTFC data instead - i know this won't generate all the letter versions, but the print samples will be for color printing samples mainly:

Thank you,

comment: [~phoebe.george] Logo resource should be updated now.


author: tanmay
comment: [~phoebe.george]any update on it?


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~tanmay] Sorry for the my late response - the printed logo STILL has issues with the color matching. When the IS program converts to CMYK, it threw off the color once again when OPS printed. Please keep this on hold for now until we can resolve.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~tanmay] Here is the updated logo for the daily notice update as well. Please update and provide a DPVS when possible.

Note that I will update the live date to 4/22/22 for now, but I will confirm with IS/QA to confirm if this date is okay. Thank you!
