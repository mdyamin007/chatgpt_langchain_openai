title: SSCU - [31776][pvt] eSite Document Type Verbiage Update
description: SSCU - eSite Document Type Verbiage Update
*App*: eSite
*Description:* SSCU wants to update the verbiage on their eSite. For the current eSite the document type verbiage needs to be updated to the below.

Document verbiage update: Before > After

Member > Account
Visa Credit Card > Credit Card
Home Equity > Home Equity
Loan Statement > Loan
Screenshot of current verbiage on eSite
Details: Update tab names on member site.Update tab names on admin site (this should also update email template names). This would require code updates and server restarts since their member and admin sites are still on prism/older application. Based on that, here are the hours and tentative timeline below:

Note: The email template names would also change, therefore just an fyi the client may want to update the subject lines accordingly to match. For example they want the 'Visa Credit Card' app to change to 'Credit Card' but their credit card email template has 'Your SAFE Visa eStatement is now available' as the subject.

*Timeline:*
* Hours: 2
* Tentative turnover: 9/16
* Pilot: 9/21
* Client Approval: 9/26
* QA: 9/28
* Live: 9/28
* Parallel: No

Can you please on SSCU question?

Per SSCU,
I was able to validate Account and Credit Card, but there aren't any Loan or Home Equities/HELOC uploaded in Pilot to validate.
Can you please provide accounts for us to validate those with?

Thanks, Barnett

Our QA has tested with this account number:100198085.

This Account has all the statement types but there might be a mismatch in the pdf doc which is not part of this testing.
