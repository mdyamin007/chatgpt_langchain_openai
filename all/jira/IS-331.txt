comment: Per email response, resource is uploaded and index file dla_20210830_1_20210902_1635_acbk.txt has been posted onto stage. Checked one of the accts with letter 033 and backer image looks good.

comment: Leo-Can you request print samples


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~gthillaivel], there are two index files to check on stage, one for enotice 032 and one for 033:

dla_20210830_1_20210902_1635_acbk.txt: letter 033 - acct 68984
dla_20210122_1_20210914_1454_acbk.txt: letter 032 - acct 7109652
*Note*: Since this is an older enotice file, I had to manually change the enotice date to something more recent within the archival period, so it is expected that the date link does not match the date on the notice itself.
