title: CAMB prism analysis for Hypercube  
description: Can you guys help do a quick assessment of CAMB's code. We're setting a child CID for them and we're trying to make a decision if 1) we want to move them to hypercube, 2) we want to update their back-end to use NP only, or 3) just keep their site as is. Please do an assessment of the code and provide a recommendation to me by tomorrow if possible. If not, I just need to know by tomorrow how much more time you guys will need.
