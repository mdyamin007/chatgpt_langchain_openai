title: SANA: Change Check Number Text Color to Black
description: Permanent update to change check numbers on statements from blue to black as we had to remove the check image hyperlink from the PDF document for electronic posting.


Programming hour: 1hr

Turnover date: 10/24/2022

Sample Date: 10/27/2022

Sample Approval date: 10/28/2022

Live Date: 11/01/2022

Assessment: ISD disabled the view check link tied to the PDF eStatement so it is no longer a hyperlink. However, with removing the hyperlink on the PDF eStatement the check font is still the blue color. Remove the blue color from SANADS11.dfa.

QA needs to verify the posting on Stage:

Stage posting forIndex fileds1_check_10242022_10272022_0404_sana.txt

acc# 84904156check# 1148

is still showing the check number in blue color.

[~Ethan.Yu] Let me know when I can verify it, and the Stage posting is ready for QA.

Please provide a new Index file if needed.

comment: [~Ethan.Yu] We were able to resolve the issue tied to the IS/QA side for viewing on Staging. This has been released on the IS side for production and is good now. You can close out as done. Thanks!
