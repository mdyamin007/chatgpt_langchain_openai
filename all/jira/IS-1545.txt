SSCU has requested that the footer date be updated from 8/18/2022 to : 9/28/2022

 The footer on page 1 of each statement is updated from 8/18/2022 to 9/28/2022. If they want to update the footers on the disclosures, they will need to provide new disclosures with the new date.
 The updated sample is attached:[^sscudl108_updated_sample.pdf]

Can you confirm all the pages should be updated from  8/18/2022 to 9/28/2022. Currently the update is made only in the first page "8/18/2022". Consecutive pages have the old date displayed as"8/18/2022"
