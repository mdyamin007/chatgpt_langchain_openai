title: ca-preproc-pr-02:  Unit Testing - Papyrus Image Converter [psel3pic]
description: *Summary*:

On 2/27/2020, Will K. was able to convert a tiff file to pseg+once.+ However, thorough testing was not done. Attached was the+single+ test case used for testing and the resulting pseg file:

sffcu.tif

my_fs10.icd

Here's the command I used to generate the sffcu.300 result:

/isis/psel3710/pic/psel3pic /profile=my_fs10.icd





*Server IP:*

ca-preproc-pr-02.infoimageinc.com



*Specifications*:
 * Review the scripts that uses the psel3pic command and see if the script needs to be updated. The brisbane ca-preproc-pr-02 server path is different than current preprocessing02 server:
 ** /isis/psel3710/pic/psel3pic vs/isis/psel3700/pic/psel3pic
 ** 
 * Convert several tiffs to pseg
 * Confirm file size is equal or less; Please use old preprocessing02 to compare with this new preprocessing02 server to test.
 * Verify all modes are convertible; e.g. fs10, fs45, etc etc.
 * Verify both black & white or color tifs work.
 * Benchmark testing (if needed; check with manager if this task needs to perform for this project)

comment: I was able to confirm "manually" that the image converter was able to manually convert the pseg back in early March.
