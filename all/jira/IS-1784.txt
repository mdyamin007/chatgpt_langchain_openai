Per comment 9 in ts [https://app.na3.teamsupport.com/?TicketNumber=35430], we need tiff image of signature to make the signature clear.

Thanks

Per Wilson "IS will have to type out the names if they want it to be more clear" I've attached the TIF provided by Wilson. I don't think it looks as clear as the screen shot provided.
