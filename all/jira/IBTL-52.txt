title: /home/control/daily.control:  Add Logic to handle both IPAS Server in Menlo & Brisbane
description: 

Based on the issue https://jira.infoimageinc.com/browse/IBTL-32

Ernest's resolution to make it work was to update the /home/control/daily.control file to update the IPAS numeric IP address to use10.4.20.27 instead of Menlo IPAS10.8.9.72.



Unfortunately, we can not use hostname and must use a hardcoded numeric IP address. IPAS Papyrus requires IP address.



Because we need to sync /home/control between Menlo and Brisbane, we need to add logic to support both facility:

I would like us to modify the control file to add another if condition to check if the $HOST_IP begins with '10.8.9', if so assign ip='10.8.9.72' ; else use 10.4.20.27.



Would like this to be deployed no later than Tuesday, Aug 25 and inform DP and IS when code is released to production.

comment: [~rodriguez] and [~Peter.Dang]:  Spoke with Peter today and he would like Leo to work on this. Please update the logic and release as early as Monday.



[~Peter.Dang]: As discussed, please ensure we test this properly on Monday via Menlo Server in parallel environment on RH2. We can use the same program reported by Leo in ticket IBTL-32 to verify it is working and does NOT have Watermark Output. Once released, please email IS & DP that we made a change to /home/control/daily.control.

comment: [~William.Kong]: I see that $HOST_IP is assigned only the first 2 fields of the delimiter cut. Is it ok to switch the logic to: "check if the $HOST_IP begins with '10.8', if so assign ip='10.8.9.72' ; else use 10.4.20.27."

Please look toward line 180 in /home/control/daily.control area. In your comment above, you are look at the top of the daily.control file. It's actual near the bottom near line 180 is.

comment: [~rodriguez]: No worries. It's good that you ask. I prefer that. Good luck on the code edits later this week.



[~Peter.Dang]: i will have to hold off on my plans with code sync from Menlo to Brisbane until this is updated.

comment: [~William.Kong] code has been released. Same job from IBTL-32 was tested on Menlo RH2 parallel. Everything looks good. No watermarks on afp files. DPVS counts matched production.

comment: [~rodriguez]: The IP address is not correct for Brisbane IP server. Please use 10.4.20.27 instead of 10.4.20.7. Please also update comment to state Brisbane instead of "Brisbane IPAS Server"

Please work with Peter on this first thing Thursday morning.  Please re-assign back to me when it is done. I will move it to the "Done" status if I verified that it was done so that I can double-check.
