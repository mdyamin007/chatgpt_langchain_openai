Comment #20

Regarding the logo in the top left, this needs to be placed by InfoImage to fit the return address window of the envelope. When we originally setup our other letters, we did tap testing, etc. to be sure it fit properly. If the envelopes will be the same, then the placement should be fine, but we'll want to see some samples before mailing.

Comment #7:

The key data points (Loan #, Address, Etc.) will not change or move, however there may be small edits to the body of the letter. Hopefully this is enough to get your team started on a quote and timeline for this project. Also, after speaking with my supervisor, it sounds like it would be preferred if we could send this as a pre-merged PDF file, rather than an Excel data file with Word template to merge it with. Let me know if that will work. As a reminder, there will be somewhere between 3,000 & 4,000 letters and they will all be mailed with a return envelope, and*not*posted online for clients, however, we would like the ability to search for them by account number in InfoTrac.

Comment #12:

A sample file is attached (only 100 pages, the actual file will be much larger). Keep in mind that the body of the letter may change slightly, specifically the last line that is just placeholder text for right now. The data points at the top, including the account number and address block are fixed, and will not change. If it helps with file size, I could remove our logo, and have InfoImage place it back on during processing. Let me know if you or your team has any questions.

Per client:

Well, that's a bummer. We certainly can't delay our timeline by a month, so I've attached a sample data file. Let me know if your team has any issues with it. Once you're able to generate some sample letters, I can have all the necessary people here approve them, or make recommendations for any changes. I'm assuming that we'll get to see samples of the letter as it is printed on the specialty stationary that we chose? Possibly in both directions on the paper? And will we also get to see a letter as it shows through the envelope window? And the return envelope window?


author: bryanl
comment: Hi [~rony]

Also per client:

Thanks! I also have another question since we're doing this differently than I had thought. I was under the impression that we would be able to make these changes on our end before print, but since you'll be merging the file, I don' t think that's the case. The text at the bottom of the letter needs to be updated with the changes outlined below. Can this happen? Feel free to call me if you have questions.

comment: Hi [~rony]

Per client:

Hello Bryan, the changes we'd like to see are outlined below, and also in the attached PDF. Please let me know if you have any questions. I am available this afternoon to have a phone conversation or WebEx/Zoom meeting about these changes if needed, just let me know. [Note: I have attached both files from client, "PLUMAS_LOGO_Black_Loan_Address.tif" and "Holiday_Extension CLIENTCHANGES.pdf")


 * Plumas Bank Logo

oUpdate with attached TIF file. Let me know if for any reason you cant. (File size, file type, shape of logo, etc.) This still needs to fit the top left return address window of the envelope the letter is being sent in.
 * Page 1 of 1

oRemove this if it is not needed by InfoImage. I originally left it to serve as a page anchor like our other PDF letters, but it is not necessary.
 * Information Table in Top Right of Page

oMove this up into the space where Page 1 of 1 was. Be sure that it doesnt show through the address window of the return envelope when a client sends the signed letter back to us.
 * Mailing Address for Return Envelope

oWe need to add Plumas Banks mailing address in a place that will fit the address window on the return envelope included with the letter. Place the address horizontally/vertically as needed below the information table in the top right so that it fits the window.

Plumas Bank

PO Box 210

Quincy, CA 95971
 * Right Margin

oIncrease the right-side margin to match the left-side margin. Since there is no barcoding down the left margin, the margins can be equal.
 * Important Note

oThe text repeats If you have automatic payments with a different bank and is missing the text, _If you have automatic payments set up through Plumas Banks loan payment portal, you are responsible for disabling the current recurring payment. You will need to resume your automatic payment once the holiday extension expires._Please insert this text*above*the text regarding autopayments at a different bank.

oThe entire block of text from Important Note down, can be lowered by a line or two.

_IMPORTANT NOTE_

comment: Hi [~berezinez] [~rony]

Updates samples forwarded to client, they had a follow up question:

Also, since I know our marketing team will ask, is it possible to have one of these actually printed on the stationary that they're going to be printed on (and scanned back in so we can see it)? For final approval we'll need to see what that looks like, and we'd also like to see a letter in an envelope as it will be sent, as well as in the return envelope as a client would send it back. We just want to make sure that the logo placement and return address placement fits the windows and all those details are confirmed.


author: rony
comment: Hi [~Bryanl]

So I believe we can provide you print sample first. Then qa can do the envelope test and if look ok we can send it to the client.

But from experience, don't we need a imb bar code below the bank address in the right portion? If yes we need bar code information.

comment: [~rony] I attached the pdf (holiday stationary option 1

) that needs to be an eform for the letter. This needs to be printed with this letter. Can you update and then send over new samples?


author: jessica
comment: [~rony] [~Bryanl]



We do need an IMB on the return address. [~rony] can you add this however if you don't have time to add its ok too.

Please note this will go into a house double window envelope (4401) with a return env. (4403)

Per our call AS will request new stock code and provide here. IS will update the eform and Rony will provide new dpvs with print samples.

Per [~Jessica]we dont need the imb barcode, she spoke with Tina and it would be okay.


author: rony
comment: Hi [~Jessica]

Would you please confirm again that do we need barcode below return address or not? From normal experience since we will use BRE, we will need bar code, right?

!image-2022-10-10-14-31-39-399.png!



If yes please provide us bar code information. And we will use insert bin 1 for BRE.

author: bryanl
comment: Hi [~rony],

Per client:

Thank you for the samples and tap test images. Everything looks good with one small change that our marketing team has asked me to correct if possible. In the last sentence of the first paragraph, the word farther should be corrected to further. "If you need to make your budget dollars gofurtherduring the holidays..."

I also want to confirm that the Date of Notice in the top right is a dynamic date which will be updated to the date that these letter actually get sent? I've noticed that this has been August 5 on all samples provided to us, but I want to be sure that is not the date that gets printed on the final letters.

*Lastly, and most importantly*, due to staffing issues and an upcoming audit, in an effort to not overwhelm our staff, senior management has asked that we postpone the send date of these letters to Oct 28th. I apologize for escalating/rushing this case to then delay it. Please let me know if our go-live date can be changed to Oct 28th.


author: rony
comment: Hi [~Bryanl],



[^plbk0001-3.pdf]

Here 'further' spelling is fixed.

Actually, the Date of Notice in the top right is dynamic.

Also, there is no problem to change the go-live date to Oct 28th.



[~berezinez]

Thanks.


author: jessica
comment: [~rony] [~Bryanl] Just to clarify, is the mail date on 10/28? If so the code would need to be released on 10/25.

No problem with that.

Per client:

Bryan, this looks great, and it is approved. Thank you for confirming the dynamic date field. I have the final data file ready now, but we need to make sure the letters don't get sent until Oct 28th. What day should I send the file in order for the letters to be sent on the 28th?

I am not sure how to answer on this question. Per [~Jessica]in commenthttps://jira.infoimageinc.com/browse/IS-1610?focusedCommentId=53974&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-53974

There was a single typo for "further" which is why Rony had to correct and resend samples, other than that change they are the same as approved print samples.
