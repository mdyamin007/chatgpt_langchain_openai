title: /d/infoftp/ client_pickup folder removal request
description: [~Peter.Dang] and [~Terrence.Tong]:

Here is the smartsheet to manage and update/delete the scripts:

[https://app.smartsheet.com/sheets/72f6MJv4vfXpwh4HX8GqMQ8rXPQP4rJMPrx3CqF1]







[~Terrence.Tong]: Kent informed us during today's IS Brisbane meeting that /d/infoftp FTP server is disabled two weeks ago (~9/18/2020 timeframe I'm guessing).



We need to go back to all the programs to remove any logic where we are copying to /d/infoftp/$cid/client_pickup folder.

Also in removing the code, please make sure there is logic to write to a different /d/infoftp##/ server. If not, please report the issue because we need to make sure we are providing their client_pickup file in a active server.



e.g. of some file I found recently; Please audit and identify any other programs using /d/infoftp:



[williamK@rhs2 ~]$ find /d/infoftp -type f -mtime -12
