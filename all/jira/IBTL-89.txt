comment: [~rogelio_jira]: Can you re-test?  I asked Network to open up the port so that we can communicate to the ISD servers. Please re-assign back to me when you are done to let me know the results.

comment: [~rogelio_jira]: Were you able to test it out and see if it is working?

comment: Still failing in message manager.

comment: [~tient]: Can you help me review this issue? I manually tried to call the two message manager URLs and I do get responses, but I'm not sure why Rogelio is still getting message manager issues:

comment: [~tient]: Thanks for helping me troubleshoot the issue! I had the preprocessing02:/isis/ mount point commented out by accident. Hence that is why/isis/psel3700/pic/psel3pic pseg image converter was missing.



[~rogelio_jira]: Can you retest now?


author: rogelio_jira
comment: Will,

This is showing in my processing. Per Tien need to sync all the folder in /home/keep





Thanks,
Rogelio

comment: [~rogelio_jira]: Thank your for reporting this issue. The /home/keep/elcu/ folder was created on 9/29/2020 in Menlo Data Center. I synced Menlo files to Brisbane a few days prior to it. Hence that is why it may be missing. I'll manually copy it over now so that you can retest:
