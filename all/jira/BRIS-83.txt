title: Brisbane:  Canon i300 / CS6900 eForm Setup & MICR Facility Change
description: **+Per meeting on 1/15/2020 w/ Tina, Calvin C., Ernest, Peter and Kent+

If the new color i300 printer lease is signed by 1/31/2020, the following is the plan:


 * There is roughly 80 clients that we need to setup an eForm on the Canon i300 Cutsheet (CS) and Canon 6900 Continuous Roll Feed (CF). Here is the smart sheet link:[https://app.smartsheet.com/sheets/mVQ7cX5xvRwM7MMWGQxhr2GxJqPWHHCQ7JpC43h1|http://example.com]
 * The two Canon I300 Color Inkjet Cutsheet printers for Brisbane is still pending decision by 1/31/2020.
 * Canon Professional Service is quote the hours to help us to color matching for all these forms.
 * Regardless of having the i300 color printers or not, we will be testing with the Texas Prisma control server for the new eForms. Per Tina, the eForm will color matching will be compatible between i300 and CS6900 as long as we are using the same paper mill type.
 * If we get the i300 printer, we still need to migrate some existing clients over to Texas due to Brisbane facility capacity is a lot smaller.
 * We will have+one+ Vario Monochrome printer installed
 * Brisbane will NOT support MICR ink jobs. All the MICR ink jobs needs to be updated and re-routed to Texas facility to print.

comment: Here are my bullet point notes from 1/15/2020 Meeting:





*+PRINTERS:+*

One Vario Monochrome printer installed this Thursday [Non-MICR Capability] in Menlo Park. This new monochrome printer will be used in Brisbane as well.

Two i300 Canon series plus printers [Tentative: Pending Executive Mgmt Agreement]
 * Last week March install to end of April be ready for internal print testing.

No finishing equipment; so we will have stock perf material.

There are 80 forms that Canon will need to do color matching:
 * End of February for first batch 1/3 of the batch; (Ive requested to see if 5 to 8 forms for my team to get eForm).
 * As long as the same paper mill, the color matching quality will match between Texas Canon CF and Brisbane i300 series.



*+INSERTERS:+*

Four existing pitney bowes to three new Pitney Bowes (Bluecrest):
 * Its almost 3 times faster
