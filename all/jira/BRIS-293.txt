title: ca-dds-pr-01: Port 1433 Access
description: [~premraj.patil]: According to Terrence, we lost access to port 1433 on the ca-dds-pr-01 system:



{color:#de350b}"{color}{color:#de350b}However, camera system cannot connect to the following from both 10.5.20.39 and 10.4.20.25.{color}

{color:#de350b}$mdds_host = 'ca-dds-pr-01.infoimageinc.com:1433';{color}

{color:#de350b}But I could connect from 10.4.20.31{color}

{color:#de350b}"{color}



I checked and I believe we did request this before but this configuration is gone. Can you please reconfigure again. Once completed, please re-assign to Terrence to double-check.

comment: [~Terrence.Tong]: Can you double-check the connection? Prem restored port 1433 access to ca-dds-pr-01.



From Brisbane*ca-etaboard-pr-01* I check port 1433 is open on ca-dds-pr-01:
