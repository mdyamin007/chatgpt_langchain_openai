title: Hypercube - Update Hypercube to set tab-title for HTML presentment type
description: Wrapper service is responsible for setting the tab-title while a pdf/html statement is opened from Hypercube. For some reason wrapper service is not setting the correct title for html presentment type. Hypercube will be updated to set it from frontend.
