comment: create a separate cvs_rm.sh program to delete file from cvs.

program also remove file from production folder.

prompt user if the file was recreated from dead file.

program execution permit only by authorized user (manager).



cvs remove -f filename

cvs ci "comment"

comment: cvs_rm.pl comment [optional: file list]
Interface similar to cvs_co.pl. Prompt user for file to be deleted if a list is not provided at run time.
Ensure on main user can run this script.
Output log to $home_keep/keep/cvs_remove_files.log
Output to /home/keep/cvs_remove_files_tb.txt
foreach removed file
 get file path
 run cvs co filePath/file
 cd filePath
 cvs remove -f removed_file
 cvs commit -m "comments"
 write to log
 #remove from production folder.
 rm -f filePath/file
 
 
 
 #verify result check Attic file
 #ssh 10.8.9.40
 #cd /extra/is_cvs

comment: [~Peter.Dang]: This ticket is to test RCS and not adding the "Delete" feature for the CVS Check In/Out. 

See BRIS-9: 

https://jira.infoimageinc.com/browse/BRIS-9



*FEEDBACK*: Specifications should be documented in "Description" field instead of comments field. I would like to us to document all specifications Description field for Jira system moving forward.

comment: I didn't see the comment I posted yesterday.

Peter and I tested for the standard file extensions (ex. .sh, .dfa, .control).

However, I need to update script for those not standard extensions (ex. isisdisk.sh.log) as the extentions cannot be found with the get_file_path_cvs function.

Will pass in the full path for non standard file extensions. check if full path, will not get path through get_file_path_cvs function.

Have some tasks due mid march so changing due date for this to 3/31/2020.

comment: Peter and I tested today for

-non standard and standard file ext

-passing in file lists and also not passing in to prompt for file

-tested passing in file path and not pass in file path for standard file ext

We concluded the code is ready to be release and released code today.
