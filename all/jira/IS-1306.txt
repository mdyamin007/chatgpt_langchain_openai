Per client:

The PMI notice has been approved. They would like the changes you suggested on the notice. Please remove the square character, the alignment on the right side of your attachment is the one they want to use and the larger logo is the want they want to use as well. Thank you for suggestions!

When will this be live?

I will provide updated SOW soon, thanks!

comment: Hi [~Andrey.Kutsenko]

Normally we do print the logo little more right position but there are already exisitng letters for this wash daily from which followed the position for example letter 055, 056 which are already in production.



For letter 068 that we implemented:

!image-2022-07-20-10-32-40-038.png!



Letter 056 which is in production:

!image-2022-07-20-10-33-00-434.png!



So I think we should be ok . Let me know.

comment: Hi [~rony]

Following codes have been released.

But I have concern for this unusual released. The assessment details is for setup 10 new notices and the status is still in "Waiting for approval". I don't know why we are releasing ONLY for two notices updates (DL 018 and DL068). You may need rush for those first.

Please make sure work with [~Peter.Dang], [~Bryanl]and QA.

Thanks,
