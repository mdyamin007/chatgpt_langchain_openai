comment: [~tohidulI]: Hi Tohid. Can you re-test?  Apparently I did remove the data hostname from /etc/hosts file and it was temporarily pointing to prod instead of dev database. It's fixed. Also i did not correct that tnsadmin.ora file to use sid=wodb.  Please retest now:

comment: [~tohidulI]: Unfortunately now I can not have your confirm.  This is because we shutdown the database in preparation for this upcoming Saturday's conversation weekend. I'm going to assign this ticket back to me for now.
