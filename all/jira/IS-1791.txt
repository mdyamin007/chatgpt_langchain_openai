comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid]



DPVS:[^sfcedla128.print]

ISD index file:[^dla_20221028__20221110_0557_sfce.txt]



Here we added enotice on letters 112 and 113. Therefore the index file only contains information about letters 112 and 113.

Also added the account type NA.

Rony - the Index file should be posted on Stage?

I can't post it, I'm getting error, who from ISD site was assigned to this update?

comment: [~berezinez]I did not realize this was in QA already. Shun and I were supposed to meet later today on these letters.

after your meeting with Shun, please let me know when it's ready for QA and I'll verify the changes.


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~berezinez] Fyi it's because the dla prefix is not setup yet, hence the error. I can configure it and add the new letter codes/descriptions after the meeting and let you know after.

comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima]- Thank you, please let me know once it's ready for QA.

comment: [~berezinez] I've added both letter codes/descriptions and the dla prefix, can you try posting the index file again on stage?

comment: [~rony] Actually I just tried posting the index file onto pilot and realized the filename is missing what I believe is the segment value between the two date values (i.e. I think it should be something like dla_20221028_*1*_20221110_0557_sfce.txt). Can you check on this and provide a new index file?

QA pass, the latest Index file posted on Stage with enotices 112, 113.

please send for client approval.



*****after approval please provide PR_ID.


author: JIRAUSER11400
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima]- Would we be able to post the enotice files from June 2022 to current.



Also, can we post this to pilot for client to review?


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~Ricky Lopez] I've posted the file onto pilot successfully, here's some accounts to check:

112 - 85646, 61145, 50261
113 - 99012, 107410, 135679

When you say June 2022 to current, are you referring to a pre-ingestion?
