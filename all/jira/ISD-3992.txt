title: 17883 - IDCU - DP/Commercial loan emails failed
description: None

comment: Did further research on their comm loan emails, turns out all comm loan statuses are on paper. There are comm loan paperless files being sent to us, but for some reason they are not autoposting, therefore paperless status is not getting updated for comm loan. Although the app was setup maybe around 2017, we first triggered an email job on 1/5/21.

Unsure whether there was a change in the business rules, still pending response from Kris.
