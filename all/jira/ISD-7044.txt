This is deployed onto pilot. I have generated some sample reports.

[^CheckingSavingsStatementFrom01012021To05182022.txt]

[^Closed Escrow AnalysisStatementFrom01012021To05182022.txt]

[^LoansStatementFrom01012021To05182022.txt]

[^NoticesStatementFrom01012021To05182022.txt]



The client can also go and generate the reports themselves.
