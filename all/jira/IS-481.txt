Verified two sets on pilot:

Suppressed accounts not displaying on pilot in 11/8 cycle:

Accounts that should display on pilot (not suppressed) in 11/8 cycle - appeared as expected in pilot:

Do we need the parallel for this update? If yes, please create TS ticket for parallel.

There is no change in format so we don't need to test paper printing.

We may need to test processing wise and estatement posting.
