I think it is okay to have createAccount enabled on Development. However, that should not be enabled on the higher environment (Pilot, Stage, etc.)

comment: Code has been committed to hypercube branch, trunk and infotrac dev.

Archival period was not given for etax. So now it is same as default.

Processing UI code has been deployed to pilot.

comment: Hi [~tai.trinh]

In EtaxRegistrarFactory, we've used HypercubeEtaxRegistrar, it was basically developed for TKCU migration. The difference between EtaxRegistrar3 and HypercubeEtaxRegistrar is that, in EtaxRegistrar3, if an user is created based on the global.autoregistrar flag, then a SSO date is inserted for that user. This logic doesn't exist in HypercubeEtaxRegistrar. And another difference is if user is created in EtaxRegistrar3, it doesn't insert in usr_mapping table, but in HypercubeEtaxRegistrar, it inserts in usr_mapping table, which is required for new hypercube clients. HypercubeEtaxRegistrar was developed to keep consistency with HypercubeEstmtRegistrar.  Let me know your thoughts on this.

Thanks,
Rifat

Hi Rifat,

I have reviewed the HypercubeEtaxRegistrar and the differences from ETaxRegistrar3. Everything looks good. 

Thanks,
Tai
