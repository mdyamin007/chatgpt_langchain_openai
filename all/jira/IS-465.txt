update is just change the script to accept the data with new naming . You can check the script. I ran with
 
 /z/download/suru/SURU_AEEInvoice_082621_082040.txt
 and
 /z/download/suru/SURU_SnapNRack_Invoice_082621_082050.txt
 data files.



Thanks,

Rony

comment: Parallel can be ignored since this is pretty tiny update and we don't have time actually.



I will ask Peter to release code.
