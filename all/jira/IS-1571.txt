Please use the attached new Tiff files and provide a revised sample to review and approve. See client's feedback below.

"Sorry, we need to provide you with a different Tiff file for the front of the disclosure. The previous version had the logo in greyscale but we prefer this to be in Black. Please use the attached Tiff files and provide us with a revised sample to review and approve."

Please fix and provide new sample. See client's comment below.

*******************************************************

In the letter for auto-renewed certificates, the email address for the credit union has a  instead of the @ symbol (see below). The TIS looks to be the correct version.

"Please contact the Credit Union at (808) 930-1400 or toll free at (800) 216-2666, visit our website at www.hfsfcu.org, email us at hfs_operationshfsfcu.org or visit any one of our Branch Offices."

Customer responded to the sample:

We have reviewed the revised sample you provided. The letter and accompanying TIS-Share Certificate Disclosure look good.

Print samples are printed duplex. Whereas, in SOW it's displayed as Simplex. Can you confirm which is correct
 !screenshot-3.png|thumbnail! 
Letter is printed simplex, disclosure is printed duplex.

The@ symbol in email address is large on production sample. Client requested to fix it before release cycles #24, #25 , #26 and #27.

Pleasechange the font size to font 9 for "@" sign.

Update: The font size of '@' is changed from 11 to 9.

Project HFCUDL006.zip is in the QA folder.

PDF sample:[^hfcudl006.pdf]



This is a small change so I believe we can skip dpvs and index file.

comment: HI [~rony], [~misbah.uddin@dsinnovators.com], [~dawnl],[~gthillaivel],

I think we need either print sample to review or AC need to audit the production output, before release the production jobs. Because special characters can get unexpected result in print output.
