he statement I captured does not have the inline insert. QA needs to check the inline insert in the print sample to see how its printed (vertically or horizontally and top or in the middle of the page).
So we need the print range for printing the account with the inline insert

Please provide print range that's on account list for print sample request.

Sorry for the incorrect print range. Print range should be 985-991.
