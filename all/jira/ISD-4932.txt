title: SUCU - SSO Analysis
description: There are two different sets of values:
 # *Member Number*: 12345
 ** Statements will be posted to this number.
 # *Agreement Number*: 7777...
 ** Q2 will pass this as the user_fi_number, which will be stored as the CIF.
 ** We will not consider any of the account numbers that Q2 may pass in the SSO Request.

Client will provide an Enrollment file that has the *Agreement Number* and *Member Number*. The process will create the usr_mapping with*Agreement Number* and link the user to an account represented by the*Member Number*.



When the user SSO in, we will only only grant acces to*Agreement Number* that already exists in the usr_mapping table that is linked to a Member Number. Otherwise, access is denied.



Can this already be done? If not, what enhancements are necessary?
