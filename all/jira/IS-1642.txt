Pre-Ingestion files will have a different format than production files being sent. IS will need to setupa different program to parse the data file instead of a PDF.

I've processed 2022-05 month's of data
attached are accounts numbers:[^dda_preingestion_accounts.txt]

These jobs won't show up in infotrac but you can see them in PUI.
You will be able to search in the Account Management tab though.
Thanks
