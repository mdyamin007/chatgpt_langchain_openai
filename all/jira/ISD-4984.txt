title: EWBB [21425] [pvt] Missing HK Bounceback email report [in house]
description: Per Tai - In House Update
EWBB - Missing HK Bounceback email report 
Description: Update HK Bounceback email report to generate 
This will be done by August 11, before the next Bounce back. 

Notes:
Need to enable bounceback email recipient flag in conf file. --added
Can't really test bounceback report because it tries to pull from production, therefore connection errors occur. However, we can still test other reports that are under file/upload
-- Issue was occurring because bouncebackReport was not initially designed to send out emails if there are multiple reports created within the same job.

Just fyi, I'm currently testing this update. So far things look good, I am looking to release this to production next wed, 8/25. I will provide an update if anything changes.

Thanks,
Shun

comment: [~barnetts], this is still on track. This will require a PUI restart, therefore I will have to wait until all the postings and email jobs are completed at EOD. I'll update again once this is complete.

comment: [~barnetts], I released the code to production and re-enabled emails to send to the following addresses when the HK bounceback has been processed:
eric.castaneda@eastwestbank.com
Cliff.kishimoto@eastwestbank.com
