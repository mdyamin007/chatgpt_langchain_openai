title: FRST (L) Change Individual PDF names for AFS Annual Borrower Statement sent back to FRB [18269][pvt]
description: see JEF #48319
 # Redtitan program needs to be modified with new field to pick up pdf name from bottom left corner. ( needs to be re-done if they keep the new format)
 # DFA needs to be changed to add a field to handle pdf names and use that as archival pdf names.
 # script needs to be modified as well if we need to process the pdfs separately.

comment: Hi [~kdishroon] ,

The PDFs inside the test data have different naming convention than the current files. I wasn't able to find any mention of changing incoming file in the ticket. Can you please advise.

comment: Hi Hosein,

The naming convention is the change requested here; the client wants to change the current naming convention.

Please let me know if you have additional questions.

Thank-you,

Keri


author: hkhosravani
comment: From my understanding the client wants to change the naming convention of the files we send back to them.



I am asking about the naming convention of the input file. We receive one large PDF with naming conventionFRST_EOYSTMT_YYYY.pdf, however the test file is a zip file containing many pdf files with different naming.

If this is the new way client is sending data we need to change the job description and time estimate.

comment: Hi Hosein,

The client sent a new file[^FRST_EOYSTMT_2020_1.zip]


author: hkhosravani
comment: this file has the same issue. it also has extra headers compare to the pdf from last year, in addition it has some values moved up, which would require the redtitan program to be changed as well.

comment: Hi [~andyp],

Per the client: {color:#1f4e79}Name should include underscore _ instead of{color}{color:#1f4e79} - . Can you change that ?{color}

{color:#1f4e79}Thank-you,{color}

{color:#1f4e79}Keri{color}

The name in the PDF had the "-".

Could you check with customer whether they can change it to "_" on their end?

author: kdishroon
comment: [~Peter.Dang]- Per the SCRUM today, please provide a new scope of work and timeline:

The client would like the archival names to be underscores instead of dashes, but they are unable to change the PDFs they send to us.

Thank-you,

Keri


author: peter.dang
comment: [~kdishroon] [~andyp] 

Keri per our discussion, we have 2 options below:


 # check if the bank is using the statement date in the index file. If not, we can populate a processing date for this field. And will capture the filename from PDF to be used in the place holder of the statement date. We can program to alter the file name with dash to underscore character. This will require 4 hours programming.
 # Upgrade this application to the latest processing version, which have more flexible to capture any new field from PDF file and modify it for downstream processing. Upgrading this application to include the filename changing will require 10 programming hours.

comment: [~andyp] and [~Peter.Dang]

Per the client:

"We thought it would be better if AFS makes the change instead of you guys . So we will just go with what you have done , using hyphen in the PDF names. You will not have to make any other changes for now.

However we will be sending another test file in couple of weeks , if you can process the file and send us samples .We can complete the testing and then can move this change to production."

author: kdishroon
comment: Hi [~andyp] The samples have an underscore, the client was expecting a hyphen?




author: andyp
comment: [~kdishroon]

Per comment on Oct 13, customer want use "_" instead of "-".

Please check that comment.

The latest sample had "_" in individual PDF file name.

comment: Hi [~andyp] ,

Per my comment on 10/18:

author: andyp
comment: [~kdishroon]

Per your comment on 09/18, customer still want "_" in the individual PDF file names. It meant that they make that change on their end.



FYI, if they want "-" in the file name, the first set of sample had that feature. Could you check with customer to review it?


author: kdishroon
comment: Hi [~andyp] - Yes, that is what they want, the hyphen in the file name but they want new samples from the test file they just recently sent.


author: andyp
comment: [~kdishroon]

The test data that they sent on Nov 15 was actually InfoImage generated PDF files. It had the added logo and endorsement line.

!image-2021-12-09-10-52-08-358.png!



Please request customer to send the test data file from their vendor. It should have the following format.

comment: [~kdishroon]

FYI,

The first set of sample had hyphen in the file name and I used last year data file to generate it.
