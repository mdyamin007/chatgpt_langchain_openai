comment: Hi [~phoebe.george],

The below specs will be applicable for daily also? Please confirm.
 # I'll update the specs, the first is the cycle date (not the processing date). This should match the customer file name date stamp. The second date is the Processing Timestamp (the date that the PDF archival file is processed/generated. I'll update the description accordingly.
 # It should be batches of 5,000. I'll eliminate the second option based on file sizes.



Thanks

comment: [~Najoa] Sorry about that, the DN specs do match what we discussed for the mo stmts. I'll update the description now. Thank you!

comment: Hi [~phoebe.george],

We have a few queries regarding daily notices which I am listing down below. But still, if you have any issues regarding these let us know. Tomorrow we can have a quick call   
 # We need data files for the following letters: *004, 005, 009, 010, 012, 013, and 016.* We searched it in many production data files but could not find any.
 # Letters *016 and 021* are *not present* in the *procs file,* so will this be *discarded*?

!image-2022-05-11-17-06-20-275.png|width=465,height=229!

3. For some account numbers we do not have member numbers in the Xref file. In that case for estatement we suppressed those accounts which do not have member no. For archival also should we do the same?

4. Letter 008,017 and 019 do not have account numbers in datafiles, hence no member number. So it will not have any archival right?

5. For the *beginning and the closing date* we are choosing the *notice date*. But there are *letters* that *don't have a notice date*. In that case, should we use the *processing date* or the *date given in the data file*? Let us know.

6. Do we need to work on 014? Actually, it was crossed out in the word file you provided.

!image-2022-05-11-17-59-18-604.png!

7. While analyzing found an issue in datafile for letter 023

Datafile Name: SUCU_NOTICES_04052022_2.zip

Column 7 should always be zipcode but instead, it's showing state and in place of account no it's showing zip code.

comment: [~Najoa] Please see updates below.
 # I will need to request files from the CU; these notices are note produced every day, and so it may be difficult to locate prod files. I'll provide an update once requested.
 # Letter 016 should be a current notice, but it is annual; Letter 021 can be removed. I will try to locate more information on the Letter 016 from the AC, and will provide an update.
 # For notices with no member number, please still include in the archival file, but keep the member number field empty.
 # I will check with the customer on how to handle accounts with no account numbers for these 3 notices.
 # For notices with no Notice Date, please use Processing Date.
 # Ltr 014 is a current/active notice that should be included with the setup; I will update the word file. We will eventually be removing this notice, but not for awhile, it was crossed out pre-maturely because of this.
 # Is this an issue with the data or our program? If a data issue, I'll inform the CU.

Thank you!
Phoebe

Hi [~phoebe.george], yes it's a datafile issue. Headers have 10 columns but the first customer has 11 col


author: JIRAUSER10907
comment: Hi [~phoebe.george] the missing data files were not included in the test files.

Also, let us know the problem mentioned above regarding letter 023 datafile

author: phoebe.george
comment: [~Najoa] I'll try to locate the addition test files from the DSI programmer that worked on the eNotices and/or from QA.

In the meantime, SUCU confirmed that we will REMOVE Letters 008, 017 and 019 from the setup since they will not contain account numbers.

Is it possible to provide a small sample set up front to confirm if the indexes, etc are good before applying to the rest of the notices as I locate the additional test files? I don't want the programmer to have to make edits for all notices once the full sample set is provided in case there are changes needed.

Thanks,

Phoebe


author: JIRAUSER10907
comment: hi [~phoebe.george],

Tomorrow we will provide the sample for monthly statements.

For daily, we need a few more days.

Along with the missing data files please provide us its corresponding day Xref file.





Thanks

Najoa


author: JIRAUSER10907
comment: Hi [~phoebe.george],

Please update the live date for daily and for monthly also.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~Najoa] Can you confirm if still possible to provide some of the notice PDF archival samples that you have data for? Due to the # of notice types, just want to make sure this is good before you update for all.

Thanks!


author: JIRAUSER10907
comment: [~phoebe.george]ok we will try to provide some of the letters soon before the sample date.

Any feedback from the client? Should we proceed with the other letters for archival?

Also please provide us with the data file that were missing:*004, 005, 009, 010, 012, 013, and 016*

For letter 023 there was a data file, any update about it?

Please update the SOW

comment: [~tanmay] [~Najoa] I received approvals on the two daily notice sets that you provided. Let me know if you can generate for the other notices that you have test files available. I will continue to try and locate the other notices in the meantime. Can you let me know what date you may be able to provide the remaining test samples for the files that you have and I can determine a new target live date specific to the notices (since the statements are approved, the live date for notices may be different). 

Thanks,

Phoebe


author: william.kong
comment: [~tanmay]: [~phoebe.george]is trying to find the missing notices so that we can create additional daily letter test files for the 2nd round of final samples. It would be nice to get this live by July 1, however, if you need more time in light of the other SEFC Mortgage project, then please propose new live date and final approval date based on your workload.

For now, I've changed the live date from 5/31 to 7/1.

comment: [~Najoa] [~tanmay] I'm SO sorry i have not been able to focus on this project! SUCU had some delays and have a working session tomorrow. Is it possible to generate a PDF test batch based on this latest production file? Let me know if you need the location, but it was sent today, 7/6 called: SUCU_NOTICES_07052022_2.zip.pgp

If possible, can you create the PDF Archival samples based on this as we work to create the missing files still?

author: phoebe.george
comment: [~tanmay] SUCU reported that the names in the latest DN sample did not match what was provided in the table for index field #7. 

For example, 'Frequent Overdraft Notice' was showing as 'Freq Overdraft' in the index file. Can these names be updated? Once updated, please re-create the 7/5 cycle please. The notice names are listed in the description, but here is the list:
||Reference notice name per Doc Type:
 * Overdraft Notice
 * Returned Deposit Check Notice
 * Loan Payoff Notice
 * Loan Rate & Payment Change Notice
 * W8-BEN Foreign Certification Notice
 * Loan Payment Notice
 * Unclaimed Property Notice

comment: [~Najoa] I talked with SUCU yesterday. They confirmed that the W8 notice (013) is approved. I'm pending their confirmation on the 4 remaining test files for the annual notices that are still pending. I will provide the test file as soon as confirmed. Sorry I have not yet been able to schedule a new live date. As soon as I get the remaining files (as I need the last production cycle date from the CU since they are annual), I will be able to work with you on the target new live date. Thanks for your patience!

author: phoebe.george
comment: [~Najoa] I have received final approval on the Daily Notice PDF archival samples.

Note that there are 4 annual files that the CU has not yet provided data files for, so these will NOT be included with the setup. If the CU chooses to add these later on, they will be submitted as a programming request once they have data files available:
 * Loan YTD Balance Notice  Annual
 * Unclaimed Property Notice  Annual
 * B Notice  Annual
 * Annual CUNA Letter  Annual

Please prepare for next steps for QA. I will work on updating the SOW accordingly.

Can we target a 9/23/22 live date?

[~Igor.Khosid] FYI for now. This is the final PDF archival setup for SUCU for their notices.
