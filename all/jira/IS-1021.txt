comment: [~phoebe.george]: Please advise if the 5/31 live date is accurate. Per [~thomasY], his understanding is that this due date is temporary. Please advise.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~William.Kong] [~thomasY] Yes, it is temporary. Based on the turnover meeting previously, I'm still pending a sample date to update the due date/live date and timeline.

Please provide the sample date and I'll update accordingly.



Thanks!

author: thomasy
comment: [~phoebe.george]Do we have any data to generate the samples with? I can't find any backed up.

comment: [~thomasY] Thank you! CU has been notified for review/feedback/approval.

comment: [~thomasY]: I'm going to mark your Story to Jun 17 base on seeing the EPIC Due date is set to Jun 17,


author: william.kong
comment: [~phoebe.george]: Please advise status on Approvals. Live date is Friday, June 17 and we need to have time for QA and Parallel run. I really don't believe we can make 6/17 live date. If this is going to be a concern, please let us know ASAP. We do not want to miss another launch date for this client and get escalated by the CEO again.

We received approval of the test files. Please confirm if we can update the live date to 6/28/22.

Thank you!


author: thomasy
comment: [~phoebe.george]Yes, 6/28 will be ok.


author: william.kong
comment: [~thomasY]: Per our conversation, please submit this to QA.



[~phoebe.george]: This project will require parallel.
