although this for aee and snr William also wanted to add header tag missing message for surums5. So it's in parallel id too.

You can check the*verify_data_file_integrity***method. So there will be header which will contain the count of total accounts and if it doesn't match with total accounts script will abort.



**like for aee and snr data file at the top HDRCNT:

!image-2022-05-27-23-46-21-109.png!



for surums5 at the bottom Total Invoice Count:

!image-2022-05-27-23-48-11-879.png!



Not sure what more I can submit, I can show you some log :

!image-2022-05-27-23-54-25-296.png!



if header not present the script will catch this error.



and if count not matches it will also catch and throw error and abort:

Thanks
