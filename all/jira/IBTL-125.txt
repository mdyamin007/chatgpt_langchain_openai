comment: [~cesarg]: Per our conversation. You were able to troubleshoot the issue.  Apparently there is /z/ftpbu/hccubu/monthly and /z/ftpbu/hccubu/Monthly. The "Monthly" is the correct one and you are processing now.



Can you please assign to me when you are done. I want to delete this folder in both Menlo & Brisbane to prevent this issue from happening in the future again.



Thanks!
