comment: [~dyuen] do we have a new live date for this?


author: dyuen
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima], yes. I updated the due date for next month. This is still on MFCU's radar, it's just lower on the priority list.

comment: Hi [~Shun.Kuwashima] , please cancel this Jira. MFCU was able to make a change on their end that resolved this.

Thanks!
