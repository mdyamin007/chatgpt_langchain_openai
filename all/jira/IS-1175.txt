The sample - ready for the client review

The verbiage is incorrect, please see client's response below.
Not sure if I am reading this correcting (print is small ) but does it say 64 months?  It should read 66 months.  Let me know.  Thanks.

Per the screenshot attached, it says 64 months right? So the client changed their mind?





Thanks

I believe it was a typo in their screenshot, this is the written verbiage they provided.  

We need to add this: The 13 month, 42 month, 54 month and 66 moth certificates will roll into a 12 month certificate at maturity

h3. HI Guys,
h3. *Wondering why the code - was released. QA is not finished testing yet. Are you guys following our workflow?*


author: igor.khosid
comment: [~rumanb] - please check with [~rony] for the current work flow

comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid]

Sorry I instructed [~rumanb] to release the code. This was one line update, and since you already tested the sample and sent it to the client and the client approved it. And no parallel was needed. So we went for release directly. Let me know if we needed to turn it over to you again in this scenario after the client's approval. I myself did this for many small change request tasks where parallel was not needed.



Thanks

Rony -I know this is the only verbiage update; however, I was planning to ask for the actual print samples.  We are adding an additional section and it is always good to check on the actual print samples 


author: igor.khosid
comment: h3. *Actual print samples - not reviewed as the project already released to production
h3. Passed - with comments - see above*
