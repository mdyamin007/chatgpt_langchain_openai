title: CAMB - [24724][pvt] Customer received e-mail for an account she should not of
description: From the logs, it looks like we did send out two emails to chamberland.denise@gmail.com, however they were on different days because they were for different applications:



[12/01/2021 11:01:35] - Monthly Statement

[12/02/2021 17:00:20] -Inactive/Dormant Account Notice



Second, the email address is tied to this CIF bar30bri25ab|ring12ton376 and both account relationships (11040227 and11040235) have been existing since 2/28/19. If the relationship with acct11040227 needs to be removed, it would require a 1 hour manual update on our end.



1 hour to remove.



Tentative timeline:

Turnover: 1/13

Live: 1/14
