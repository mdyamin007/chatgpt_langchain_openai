comment: To QA,
 # Please do SSO with multiple accounts having available eStatement on Stage environment.
 # Change the delivery preference of one account to Paper.
 # Switch to that account.
 # Now switch to another account that is in Electronic.
 # Observe if the eStatements of Paper account can be seen for a couple of seconds or not.
