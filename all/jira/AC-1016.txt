*NOTES TO DEV:*

Please adjust substring section for Volume column under Account Analysis section. The volume is stored in variable 'TXT_STRING3'. Please adjust this variable's SUBSTR call to capture from 139 for 7 bytes. You will also need to make the text box a bit wider. Please test using account 7190017299 from the July EOM file. Also test other accounts to make sure Account Analysis section looks correct.
