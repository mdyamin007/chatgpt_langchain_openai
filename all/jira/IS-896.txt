title:  APCU [23816] [pvt] Participating Member Statement with DSO Integration
description: **NOTE: Current program copies the Participation Stmts. OK to release now as we will adjust this post launch with archival.**



Set-up Participating Member Statement with DSO Integration.

IS:

Participating Member Statement will be a separate application cloned from APCU's existing Monthly Statements.

No print, only electronic statements for setup.

*PDF archival to be confirmed (if ok to include with regular monthly statement PDF archival) - TBD

Use same template as existing monthly statements for ALL formatting; setup for posting electronically only.

Data for these statements will need to be extracted from the existing Monthly Statement Symitar file and generated into a separate file based on identification of the following - if this criteria is met, extract to a separate file to be processed as the Participating Member Statement:

Check Record 200, field 18 - this will hold the 'Account Type' number.

Anything between 8000 - 8999 will be considered the Loan Participant member.

Test file provided - see attached.

IS test processed this file; attached output in PDF; customer has approved this version.

ISD:

This new application will be accessed through a new/separate DSO channel (separate and in addition to existing SSO channel).

Posting tab name = Loan Partnerships

Use updated 'CIF' test file - attached.

comment: [~rumanb] [~rony] Hi Rony - checking in as you were going to provide sample date this week. Please provide soonest available date so we can come as close to the 4/1 live date as possible.

Thanks!


author: rony
comment: Hi [~kericapote]

Sample date is 18. We will provide a sample next week.



Thanks

comment: [~rumanb] [~rony] confirming pdf sample for Friday.

Thanks!

comment: Attached is pdf sample from test file provided in the story.

We will provide the index file by Monday.




author: rony
comment: Hi [~kericapote],

So when the current apcu statement program will kick off we will extract the data for this one from original data and will put it ftp scanner directory.

The data name for this project will be*APCU_Participating_Member_Stmt_mmddyyyy_seg.zip.pgp*

and will be available in*JHABU/APCU/*

please update the sow accordingly. And the prefix we are using is apcums3(the existing one is apcums2).



Thanks




author: kericapote
comment: [~rony]thanks! Please also send this info to ISD so they can post to pilot.


author: kericapote
comment: [~rumanb]PDF approved. Please send to ISD to post to InfoTrac.

comment: Hi [~kericapote]

Attached is the zip version of archival sample. We will be using this name for archival[^APCU_PARTICIPATION_MEMBER_STMT_Archival_031820_1.zip]. It will be .zip.pgp format finally.



I also forwarded you the email for dpvs. Check this subject:APCU Participation Member Statement - cycle 18 is ready[TEST ENVIRONMENT]

to find email.

Another important thing, we will be using marketing messages from existing dda statement. There is not separated message setup for this new one.

Let me know anything more you need.

Thanks

Rony

comment: [~rony] [~rumanb] archival is approved. Just a note - this archive can be in the same archive as monthly statements. it does not need to be separated out to its own archive.


author: rony
comment: Sorry [~kericapote],are you saying that we don't need to generate an archival sample for this participation member(apcums3)? Existing dda statement(apcums2) archival is already enough?

If not, then would you please explain your previous message with a short example?

If yes then I can just simply disable the archival generation code from the participation member script(apcums3).


author: kericapote
comment: [~rony] we can send them one archival that has all the statements and Participating Member Statement archives together.


author: rony
comment: Sorry [~kericapote]

That will make our code complex, please check if the client is ok with separate archival.


author: kericapote
comment: [~rony] [~rumanb] please provide index file for ISD to post to e pilot.

Thanks!


author: kericapote
comment: [~rony]APCU says about the archive:

If there is no other option, but if at all possible wed prefer in the same archival. At least could it be sent over with the normal archival?



Could it be considered the last zip file? For example if we have 200,000 traditional statements, which means we have 20 archival zip files (10k in each zip). Can the Loan Partnership archival files be zip file #21?


author: rony
comment: Sorry [~kericapote]

we are treating this as a completely separate application. Once data comes monthly we will be extracting the data for this dso app from original file . After that these 2 apps will be processed independently. So it might happen that dso archival will get generated much earlier than the monthly app. Bottom line we normally don't merge the archival sample for 2 different app. Please raise this to [~Peter.Dang] or [~William.Kong]if it is a must requirement for the client.


author: kericapote
comment: [~rony] [~rumanb] we are going to proceed with the job as we don't want the pdf archival to hold up this job. We are trying to be live for 4/1 so we moved QA up. Please send to QA asap. Thx!

comment: [~Igor.Khosid] there is no BA on this. 

There are no print samples as it is E only. Approved sample is posted to pilot site.

This needs to go live for month end. We have to have these posted no later tan 4/7.

Archival is going to be released after month end as the client wants us to combine it with month end statements.

Let me know if you need anything else,

Hi Ruman,

I processed file ms3_20220122_1_20220329_0618_apcu.txt on Pilot PUI successfully. The file has only 2 accounts.

I verified SSO and InfoTrac sites.

To verify DSO site I need SSN/DOB/Account number to create new login to DSO site or I need to have credentials (login/password) to get to the site and verify it.

Please provide this information.

Thank you,

Natasha

Rony, do I need to test DSO site?

Thank you,

Can't proceed with the testing

Keri, I can't test without Sarwar providing data for DSO testing

Thank you,

Processed on PUI accounts from index file 'ms3_20220122_1_20220329_0618_apcu.txt' (#1329796, #1329797) were used already to login to SSO page, it gave error 'ACCT_EXIST' on URL, when I tried to create new user for DSO page.

I set up access with account number 1331250 from the file Igor gave me, DSO site works but it was no pdf statements for this account on DSO site.

I verified pdf statements on SSO member site and on Admin site.

I think it is good enough, but let me know if I need another index file to process to verify pdf statements on DSO site.

Thank you,

Natasha

comment: hi [~nprimak],

Since the client hasn't provided a new CIF, We have processed a sample CIF provided by[~kericapote]. So you can test DSO using the following details.
 # SSN: 666827897, DOB:07251988, (ACCOUNT NUMBER: 1329796) [removed their SSO connection]
 # SSN:666463921, DOB:07261988, (ACCOUNT NUMBER:1329797)[removed their SSO connection]

the above user also has statements linked with them. so you can test the whole process.

!image-2022-04-01-09-30-49-333.png!





If I understand the requirements correctly, if we are separating this job as separate applications, then archival needs to be separated out. It cannot be combined back into the same PDF archival. If there are any questions or concerns, please let me know.

comment: Hi [~TunA]

Need your help to release this too.



Resources are in my xfer folder.[^IS-752_PROGRAM_TRANSFER_FORM.doc]

isisdisk.sh has only change so that apcums3 can use the msg mgr from apcums2.

Please copy production apcums2_mail.lis to apcums3_mail.lis
