comment: [~Igor.Khosid]: This is for the cron automation only, the AOLP was already live.

PR_ID:20211014143821.

updated bypass, add update_dt_job_id.pl, and update transmission_files for .ran as it is currently incorrect in production.

Please see log file I attached. It is from test cron process. We will bypass paarallel.
