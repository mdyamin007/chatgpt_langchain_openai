Are these 2 files part ofHCCU_DL_MMDDYY.zip.pgp or it will be in "hccubu/DL/" individually?

Can I please get updated SOW?

comment: Jun,

Do you mean if the following two files are part ofHCCU_DL_MMDDYY.zip.pgp?
 * Standard_CP_Coverage_Compliance_Mail_Report-YYYYMMDD_Final.csv.pgp
 * Extended_CP_Coverage_Compliance_Mail_Report-YYYYMMDD_Final.csv.pgp

Yeah, wondering if it's in the zip or sent individually.

Or is this a new/separate application?

comment: [~dawnl]: In addition to [~jun]'s comment, we need a new AppNo & VID from PC team since this is going to be treated as a new application. Please provide this deliverable so that we can continue this project.

We are still pending updated SOW so we need this before coding; Timeline will be voided if we don't have this. Please have this to us by EOD Monday, 4/11/2022

comment: Will - I have discussed with Jessica, since thisdirect mail quarterly courtesy pay letters is a new application set up (not part ofHCCU_DL), it will needgothrough HCCU account manager Gary Marshall for pricing and the IM for setup. TS #25843 has been turned over to Gary.

comment: Hi [~dawnl],

This project is holding for a while.

I will remove from developer resource list, if we don't have any action within one week from now.

Developer will not reinitiate project until we setup new timeline.

Please let me or Peter know if we need to restart the project.

Thanks

comment: Hi [~dawnl],

Just FYI. I removed from resource schedule. We can just leave as "hold" for this Story.

But we will need new timeline when client wants to resume this project.
Because the developer may busy with other projects.

Please let [~Peter.Dang] or me know when client wants to resume project.
Thanks
Tun

Here is the update from Gary "Temporarily closing until client is ready".

I have discussed with Jessica, we can just close this out. Since the work was not done, we will just cancel.

Thanks.
