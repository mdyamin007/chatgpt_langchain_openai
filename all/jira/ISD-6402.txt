I think you should be able to post:

on Staging.

comment: Escrow used to have automatic emails. Since this project involved switching escrow from afp to doc, we also needed to update a flag for automatic emails to remain in effect. I've enabled it on production now so that DP doesnt have to manually trigger these every time.
