The 'Gary Wagers' signature block is also replaced with 'Dotti Price' as outlined by client here[^Dotti Price signature block.docx]

Attached IS checklist [^BANBDL027_is-533_check_list.pdf].

I believe all updates have been completed for this ticket. The client would like all applications that have the old 'Gary Wagers' signature block replaced with the new one, but I think this update will apply to just daily letter 027 for now and a separate ticket will be created for the others due to the change in scope/amount of work necessary.

Discussed with Sam since we have confirmed with client already to update all application to replace Gary Wagers signature instead of just daily letter 027. Sam will update when he has more info, thanks!

It looks like daily letter 027, the sample provided, is the only BANB letter or application with the old 'Gary Wagers' signature block. Please confirm with client.
