title: 16114 - SLCU - Checking afp/pdf file sizes
description: We encountered some file size discrepancies for SLCU with the PDFs generated from AFP2WEB.

For example, here is what we found with this file for acct 0008911115: slcumv2_11302020_0008911115_29413.afp
 * This afp file is about 30Kb. When IS converted it, the pdf size turned out to be around 478Kb. When pulling this statement from the admin site, its roughly 1Mb.
 * When we searched for that same afp file on the afp2web servers, it was also around 30Kb.
 * When we gave the afp file on our server to IS for conversion, the resulting pdf still turned out around 478Kb.
 * Resource file sizes matched the ones provided by IS.
 * IS uses afp2web.ini while we use afp2web_transparent.ini



Please compare the ini file between IS and ISD to see if there is any difference that may impact the file size.

comment: # I tried to pull the pdf directly from afp2web server with the same afp file (32KB ) I got a pdf with 1.1MB. I used the following link to do it:
 ** [http://ca-afp2web-pr-01.infoimageinc.com:8040/services/testtransform.html]
 ** remember to put the ini file path in there (i.e: /mnt/resource/ini-prod/afp2web_transparent.ini)
 # Also, when I pulled the pdf from wrapperservice it's 1.1MB

So, looks like whatever afp2web is returning the wrapper is returning exactly that
