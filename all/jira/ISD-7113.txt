This job has estmt sent as an attachment in email instead of posting. I've attached the sample email here for review.

comment: Hi [~eric.yan]

I found that wrong image is attached on Jira so that the resource file I uploaded is not right.
I converted the new pseg again so here is the new resource file:[^S1MIDJPT.300]

FYI, [~berezinez] [~nprimak]
