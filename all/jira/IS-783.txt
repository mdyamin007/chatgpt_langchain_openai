comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]this is to be added on to Daily Letter A. I did not see any new changes to the SOW. Please advise what the letter code should be. Currently Daily Letter A is 001-027 and Daily Letter B is 028-042, so is this to be letter code 043?


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~yameelee]- I added to the end of the job list. See letter 321. Is that ok? Or do you want me to move up to under the Stratis letters? We could use letter code 043 since it's not being used. Let me know.

Natalie, this story is a part of the implementation project for FFIN, and as you know, QA is involved after the client approves the sample.
So I'm assigning the story status back to "In Progress."

Also wanted to note that since there's only one account, testing is limited so we can't guarantee that it will work in production.
