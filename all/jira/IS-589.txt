comment: [~nischala.manjunath]the banner page was not included. Please see ticket 23951.

comment: [~kericapote], we do have a cover page for every statement. Does the client think the banner page is something different? We're including the text in white to the cover page of every statement. It's right next to the logo and can't be seen because it is white text.

If they want to change the color to black so they can see the text, let me know. It will look like this (we'll have to change the position if so) -

comment: [~nischala.manjunath] MSBK needs to see the identifier on the banner page. Can we have it show black on the archive but not print on the paper?

comment: [~kericapote] - I changed the first page of every account/statement to text based as discussed. Updated archival sample is attached -  [^msbk_dn1_PDFNotices_archival_10042021.zip]

comment: [~nischala.manjunath] MSBK says:

{color:#1f4e79}I do see that the first page is a text-based PDF, and the rest are not. It did allow me to see and setup parameters, but I cant get them to load properly. I opened a case with our vendor, hopefully it is something simple that I missed.{color}

comment: [~nischala.manjunath] MSBK says:



{color:#1f4e79}OK, good news, with the assistance from support I was able to get the notices into our cold storage system. The bad news is, the ***BP is showing on the first page for each customer. I apologize for that, I apparently mis-understood, I thought it would be on the first page only.{color}

{color:#1f4e79}The concern is that if a notice must be printed off for a customer, what they would have originally received is different from the notice we would print from Synergy.{color}

{color:#1f4e79}Can something like the ATTACHED be done? {color}
 # A separate (one) page with the banner as a text-based PDF in black
 # Keep everything else as is (keeping the first page for each customer as text based), except change the first page of each notice from black to white?

{color:#1f4e79}{color}

{color:#1f4e79}My concern is if we dont keep the first page for each customer as text based, employees will not be able to search for a customer.{color}

{color:#1f4e79}{color}

{color:#1f4e79}Amanda, would you agree with this?{color}

{color:#1f4e79}{color}

{color:#1f4e79}The good news, once we get it, it will be set for any other reports that need to be set the same way.{color}

Thank you.
However, I do not see the individual file naming convention
