comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] [~ratnam] Sean is out today, but I talked to David and we cannot support multiple enotice tabs at this time. Even if we were to agree on supporting this in the future, we would need an enhancement request submitted so that we can assess the feasibility and work effort. 

For now, we would have to go with posting the notices all under their existing enotices tab and as usual that would consist of configuring any new enotice index file prefixes along with new letter codes/descriptions. This also means we do not need to change anything to the bounceback report, since it should pull everything under the enotices type.

If you have any further concerns regarding additional enotice tabs, please escalate to Sean/David. Thanks.

The index file is posted on staging, dle_20220607_1_20220607_0957_sefc.txt

But I would need a list of letter code and letter description so that it would display the letter names proplerly.

comment: [~eric.yan]FYI
 1. there is no letter code 302 for ARM Notices

 2. #bug (ARM (intial)) - When you want to view a document, you expect to see "Initial", but actual - "Subsequent"

comment: [~Andrey.Kutsenko] I believe ARM notices is part of a separate jira story, ISD-6853, which is assigned to Azhar on our DSI team. 

As for the initial rate notice, are you seeing Subsequent Rate notice content for other accounts too? If that's the case, then we need to let the IS programmer know so they can verify on their end.


author: JIRAUSER11100
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] - ARM notices are assigned to DSI. Since Eric is the one who set up this I just want to clarify this. I see 3 links when I enter the account number (1706063657 - initial) Notice of APR increase, Initial notice and another Initial notice. And the same initial statement is posted in all 3. And when I checked the account number (1705925080 - subsequent) again I see 3 links - Notice of APR increase, Initial notice and Subsequent notice. The same subsequent notice is posted in all 3. Should there be 3 links? 

Thanks!


author: JIRAUSER11100
comment: [~Andrey.Kutsenko] - The account you are looking at is subsequent notice only. But it's posted under both initial and subsequent notice.
