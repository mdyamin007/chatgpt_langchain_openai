Can you provide the list of possible cif number that has special characters for DACB?

Thanks

I have committed the code in the trunk and deployed on the pilot. Take a look and let me know.

Thanks.

This fix is working for the personal accounts but not when we try to sso in as the business user/subuser.From the infoservice logs (2020-09-04 16:32:07), I tried to pass in cif:SM P&00#00|7777 but it did not encode properly and came out withprimaryUserId: SM P. There is an index file posted on pilot PUI 8/13 you can get some cifs from there. Let include testing other characters like right parenthesis ( and forward slash / .

[08/13/2020 12:56:10] AcctNum: [750000244] Cif: [PATTER&P00]



Thanks,

I have committed the change in the trunk and deployed in the pilot. Let me know when you check.

I have one concern aboutPrimary_user_flag column in the usr_mapping table.

Currently when we sso with sub user then it insert "S" otherwise it insert "null" inPrimary_user_flag column. Is it following the current business?



Thanks,

I have build your code on pilot. I also noticed that too about the primary_user_flag, and I am unsure. I was getting either null or 'S'. It appears to work withprimary_user_flag = 'N'. So far the CIF *cannot* accept percent sign or underscore.

Thanks,

Joe confirmed the primary_user_flag is working as business logic.

I have tried to log in with "_" underscore in the CIF number and it's working. But "%" will not work because of some cookie issues.

And I have also check for CIF number with "%" in the DACB index file and there is no CIF number with "%".



Thanks,
