comment: Hi [~anwarh] ,

Please see my comment above, also, the client has asked: Can you use these data files for the final samples. These are the updated data files that will reflect a $0 NSF fee? We just want to make sure that these letters will still send out even if there is a $0 NSF fee and the letter wont be suppressed."

Files are attached to comment 55 in ticket 31269; one is too large to attached to this story.

comment: Hi [~kdishroon], 
Latest samples are in: ac-secure-share/dsi_print/anwarH/mfcu_dlis_1538

$0 NSF fees don't affect suppression. But without any valid transactions, it will be suppressed.
The missing fields client mentioned were for those. 
I've put the actual print sample too: mfcudl_129_130_132_print.pdf

Thanks,
Anwar

comment: Hi [~anwarh],



See the client's response below; they would like to know what is the criteria for a "valid transaction"?

comment: [~anwarh],

For the NSF notices (129, 130, and 132), they want to show $0 if the fee is $0.



Overdraft Transfer fee from $4 to $0
 * I need to confirm that we currently do not send notices if a transfer did not generate a fee? I believe that this statement is correct.
 * We do NOT need to send notices when a transfer occurs.

NSF fee from $29 to $0
 * We will want to send notices even if they are $0 fee

Over limitFee from $29 to $0
 * We will want to send notices even if they are $0 fee

Regarding members who are labeled as "Ineligible" we want verify that you guys are able to make this clear on your end on the letter. It can either be a grey box, a check box with some text saying this member is ineligible or just simple text with the word"Ineligible".



Also please ensure that all notices have an updated code date of "10/22".



Thank you,

{code}
As you can see, there are no "EXC: 000" to begin with.
 and
 The two "NSF:" line's "DESC:" values must be matched exactly. Our program is case-sensitive. 
 and
 The 2nd "DETAIL1:" line's "AVAIL:" can't be empty. (The last available balance)

Note: "DESC:" match logic is only applicable for print, not e-statement.

The example client sent us didn't have a matching "DESC:" value.
 There is no FEES logic in place.
h2. Letter 129

From our mapping doc:

If EXC (DETAIL2 pos 25-27) = 000, 306 or 370 AND SLIDT (DETAIL1 pos 43) = 0 Then use this template
 and
 The two "NSF:" line's "DESC:" values must be matched exactly. Our program is case-sensitive. 
 and
 "FEES:" can't be 0 (We can remove this based on the request)
 and
 The 2nd "DETAIL1:" line's "AVAIL:" can't be empty. (The last available balance)

Note: "DESC:" match and "FEES" logic is only applicable for print, not e-statement.
h2. Letter 131


 If EXC (DETAIL2 pos 25-27) = 306 or 370 AND SLIDT (DETAIL1 pos 43) = 1 Then use this template

No FEES based logic in place.
