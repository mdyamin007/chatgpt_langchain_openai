title: JEF#44517 HFCU daily notice update release code are in BB RHS xfer folder 
description: There was a JEF#44517. Somehow which I have not released the code. However, we found the code on BB RHS xfer folder. Not sure if this was synced at the time the code reside on this server. The strange thing is that these code have not released to production, but no longer in RHS menlo xfer folder.

comment: [~Peter.Dang]: Thanks for reporting the issue.  Per our discussion, the only reason why Rony's code was in the Brisbane Transfer folder was because it was at one period of time in Menlo transfer folder. The sync program only syncs from Menlo to Brisbane which is one way. Sync means making a "copy" of the files to Brisbane.

My assumption here is that the files may have inadvertently been deleted from Menlo transfer folder before you can release the code.



I'm going to close this ticket for now as I believe this is non-brisbane related item. However, if there is another reported issue, please let me know.
