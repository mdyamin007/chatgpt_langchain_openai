title: UTCU - [22655][pvt] Stmt Hyperlink removal request /  Non-Billable
description: UTCU - Stmt Hyperlink removal request
Per Tomas / Trisha, this request will be waived.
TO: 11/11
Pilot: 11/22
Live: 11/29

Remove the check hyperlink(check images) in the eStatement
* Update to afp2web_transparent.ini in wrapperservice properties in */wrapperservice* and in */wrapperservice-test* on gitlab (and everything else for consistency) -- wrapperservice-pr01/02 success, 03/04 failed but seems like these instances are not being used. Verified on production infotrac, no server restart necessary.
* Update web.xml in utcu prism code --released

Note: Server-configs-Dev covers all lower environment. Check ca-wrapper-dv-01/02

PerUTCU whenthey hover over the check number, it will turn pale yellow. When they click on and it takes me to a broken hyperlink.

comment: [~barnetts] the check hyperlink should be removed now on pilot. Please have the client verify on infotrac pilot with acct 449670, it should have a check# 236 that is no longer clickable.

UTCU approves of the samples.

Thanks, Barnett

comment: Thanks [~barnetts], I'll move my updates to stage and pass it to QA once I'm ready.

comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid], I removed check links within the statements on stage. Can you have someone verify on both InfoTRAC stage and SSO stage?

InfoTRAC:
Search acct 449670 in the account management tab and open the 10/31 monthly stmt.
In page 2, there should be a check #236. It should no longer be clickable.

SSO:
Use acct 449670, the prefilled info can be used. 
Open up the 10/31 monthly stmt and check that check #236 is no longer clickable on page 2.

comment: [~barnetts] There is no parallel required, therefore I think I can actually release this sooner than 11/29. Is it ok if I release this to production tomorrow?


author: barnetts
comment: Hi [~Shun.Kuwashima],

Please release this as soon as you are able to since parallel is not required.

Thanks, Barnett

comment: [~barnetts] This is released onto production. I verified on infotrac prod myself and I am no longer able to click on the check number.
