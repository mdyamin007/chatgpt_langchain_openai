title: FCBT - [26898][pvt] Replacing Logo and Color Matching: AGFC
description: Total 20 IS hrs - 5hrs for each sub CID (another 6hrs if we have to modify data files)

4 ISD hours to export and test.



I believe we can have 3 IS JIRAs for 3 IS programmers.



1.There are no production files for all subCIDs except AGFC Simple Statement and Funds Held. Can we get data files from client or else we have to use CTFC data files to modify for these subCIDs.If we have to modify CTFC data files to use, it will be extra 6 hours.

2. Will we be using psegs or tiff for these logos. For CTFC, we have to use tiffs to match the colors. Or do we have to test for both to see which matches the colors best?



Samples will be approved by Melisa Atkinson at FCBT - we will need to ship physical copies. 1 application set per CID is fine (not all applications need to be shipped).



Timeline

Turnover to IS 7/1

QA samples 7/18

client samples 7/20

client approval 7/25

parallel 7/26

LIVE 7/29



Programmers:

Jason - LQ2 & LQ3

Rukmani - DLA & ML1

Tevis - LQ1 & LS1



IS assessments:

Create logo resources for all 4 images

The whole application will go to 1 person to update all 4 logos so not 4 people work on one application for each logo.

comment: [~MattL] - Any update on the daily and ml1 data file? Can you please change the live date?

Thanks!

comment: Hi [~rukmaniR],

We only need to update AGFC. We should already be receiving their production file. We can use their most recent file for samples.


author: JIRAUSER11100
comment: [~MattL] - I found only one AGFC data file which we received in july for daily and I'm using it. For ML1 there is no data file for AGFC in the production backup folder, I see only for AGTX. Please advice.

Thanks!

comment: Hi [~rukmaniR]AGTX = AGFC



Please use AGTX files for AGFC


author: JIRAUSER11100
comment: [~MattL] - Are we changing the logo for AGTX too? In the dfa they are set as 2 different CIDs.

Thanks!


author: JIRAUSER11100
comment: [~MattL] - If AGTX logo has to be changed, please confirm that it uses the same logo as AGFC.

Thanks!

comment: AGTX is AGFC.



FCBT sends AGFC's files with "AGTX" instead.

Exported the latest dfa to qa folder.
Attached the pdf sample to JIRA. 

I had to rename the following dfa's since the one in the qa folder is owned by Dsi and not able to overwrite.
FCBTDL003_1267.zip
FCBTDL004_1267.zip
FCBTDL004_1267.zip

Thanks!
