comment: Hi [~Andrey.Kutsenko],

The 'Agree' and 'Cancel' buttons were implemented as previous business. For 'pre_enroll' users I implemented 'Agree' and 'Disagree' buttons.

Now I did sync those buttons with previous implementation. So, now will show 'Agree' and 'Cancel' buttons for all steps.

Thanks!

comment: Hi [~sahossain],
In this example (USR_ID ='29924145') is the 'pre_enroll' USER. 
Why is there no 'Disagree' button on the Enrollment - Step 2 of 3 (see screenshot)? 
+The entire tab is closed+ if you press the 'Cancel' button.

1. In this example (USR_ID ='29924145') is the 'pre_enroll' USER: You will see 3 steps of enrollment because user SSO is null which means the user didn't enroll yet. Probably somehow SSO date was added "null" manually or status added 'pre_enroll' in usr_session table.

2. Please ignore the 'Disagree' button, I replaced it into the 'Cancel' button. So now you will see 'Agree' & 'Cancel' button.

3. The entire tab is closedif you press the 'Cancel' button: Yes it was a previous business for a new user. When a user goes through 3 steps of enrollment that time if the user click on 'Cancel' button in step 2 of 3 then closed the entire tab. But for the 'pre_enroll' user, if they click on the 'Cancel' button they will redirect to the statement page.

For your given user credentials where sess_active_status is 'pre_enroll' but SSO date is null that's why goes through 3 steps of enrollment and it behaves as new user. When you click on the 'Cancel' button in steps 2 of 3 then close the entire tab as new user logic.

*'pre_enroll' user* means they must have SSO date and sess_active_status='pre_enroll'. But your provided credentials where the SSO date is null.

*New user means* they don't have SSO date whatever they have sess_active_status.


||Case||Expected behavior||
|SSO date is null, whatever about sess_active_status|Go through 3 steps of enrollment, In step 2, if click on the 'Agree' button then redirect to the next page.|
|SSO date is null, whatever about sess_active_status|Go through 3 steps of enrollment, In step 2, if click on the 'Cancel' button then closed the entire tab.|
|Have SSO date and sess_active_status='pre_enroll'|Shows the disclosure document page, if click on the 'Agree' button update sess_status_active='active' and redirect to the statement page. They will not see the disclosure again when they log in next time.|
|Have SSO date and sess_active_status='pre_enroll'|Shows the disclosure document page, if click on the 'Cancel' button does not update sess_active_status and redirect to the statement page. They will see the disclosure again when they log in next time.|
|Have SSO date and sess_active_status='active'|Direct redirect to the statement page.|
|Have DSO date and sess_active_status='pre_enroll'|Shows token recovery page, after enter the zip code redirect to the disclosure document page. If click on the 'Agree' button update sess_status_active='active' and redirect to the statement page. They will not see the disclosure again when they log in next time.|
