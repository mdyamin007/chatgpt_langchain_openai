Hi Rukmani, I assigned this to Yamee and this was never reassigned to you, my apologies on the delay. Is it possible to provide update to client with samples and a new live date? Thank you.

comment: [~Bryanl] - I see "***Hold - Route to Loan Servicing*** in the data file. Right now there is no logic to suppress this in the program. How do you want this handled?

Thanks!


author: JIRAUSER11100
comment: [~Bryanl] - Hold - Route to Loan Servicing is suppressed in PLBKDNP21.dfa but not in PLBKDNP11.dfa


author: JIRAUSER11100
comment: [~Bryanl] - The new live date is 08/01 if you can respond to my question today. 

Thanks!


author: bryanl
comment: Hi [~rukmaniR]

client response was:

The suppression logic for ***Hold - Route to Loan Servicing*** should be the same as in PLBK_LONWRD. Those notices should be sent to us through the FTP in a zip file (sample attached), and an email is sent to us to alert us that a file is ready for pickup. Can we mirror that from the LONWRD program?

Client attached the following file as well:

[plbk_pdfdn_hold_loan_notices_07222022_1.zip|https://app.na3.teamsupport.com/dc/1/attachments/15455339]

Please let me know new live date thanks!

QA is completed,"***Hold - Sold Loan***"*added to suppression logic  *(same as "***Do Not Mail***")


author: JIRAUSER11100
comment: [~Bryanl] - plbkdna1255.nop is the sample file for "Hold -Sold Loan" suppression. I have attached the file "plbk_pdfdn_hold_loan_notices_07252022_1.pdf" which gets zipped and placed in the client pickup. Since I couldn't find any latest data file to test "Hold - Route to Loan Servicing" I have used an old L495WD test file from May.

Thanks!

Per client:

These look good, but just to confirm, we're adding the suppression logic for ***Hold - Sold Loan*** as well as suppression logic for ***Hold - Route to Loan Servicing***, correct? I didn't see any notices with the ***Hold - Sold Loan*** verbiage, so I just want to be sure.


author: JIRAUSER11100
comment: [~Bryanl] - ***Hold - Sold Loan*** gets suppressed from printing and it's in the .nop file that I have attached, there's no sample for it. ***Hold - Route to Loan Servicing*** is sent back to the client as pdf. They have different suppression logic.

Thanks!

comment: [~rukmaniR]

Client said this correct and it okay with it. Can we still do 8/2 live date? Thank you!
