comment: Hi [~phoebe.george], any feedback on this?


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~anwarh] Sorry I missed this! I will need to request an index file for ISD to post to pilot site so that the customer can review it. Unfortunately, they will not be able to view on staging. Can you provide the index file pilot, and will request ISD to load today? Thanks!

[~eric.yan] FYI.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~anwarh] Are you able to still create an index file for ISD to post to pilot so customer can review for approval? Thanks!


author: anwarh
comment: [~phoebe.george], should be posted now in pilot, Please check. Thanks


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~anwarh] [~eric.yan] I'm not able to see the accounts on pilot InfoTrac based on the accounts I found in pilot PUI list.

[~eric.yan] Are you able to see these in pilot? Thanks!

The index file 'ms2_20220428_1_20220428_2041_sucu.txt' was already processed on both pilot and staging.

On pilot I don't see CC pdf statements for accounts from processed index file, on Staging I see CC statements.

Thank you,

Natasha

I don't see any updates about Pilot since Thursday, releasing the story from QA, because staging has pdf statements for Credit card for accounts from provided index file.

Thank you,

Natasha
