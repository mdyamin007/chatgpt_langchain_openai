title: ftpbu-stage Windows
description: [~hesham.hanna] and [~kent.chan]: Per our brisbane meeting, you will be create a cloned windows ftpbu-stage instance for David to install the FTPBU scanner.



Look like you created a record on brisbane server list:

!image-2020-09-08-14-12-22-148.png!





Can you confirm that it is fully setup? 



Here is the source server IP that you need to open up as well, but I believe by default since it is in the same subnet, all ports are open. Just to be on the safe side, here it is:

comment: [~hesham.hanna]: Per our brisbane all today, can you work on setting up this ftpbu stage windows server? This is so that Tai can help install a stage/parallel version of the FTPscaneer.



[~davidt], [~tai.trinh] and [~kent.chan]: FYI.

comment: [~davidt]: Can you confirm that RDP works? That was the last reported issue that Kent just corrected earlier.


author: william.kong
comment: [~davidt]: Please advise status on this ticket. Was the access issue fixed from Network?  Last verbal update on Thursday was that this is pending Network to open up so that you and your team can set it up.

comment: Kent, Per our discussion, please open RDP access.

Thanks

comment: [~kent.chan]: I'm going to assign this to Prem if you don't mind now that I know this RDP access is still pending.



[~premraj.patil]: Can you assist on this one also? going to re-assign this ticket to you.


author: william.kong
comment: [~premraj.patil]: Can you review this item today? I really need David to get working on this system.


author: william.kong
comment: [~davidt]: Per Prem, he said this issue was resolved yesterday and you should have access. Please advise if you or Tai will be working on the FTPscanner. I thought i heard you would be taking care of it this morning (i think...). If not, can you please re-assign this ticket.



Thanks!

Please provide the path for your Stage FTP and BU location. I tried ca-rhstore-pr-01.infoimageinc.com but don't have the login ID and password.

Thanks

comment: Kent/Prem,

Please also provide access for this server to ca-input-dv-01 so that I can place file there. I don't know the port but it for mounting.

Also, I need access to mailer-instant.infoimage port 25 to send email notification.



Thanks
 David

comment: [~davidt]: The script user account is active. I tested earlier today and it works. Can you share the error message on why you can't ssh [script@ca-rhstore-pr-01.|mailto:script@ca-rhstore-pr-01.%C2%A0] I also checked the /etc/exports and the ca-ftpbu-sg-01 server has been there; I'm going to re-export again just to be on the safe side.  See below for my /etc/exports dump

If you agree the exports looks right, then please assign this ticket back to Prem if you still need the previous comment addressed.

comment: William,


Couple thing I want to clarify. The server that I am user is ca-ftpbu-st-01. Your email said {color:#de350b}sg{color} rather than {color:#de350b}st{color}. I accessing both your stage (ca-rhstore-st-01, ca-rhstore-sg-01) and prod (ca-rhstore-pr-01) and got prompted for user and password. I used script user with both the m and 3 password but getting the wrong password message.

Since this is the Stage's Scanner, please also confirm with rhstore that I should mount to.

comment: Looks like you need CIFS access instead. 

*For Stage CIFS access to ca-rhstore-sg-01 using script user:*

!image-2020-09-17-12-21-39-584.png!



*For Production CIFS access to ca-rhstore-pr-01 using oper1 user, I don't see any current eStatement usage in Menlo; Only usage is for /d/ops for Operations department. So I didn't create any additional folders:*

Please let me know if there are any other specific folders that you need access to that I'm missing.

comment: William,

I am able to access your stage server now but still running into other restriction that need Network Team to open before I can run it.



Kent/Prem:  Please open access from the list below to ca-ftpbu-st-01.

+Destination:+

ca-oracle-pr-01 - Port 1521

ca-oracle-dv-01 - Port 1521 (I know this server is not ready but please add it ahead of time if you can).

ca-input-dv-01 - Port 2049 (CIFS) I believe this is the right port

ca-pui-st-01 - Port 8888, 80

mailer-instant - Port 25



Thanks

David

comment: ca-oracle-pr-01 - Port 1521: DONE

ca-oracle-dv-01 - Port 1521 : DON't HAVE ASSIGN IP SO CANNOT CREATE RULE

ca-input-dv-01 - Port 2049 (CIFS) DONE

ca-pui-st-01 - Port 8888, 80: DONE . (what is port 888?, it was not standard define port)

mailer-instant - Port 25: DONE (10.4.12.202 is the mailer-instant VIP, in case you want to cross check, that's the right server you want to connect)



Thanks,

comment: Prem,

Can you double check? I still got the following error for oracle and input. When I try P-UI, I got blank screen. mailer-instant seem to work.

comment: William,

The Scanner is running and I also schedule to run every 5 minutes. I have some issue with FTPS4_stage so not sure if something wrong with that folder and if possible create a new one for testing. I didn't test email notification or your auto trigger yet as I am still waiting or database and P-UI. For now you can put file and it will scan to get the file ID.



Thanks

David
