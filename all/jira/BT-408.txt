comment: Hi [~Andrey.Kutsenko]

I've tried doing sso on stage for EPCU and did not encounter any error.

Here is the sso configuration for EPCU on Stage:
{code:java}
{
    "type":"singlesignon",
    "password":"!epcu@2013",
    "hashMethod":"MD5",
    "userAutoCreate":true,
    "accountAutoCreate":true,
    "checkPrimaryUser":false,
    "removeUFA":false,
    "updateEmail":true,
    "clientCode":"00006644"
}
{code}
Here, you can see that EPCU is configured to create new account if not created already. So any account number you passed through sso, will not cause any error. So this could not be the issue for your sso attempt failing.

As you did not pass me any other information or screenshot of your issue, I can only speculate. My guess is that, your request to ssoKeyGen url is failing.

Can you access the heartbeat url for epcustage? Please try to hit this url:
{code:java}
https://epcustage.infoimageinc.com/heartbeat
{code}
If you get an "OK" status then you are good. If not, please try the following -

Could you please check if your hosts file has the following entry? hosts file location on Windows is*C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts*
{code:java}
10.5.16.147         epcustage.infoimageinc.com
{code}
If this entry is not present, please add it and then try again.

Let me know if this issue still persists.
