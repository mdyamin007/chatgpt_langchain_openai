comment: [~anil.dasa]Can you provide a confirmation on the pilot for this to confirm if it was enabled last week? Or are you starting this week?


author: anil.dasa
comment: [~phoebe.george]I did not enable it. I saw comment for hours on this ticket. No further update. Do you want me to add this on pilot today?


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~anil.dasa] Yes, thank you - please enable when you have it ready. Can you start off with just CID FCBT and CAFC for now? We have one user that wants to test it out up front. Thanks!



[~Juliana Vannik] FYI

comment: [~phoebe.george]I am facing some issue enabling MFA for FCBT. I have emailed our offshore team to look into this. Will update you on this.

comment: [~phoebe.george] I see CAFC client has MFA enabled already. Below image shows same.

comment: [~Tin.Chak] For this MFA update, do we need to release the MFA in production for all 13 CID's at the same time? Or as associations/CID's approve the MFA, can we enable each one at different times (within a specific time period, like 2 weeks, etc).?

Thanks!

comment: [~phoebe.george] We can enable each CID at different times.
