title: ETABoard - Create Job Profile Feature
description: DataTRAC Web application will no longer be active prior to the Brisbane Move. There is a feature called "Job Profile" that IS Department uses to bridge the CID/AppNo/JID w/ the PC database and the IS database.



We have agreed to migrate and develop this feature into the ETABoard. The following is the current screenshots of the existing DataTRAC Web - Job Profile feature:

comment: [~davidt]: Can you attach the original DataTRAC Web - Job Profile source code that you extracted last Friday. Once you are done, please re-assign ticket to Terrence.



[~Terrence.Tong]: Per our conversation on Thursday, please review the code to see if you can plug it into the tomcat instance of ETABoard. If not, please develop the feature via PHP. This need to be developed an completed by 2nd week of April. I would suggest deploying this logic into Menlo Park server so that we can have it live first and sync the code to the Brisbane instance of the ETABoard.
