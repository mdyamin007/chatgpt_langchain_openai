title: 4570 - GULF - Android force enrollment PDF to open?
description: Joe asked me to get in contact with you about this as he believes there was another client requesting the same things and it may have already been added to production.

Is there an option to force open the enrollment pdf document on an Android device even though a standard pdf reader is not installed? This is a big issue for their members and the CU is receiving at least one call per day with complaints.  They are having to force enroll some of their members into the program which puts them out of compliance with the REGs.
