comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] Can you assist to load this index file to pilot site:

ms1_20210831_1_20211210_0251_sucu.txt

Also, attached is the updated resources to load.

comment: [~phoebe.george] looks like these resources were uploaded a couple months ago, is it ok to replace them with the ones you provided?

Also I've posted the index file successfully onto pilot, so I guess we can also check the statements on pilot to see if the resources need updating.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] thanks for verifying - yes, please replace just in case, if that's okay. There were a few different updates made to the e-form, and I'm not sure how that impacted the resources, so it would best to replace.

Thank you!

comment: [~phoebe.george] thanks, I've replaced the resources.

comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] DSI requested if you can use the "transparent" option for e-posting. If you need to re-post, can you take down the previous version? Thanks!!

comment: [~phoebe.george] I've enabled transparent mode for sucu on lower environments and reposted the index file, although I'm not sure I see any difference. 


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] thanks, I have notified DSI to research and fix.

comment: Hi [~Shun.Kuwashima]

I am not sure if the transfer mode is activated correctly cause here, after converting pdf we can the box. See the below snap. Left one is afp and right one is pdf converted with transparent mode on.

And the log shows the transparent mode.

Hi [~Peter.Dang], would it be possible to help here?



Thanks

comment: [~rony]& [~tanmay]: On the DFA level, are we drawing background pink color within the box or is it using a PSEG resource. If I look at your screenshot below in Papyrus, it looks like the DFA is not explicitly showing the pink background color so I'm leaning towards the issue that the DFA is the issue.



Also, Peter noticed the "TRANSACTION" box does not have the grey solid color as well. Please advise how the DFA is coded and if it is explicitly drawing the background color or using a PSEG image.

comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima]: Can you double-check one more time that your settings is using Transparency Mode in your AFP2WEB?






author: william.kong
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima]: Just a reminder, can you confirm today that you double-checked that transparency is turned on?


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~William.Kong] Yeah I checked and I have sucu set to use afp2web_transparent.ini on all lower environments, which is the file we set to enable Transparency. Is there perhaps any additional resource I need to upload?


author: william.kong
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima]: There is no additional resources. We used our own AFP2WEB server to convert with transparency and it is fine. Can you escalate this up to Tai/David to double-check why it doesn't work on your version of the AFP2WEB?

I ran with PKEY=TRANSPARENT and it worked.

/home/master/afp2pdf.py direct InputFilename=/d/iss/willK/sucums1_20210831_74500002_51.afp OutputFilePath=/d/iss/willK/ PKEY=TRANSPARENT



I ran it without TRANSPARENT and it did not work.



I've attached the afp file i used and the two pdf results:sucums1_20210831_74500002_51.zip




author: william.kong
comment: In addition, the reason why no addition resources is needed is because I download the PDF from eStatement pilot via InfoTRAC and edited the PDF. I deleted the background logo page. When I did that I was able to see the pink box and grey box:'

comment: [~William.Kong] [~phoebe.george] I can see those boxes filled in now. Turns out I did not deploy the correct jobs on dev, really sorry about that. Here's some accounts to check on Infotrac pilot:

74500027
74500016
74500018

comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] [~William.Kong] Thank you for researching, I checked accounts in pilot and it looks good now.

[~rony] [~tanmay] FYI.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima]- posted eStatement on pilot is approved; I've requested IS/DSI to prepare for QA as well. 

Thank you!


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~phoebe.george] Thanks, the transparency changes should have updated on all lower environments so I don't think there's anything else I need to make updates to until production release (besides verifying parallel potentially). I can make the release whenever we are all good to go.

comment: Transparency released to production.
