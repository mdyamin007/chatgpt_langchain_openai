title: 12110 - FCSB - Tax Accounts Enhancement and One-Time Script
description: # Enhance Auth File also to set SS accounts to Electronic automatically if there is at least one other account linked to the user that is on Eletronic ("E")
 # One time script to go through all SS accounts and perform the logic above. (There are about 4.7 millions accounts)
 # Test E-Tax emails. It was not previously set up. It seems like all accounts are on Paper anyway. However, we do need to test this to make sure everything work as intended (after running the script that would mass enroll a lot of accounts into Electronic). If any issues are found, will need to create another ticket to resolve internally by end of year.
