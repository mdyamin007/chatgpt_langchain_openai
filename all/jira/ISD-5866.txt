I've added audit_log tables in *dev*, *pilot*, *stage* and *production* for the below clients -

*cu*:secu

*default*:adfi, afcu, cfcu, clcu, eecu, pacu, prcu, spcu, uscu



Just a note, I've also found some hypercube clients that have audit_log tables in prod that don't have any data. I took the [Estatement Version List|https://app.smartsheet.com/sheets/vr3RqQQM3782WgMrrJG354v4WMXRc3RVQRR896f1?view=grid] as a reference for current clients that are in business with InfoIMAGE.
