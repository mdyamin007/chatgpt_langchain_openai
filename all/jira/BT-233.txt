comment: [~gthillaivel] Unfortunately, COLU will not be able to send a test file with the new file name. They confirmed though that their processing is following the file name noted in the SOW. Please verify if the program is setup to expect this file, but we will not be able to receive a test file with this file name from the CU for this QA test.

Thanks,

Phoebe

comment: [~gthillaivel] Actually, can you confirm if you meant 'OUTER' file, or 'OUTBOUND' files - you circled OUTER file on the SOW, but the ticket subject is 'OUTBOUND', which are the PDF archival files. 

Thanks,

Phoebe

I meant "outer " files .I will update the description

comment: [~gthillaivel] Thanks for confirming! Please just check that the program is setup to receive the outer file name in the SOW as noted in your previous comment. We will ensure the customer follows this for processing in production with the outer file name.

Thanks!

comment: [~gthillaivel] Since we wont receive these data files until the 1st. I think we should pass this ticket so we can run the parallel test.
