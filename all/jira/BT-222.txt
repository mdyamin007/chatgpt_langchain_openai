title: Incorrect mode in format step for FHNB42S
description: For the project - FHNB42S.dfa the document is formatted in SIMPLEX mode.
At the same time, when we view the document on the third page, it is indicated that this is the second page (see pdf file)

The page number indicated is taken straight from the data file. So, this should not a valid bug.

Thanks,
Sam

Okay, but we print as a simplex document and the client sees on the third page that this is the second page.
[~kdishroon] - Is the client aware of this?

Hi Andrey,

Attached sample[^fhnb42s131.sam.pdf]from running data file FHNB_1042S_11162021_0852_TEST.pgp in parallel environment.

The issue observed of there being a third page that has the verbiage "page 2" is not present in this sample. This may be an issue that has since been resolved with more recent data files as the data file used in FHNB42S.prj may be outdated.

I'll try to use this data file (FHNB_1042S_11162021_0852_TEST.pgp) in your project (FHNB42S.prj).
