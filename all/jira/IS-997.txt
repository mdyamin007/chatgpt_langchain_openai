title: SNFB [27761] [pvt] Guardian - Black Knight Conversion Post Live Update for Mortgage Statements 
description: Assessment:

1. Update Description table plus testing = 1 hour
 2. Update Transaction Activity begin date to reflect the W (historical) transactions = 1 hour

Total = 2hrs

*Update from Leo on 4/7:*
 New logic will be implemented for "New Loan" statements. This new logic will follow the below criteria:

Omit any Transaction 170 and 142 with matching dates from transaction activity. Also, do not populate Interest and Escrow in Payment History buckets if there are any 170 and 142 transactions with matching dates.

Since this will require a bit of redesign in the current logic, it will require 3 hrs of dev work on top of the 2 hrs proposed for the description and activity date updates from comment 5.

We will need Guardian to provide the new description table by tomorrow in order for client to receive samples by EOD Monday.



*Update from Leo on 4/13:*

Per our meeting with Guardian, they requested that we convert any negative transaction number into a positive number. No numbers should be coming in negative in the data file, however that is how they are being produced by Black Knight. Therefore they put in this request. This will be 1hr of dev time to implement.
