I see an issue at the bottom of the statement page - part of SLCU address is empty (see the bug).


author: JIRAUSER11700
comment: The issue is data file related so it isn't blocking this task.

The index file is processed correctly. There is no old file in the backup (its a yearly statement); but by comparison with other migrated statements I can see it has a new format.
