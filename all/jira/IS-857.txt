title: MFCU - MFCU - Member Statement Changes
description: # For member, credit card and mortgage statements, we want to center the statement on the PDFs in eStatements. On print because of the bardcoding on the left margin, the body of the statement is pushed to the right. In eStatements we want the body center on the PDF.
 # Add verbiage **Please retain this final statement for tax purposes** on any close share or loan during the period. See screen below for example. I believe you can use record 498 Closed Share Line and 598 Closed Loan Line to tell if the share/loan was closed during the period.
 # Lessen the spacing between the share summary and totals, and the dividends from last year. Spacing should be consistent for all those items.



*Updated: 2/22/2022:*

Please add FTP Trigger logic for this project as well.

Please advise, where this verbiage should be?

Add verbiage **Please retain this final statement for tax purposes**

what account has it?

I dont see it in the output.


author: tohiduli
comment: Hi [~berezinez]

share account example, account number: 12109283 (6th account of the data file mfcu_857_update.txt)
loan account example, account number: 12120224(8th account of of the data file mfcu_857_update.txt)



if 498 record exist for share account then the verbiage will print under the transaction section for that account

if 598 record exist for a loan account then the verbiage will print under the loan transaction section for that account

please advise, what verbiage should be there?

per description:Add verbiage **Please retain this final statement for tax purposes**

output displays"*Please retain this final statement for tax reporting purposes"*

*the word "reporting" should be there?*


author: andreav
comment: Diego, please advise on Alis's question above.


author: diegof
comment: I just spoke to client and the samples are good and should have the word "reporting" on there. Client made a mistake when typing out verbiage but provided a sample which contained this word.

comment: As of 2/28 @ 12pm PST, client approved the lastest updates below: 

	Run suppression logic: For non-quarter end AND non-checking shares do not print if there are no transactions.  For quarter end months print all shares regardless of transactions.  For checking shares always print regardless of month and transactions.
	If fail suppression logic, then share is not printed on the statement.
	If pass suppression logic, then print on the statement using the data from the Symitar data file.

Per William, this update is released and just pending Ethan to release the FTP Trigger.
