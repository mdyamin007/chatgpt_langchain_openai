comment: [~anil.dasa]: Is the port opened to communicate? I believe port 80 is what we are using.
Can you send us the full URL you are using and the error message you are getting so we can troubleshoot? I'll include Shail as well as i may need his help to troubleshoot.

[~William.Kong] Can some one post a job to verify if we can see job status pdfs from ca-preproc-pr-03 machine? I tried to view pdf for some of the existing jobs and script has returned no pdf found.
