title: Hypercube - Adobe download smart link
description: There is a way to set up a "smart" link where it can detect which device the user is using. If it's not mobile, we can have it be the normal download link as it is now. If it's mobile, we should send to the app store instead: Apple for iPhone, and Google Play for android.
