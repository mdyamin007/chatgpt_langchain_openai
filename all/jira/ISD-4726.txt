Final File Naming convention: [BDICentrix_20210602.csv.pgp|https://app.na3.teamsupport.com/dc/1/attachments/9697642]

Latest Data file has the following example Letter ID data:

cat BDICentrix_20210602.csv | cut -d'|' -f 38 | sort | uniq -c

1 LetterID

1 35
5 36
1 37
3 39
43 40
26 41
4 42
17 43
18 44
22 45
3 48
2 49

Missing example data for letter ID 38



The latest data file has less fields.*39 fields instead of the 87 d*ata files from the original zip file in comment comment #49 "BDICentrix_20210416115406\ With\ Mapping.csv"; This has to be corrected since mapping documents has 87 plus 3 additional fields in csv file to identify which notice type it is.



Tien already quoted the hours, but as long as client can fix the assessment above, then we should be able to send them the estimate. However, if you to provided timeline/turnover date, then I will need Peter and Tun to provide the resourcing dates for this project.



Please help summarize all the requires into one description field including he new final file naming convention "[BDICentrix_20210602.csv.pgp|https://app.na3.teamsupport.com/dc/1/attachments/9697642]" , templates, a good data file, the material specs from phoebe comment's below, and Tien's assessment.
