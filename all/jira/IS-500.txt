comment: Hi [~Peter.Dang],

*Could you please advise Jun's question in TS#22585 Comment #37?**Jun needs confirmation to proceed sample.*

I am not sure your instruction in TS#22585 Comment #12 comes from client or not.

**Jun changed theCHK_DATE[CHK_PTR] to field 49. However, the difference on the statement is that the check posting date is changed to a value that isn't a date.

Thanks,

Tun

comment: [~MattL]: [~jun]spent 1hr out of the 4 hours on this project. Normally we should bill them out the hours we've spent already. But this time around, it's only one hour and I don't want to nickel and dime this client for 1 hr.



Thanks!
