title: TKCU:  Monthly Statement:  PDF Archival Add Cleanup Logic (In-house)
description: Parallel Required: Yes (Run Paper, eStmt & PDF) to make sure all service perform without issues.



Please review the tkcu_stmt_process.sh shell script. There is a bug where the program does not clear the /d/pdf_afp/tkcu/tkcums1/pdf/ folder+before+ beginning the PDF archival program.



Also, I noticed/d/pdf_afp/tkcu/tkcums1/afp/ folder is not cleared+before+ beginning PDF archival program.



This program was written a long time ago and did not follow our standard process of clearing the directory before running pdf_archival.

comment: Cancelling this project. Business requirement requires us to keep the zip files in the folder. We also have another TKCU Jira project that will override and cancel this requirement:
