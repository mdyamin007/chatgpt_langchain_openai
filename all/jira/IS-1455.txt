Do we need to process "do not mail" also along with the "hold-mail" in pdf1 ?

Thanks


author: JIRAUSER11400
comment: [~Hamimul.Chowdhuri] [~mousumiS]-Yes, It should be the same as other KYCU applications.


author: JIRAUSER11400
comment: [~Hamimul.Chowdhuri] [~mousumiS]-SOW has been updated for nop.

Also-No PGP is needed


author: JIRAUSER11400
comment: [~mousumiS]-Per client

The archival index file has different/missing columns in it. It should be similar to our existing statement/loan bill/etc archival files and contain something like:

acct, ssn, name, doc date

Please adjust the index file to match what is being sent for those files referenced above.

comment: [~mousumiS] [~tohidulI]- !image-2022-10-17-16-02-41-501.png|width=334,height=95!  Is this a data issue on CU side. They said everything else looks good.


author: mousumis
comment: Hi [~Ricky Lopez]
I have used a dummy data to test the nop part. It is not from CU side. If data is good, then everything will be good. Except this, archival is approved? 

Thanks
