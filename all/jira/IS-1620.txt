The following block of code is added to the script (line 469 - 476):

dpvs_name="${d_dir}/daily/sefcar1/${cid}${jid}${g_segment}${cycle}.print"
if [ -e ${dpvs_name} ]; then
    echo "dpvs file: ${dpvs_name}"
    subject="SEFC Arm Notices - cycle ${cyc_no}"
    message="SEFC: Arm Notices DPVS for cycle ${cyc_no} is ready"
    python ${home_master}/master/daily_mail.py 0 "$subject" "$message" ${dpvs_maillist} "${dpvs_name$
fi

Testing method:
1. created /z/daily/sefcar1/sefcar1125.print
2. ran the script with unnecessary code commented and ran the script.
3. check if dpvs was sent to wilson.yu@infoimageinc.com
