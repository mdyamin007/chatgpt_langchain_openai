On pilot, I have updated the code and ran CAMB_AUTH_022122.txt.  The client can review on pilot and provide feedback.

The value of CUSTOMERNAME will update both the user's name and the account's name.

Regards.

Will the target live date of 03/09 be okay for the client?

Please remind the client that it is going live tomorrow.

It means there is a change in AUTH file format and the client needs to send over the newly formatted AUTH file.
