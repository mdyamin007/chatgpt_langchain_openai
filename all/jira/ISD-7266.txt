title: EWBB [pvt][29580] Update HK accumulative Report to Daily
description: Please provide programming hours/timeline for changing EWBB's current HK Acc OptOut/OptIn report to DAILY (from current monthly)

EWBB like this update to coincide with their HK eAdvice release.
Can you provide updates dates for a target 6/29 live date?
(Code release EOD on 6/28 so the first daily file starts on 6/29).
