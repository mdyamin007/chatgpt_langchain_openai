title: SURU [26923] [pvt] S3 Cloud Log Setup
description: SURU - S3 Cloud Log Setup

Create centralized log file for any S3 Cloud related transmission. This way we have an audit of all the S3 upload transmissions. Today only SURU only uses this logic, but this needs to be applied to ANY customer who uses this S3 cloud push logic.

Log file needs to contain the following informatioin:

CID:

FileNames:
 MD5 checksum of the file we are uploading

S3 Username

S3 Directory Location





The contents of the log should be something like:

{{[02/28/2022 11:16:09] [INFO] [preprocessing02] [SURU] [stage] }}
{{Starting s3sync.py: /home/test/master/s3sync.py --control_file /home/test/control/suru_s3_all.control upload /z/pdf_afp/suru/surums5/zip/suru_electricity_01262022_1_1.zip suru_electricity_01262022_1_1.zip}}

This centralized log file will need to be stored in /$d_dir/ftpbu/s3sync_log/ (If s3sync log folder does not exist, create it)

Log file naming convention should be: s3sync_MMDDYYYY.log
