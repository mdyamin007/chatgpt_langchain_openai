comment: [~SamV2021]Can you confirm that they didn't receive the email notification because these are test files?


author: JIRAUSER10906
comment: [~MattL]

That is correct. I processed the job in our test environment, which I believe will not send out any e-mail notifications to the client.

comment: Hi [~SamV2021]Per the client: we are unable to open the files sent.

comment: [~SamV2021] Sorry the correct encryption key [isinformation.systems@cambridgesavings.com.|mailto:is%C2%A0information.systems@cambridgesavings.com.] Please change to that. I provided the old one that did not work.

Those files were encrypted with the encryption key that did not work. I have placed reports encrypted with the working encryption key in client pickup.
 * camb_dda_cripple_stmt_rpt_03152022.pgp
 * camb_dda_invalid_product_type_rpt_03152022.pgp
 * CAMB_DDA_ESUP_RPT_022022.txt.pgp
 * camb_dda_suppress_invalid_ptacct_03152022.pdf.pgp

Please have the client try again.

Thanks!
