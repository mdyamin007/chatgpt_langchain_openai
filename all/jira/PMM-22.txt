description: Follow up with Phoebe to identify where they come into the addendum process.

comment: Per Phoebe:

Once the addendum is signed, the IM team gets involved. And from there, we take it through the IM process. There are some new steps for us in this process that were added though, but typically we will get involved once the addendum is signed.



Sometimes the AM will bring me in ahead of time to pre-schedule a job with a hard date, or to join in any early calls so I have an understanding of the project though while the addendum is being created.
