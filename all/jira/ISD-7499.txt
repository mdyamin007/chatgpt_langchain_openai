comment: We don't have batch download available through API for WASH which they currently have for eSite.
 What else is available on the sso site that isn't available on the API side?

**Banno would send us information for enrollment for ESI credit?
 We would have to send that enrollment information to PSCU?**

Full Service Credit Issues (Not understanding)? - Can Banno communicate with PSCU directly rather than through us.
