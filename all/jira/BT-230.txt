comment: {color:#172b4d}The control file you're looking at is for the letter 127 format step and doesn't really need to include the envelope numbers. Other control files specific to the letter number has the same variables listed. The envelope numbers 1-4 are listed in the main control file, sscudle.control and is used for the print step.{color}
