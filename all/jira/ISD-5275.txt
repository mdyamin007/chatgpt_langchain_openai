comment: [~phoebe.george], we discussed a bit over spark already but just wanted to note it here for tracking purposes. Here are the fcbt configurations for each prefix and which stmt type they are assigned to (aka which tabs they are placed under):

global.ms1=default
global.ol1=default
global.ck1=default
global.lq3=default (LIQ complex stmts)
global.ls1=default (LIQ simple stmts)
global.lq1=billing (LIQ simple bills)
global.lq2=billing (LIQ complex bills)
global.ml1=mortgage (Funds held)
global.tax=etax
global.dla=enotice (Daily notices)

LIQ simple (ls1) and complex stmts (lq3) follows the same 'default' stmt type as ms1, ol1, and ck1, and currently we can only enable AOLP for specific stmt types, not by prefix. Therefore we cannot enable AOLP for ls1 and lq3 without affecting ms1, ol1, and ck1. We can still enable AOLP as normal for the other apps (lq1, lq2, ml1, and dla) because they do not share the same stmt type with any other prefix not mentioned. Please let me know how we should proceed.

Thanks,
Shun
