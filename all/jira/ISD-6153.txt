Perhaps that account does not have statements to show for the past 18 months.

Try the account number 49464.  I have modified one of the statement's closing date to a few days after 18 months cut off.

This is ready for testing in stage.  Would it be possible to get the testing done by 01/19/2022 mid-day?

Please use either [user_fi_number: 29977, account number: 29977] or [user_fi_number: 2888666, account number: 2888666] for your testing.  Each has one statement that is within 18 months.

You can also use [user_fi_number: 29999, account number: 29999] for a case where there is no statement posted for the past 18 months.

Feel free to reach out if you need any assistance with testing.

Thanks.
Lin
