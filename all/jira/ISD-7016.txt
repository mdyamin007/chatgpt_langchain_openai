title: 28992 - EWBB - HK not showing in Batch download search list
description: HK stmt type was missing from infoconfig, however apparently issue was not happening last month. Audit log does not show hk being added to infoconfig at all before 5/6, so not sure why batch download would be working properly before. Batch download should not be reliant on infoservice configs anyway, so it's strange that this fixed the issue.

Infoconfig was implemented around 3/19, so it's possible that customers last successfully used batch download before that.
