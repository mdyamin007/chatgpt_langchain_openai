title: HFCU - ECL Processing
description: ECL Processing need to be updated to have special case for HFCU. They will use notifyPref.

select np.* from fin_account fa inner join notification_preference np on fa.acct_id = np.acct_id where acct_number = '87647' and org_id = getorgid('hfcu');
select np.* from fin_account fa inner join notification_preference np on fa.acct_id = np.acct_id where acct_number = '86812' and org_id = getorgid('hfcu');

HFCU for one account number, it can have multiple notification preference (attached to multiple users). However, all of these notification preference need to have the same email. Taking in  [^hfcu.20190809.email] , the ECL should use the NotifyManager function that search using only AcctID to obtain the notif prefs returned by the queries above. Then, update all email addresses in those notif pref to the one email address. 

E.g. for 87647, all email addresses should be the same testemail12345@gmail.com
for 86812, all email addresses should also be the same DIFFERENT@gmail.com
