Please provide an updated sow link. We need the info code for this. My assumption is we can use 024.

In other letters the header part (marked with blue) was extracted from the data files. But for this letter (024) the header part is not available in data file.
 So should it be hard-coded ?
 For account number(marked with red), masked part is kept always as 'XXXXXX' and the last 4 digits of the account number was concatenated with it. 
 Is it okay?

thanks

Please see client response below.

The header will have to be hardcoded. I am not able to add this to the text. Yes on the masked part of the account. This is how we would like the account number to appear on the notice.
