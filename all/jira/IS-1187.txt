 # Please have a look at the ending portion of the first page on the left side of the screenshot and the staring portion on the second page. They are the same. Do we need to remove the second page?
 # For paper, do we need to make the mail address blue in color?

"Can you remove the mailing address that was attached to the survey. as well as remove all of the blank pages that are displaying. I have attached the part that needs to be removed. the rest of the letter looks alright."



Note: I understand what the blank pages are. I also notified MFCU about them.

Themailing address for the survey is still showing in the latest sample.Can you please remove this mailing address that is displaying on the letter? This mailing address was attached to a survey that is now removed but the mailing address isn't.


Thanks!

comment: Sorry [~dyuen]

So the entire coupon needs to be removed. or just the Mail To: portion.

!image-2022-07-21-08-34-36-810.png!



If you can mark the portion needs to be re moved, it would be better.



Also what does it mean by 'This mailing address was attached to a survey that is now removed but the mailing address isn't.' for the last sentence of previous message?



[~rumanb]



Thanks

comment: Hi [~rony] [~rumanb], MFCU responded with the following:

"Yes, Sorry for the confusion. When I open the sample file the first page is correct. On the second page there is a mailing address on the bottom of the page and it is labeled "Auto lending survey" on the side. The mailing address on that page is what needs to be removed. In doing so if this creates a blank page then we would also like that removed"
