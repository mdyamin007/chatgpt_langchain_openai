title: UFCU - Update to Archival for Escrow Analysis
description: *Parallel Requirement*: No



From Diego:
 The use of the xfer file is new only to monthly statements. For other applications you will simply need to pull the last fields(along with the other items we already pull from xfer) which are new in the xfer file Field 21 == email address and 22 = SalesforceID

This changes the index we output from:

DocCode,MemberNum,MemberName,StatementDate, path/filename,statement name,delivery preference,YES

TO:

DocCode,MemberNum,MemberName,StatementDate, path/filename,statement name,delivery preference,YES,email,SalesforceID

For monthly statement we will need to read in the file and match up the account number to field1 of the xfer and pull those 2 fields above.

Just confirming now the actual order of the 2 new fields on index but i believe the order on their end can be set to what we provide. just wanted to add some information now.

comment: [~andreav]: This job cycles on the 1st of each month. Tomorrow is EOM. If client really needs to go live by 12/1, then we may need to hold their cycle until QA is completed. If it can wait until Dec 31/Jan 1 2022 cycle, then we need to make sure this project goes live by 12/13 before the mid-month code freeze.



For now, I will tentative update due date of 11/30 for today.



Thanks!

William, Do we need to do parallel too?


author: william.kong
comment: [~andreav]: I Just updated description of work in the ticket. Parallel is not required for this update.


author: andreav
comment: Fahad, once QA passes, DO NOT release the code until I have confirmed a release date with the client.

Hi [~andreav] 
I've attached the Transfer form also did the cvs checkin.. Please ask for help from Tun / Peter to release.
Thanks.


author: william.kong
comment: [~TunA]/[~andreav]: We are late with this code release. Can we get this released today.



[~andreav]: I'm not sure if we missed a cycle. I noticed in November we ran on 1, 2, 4. But in December we only ran cycle 1. I'm hoping job is on hold until code is released.




author: andreav
comment: No, this job is not on hold because client did not want to delay jobs due to the code releases. 


author: tuna
comment: Hi [~fahad],

Following code has been released.

Thanks
