comment: [~Natalie.Tom] per the description this project looks to be paper only, however for some reason there was ISD hours added. Can you confirm if you need us to do anything? If not, then I think the ISD story can be closed. Thanks

comment: [~dawnl]Please provide the updated SOW with the actual production filename as it still has not been provided

comment: Thanks [~Natalie.Tom]
[~dawnl], Natalie also confirmed that this is paper only. I believe we can close the ISD story since it doesn't seem like we need anything from ISD.
