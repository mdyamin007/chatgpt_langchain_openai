Would you please ask the client to provide us a sample data file and provide an account list to generate sample for them?



Thanks.

comment: Hi [~Juliana Vannik],



Any feedback from the client?



Thanks.

comment: [~rony] Please use this data file and include all accounts in this file for samples: 

loan_bills/sscu_loan_bills_09202022_1.psv.pgp (rec'd 9/21 in production).

Also, I will update due date to 9/26/22 instead.

Sample pdf:sscuml4120.pdf is in/d/ac-secure-share/imp/juliana/is-1594/ folder

Parallel id:20220916023821

Project:SSCUML41.zip is in qa folder.



In this project, we added several dates range where 'Days in Billing Cycle' is applicable. In the pdf sample, page 5, 1517, 2831, 2834, 6242, and 7164 contains the information where 'Billing Date: ' is between the date range.

comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid],



We added all date ranges from the description, but the data file contains only dates with "9/6/2022 - 10/5/2022" range. So can you test the other date ranges by modifying the data file?



Thanks.
