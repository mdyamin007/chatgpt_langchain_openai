title: MFCU - [28957][pvt] Additional Signers _ Duplicate
description: During out review of the member monthly statements, we found that the "Additional Signers" line will show the same name repeated 2 or 3 times.

We believe this is happening because the statement process must be looking for Joint members at both the+account+and+loan+levels.

While it is correct for the logic to show the member's name each time the account is flagged as a joint, we would prefer for each unique additional signer's name be printed only once.

Please see the attached document for 2 examples.



From Diego:

The specs the client gave are correct. We just need to check the additional signer names and compare the names to only show unique names.

Record 300 is where the signers are in which is very easy to see in either the mapping doc or in the dfa the developers worked on.

comment: [~anwarh], Please see below feedback from MFCU and advise.

Thanks

"I looked through all the samples, most of them look really good.

There was one sample, however, that for some reason is listing the member's name both at the address line at the top, and repeated in the additional signer's line below.



I reviewed the account, and cannot determine why the name was listed twice. Can you please review? I am available tomorrow afternoon if you want to have a short call. Please advise."

comment: Hi [~dyuen],

We are constructing the address form record line 200, and field 7-11.
 Data:
{code:java}
200~01~020032120327~03612-10-6200~04~0505012022~0605312022~07JOSEPH V GUIDO~08NAHED H MOHAMED~09532 JEFFERSON AVE~10CHULA VISTA CA 91910-5104~11~12CHULA VISTA~13CA~1491910-5104~15~16~17~18~1916~20~21~22~231~24jvguido81@gmail.com~251`
{code}
As you can see the name "NAHED H MOHAMED" comes from field 8.

But the additional signers come from record "300"
 Data:
{code:java}
500~0105012022~0250~032016 LANDROVER DISCOVERY SPORT~04~05Previous Balance~06798116~0772~0816~09~10~11~12~13~14~15~16~17~182~19~20~21Original Balance~221307127~23~241639`
300~01NAHED MOHAMED~021`
{code}
That's why it's showing up twice. Let me know if this clarifies the confusion.

Thanks

comment: Hi [~anwarh], I'm not sure I still understand... Is the Additional signers field pulling from two places in the data file? If so, why is that? Shouldn't it only pull from record 300?

Thanks


author: anwarh
comment: Yes, it's pulling only from 300.

If you look at the screenshot client provided, he mentioned why the name "NAHED MOHAMED" was "listed twice", one in address line and another in "Additional Signers" section.

My explanation was for this. Address comes from 200 and"Additional Signers" comes 300 record line.

comment: Hi [~anwarh], this is approved!

Per MFCU:

"These changes completed make sense. We approve these changes.

Please confirm if we will see them in place for June's month-end member statements?"

Can you confirm we can go live with these changes for this coming month end production? Per Jira description, parallel is not needed.
