Samples provided to client

Client responded to samples and has a question:

Hi Bill! These look great!

Just a quick question - I noticed I am missing 0002B, 0034B, and 0034C. Is this because they're the same template as 0002A and 0034A?

I just want to make sure before I give the official approval, the other ones looked perfect.


author: JIRAUSER11001
comment: Hi [~billr]

Actually they are not exactly the same template but they are similar. And the data file (provided by the client) had data for only one letter. So I just provided only samples of those letters.
 But if requires, I can provide samples with custom data.



thanks

Client responded below, do they need to send a data file or do we have one we can use?

Yes, could he provide those 3 samples as soon as possible, so I can approve before the go live of this Wednesday, June 29th

Client is asking for samples today:

Whatever we have to do to get these live tomorrow. Do you think there's anyway to get samples by 1PM Central Time? We'll get all the approvals over to you today. If we are not able to get samples today, we still want the go live day to be tomorrow. We are deploying our code tomorrow for the update.
