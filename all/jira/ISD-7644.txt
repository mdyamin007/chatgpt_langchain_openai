I separated electronic accounts and paper accounts and wrote those accounts in separate files. I considered statement type only as "default". I created two folders for those two files mentioned in the description. In each folder, there are two files. One file contains electronic accounts and another file contains paper accounts. I am attaching the zip file here.
