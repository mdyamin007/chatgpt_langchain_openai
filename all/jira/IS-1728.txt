Add Balance Transfer Promotion

Please use the data that is in the 582 fields as follows:
 APR is zero,
 Periodic interest rate is also zero, and that is in the data file and labeled 582-57 field
 Days in billing Cycle = 582-74
 Average Daily Balance=582-48
 Periodic Interest Charge = 0.00 (since APR is zero)

Is it possible to code the logic just for this statement run that if the 582-57 field is 0.00 then, to print out the APR, and Periodic Interest Charge as zero?
