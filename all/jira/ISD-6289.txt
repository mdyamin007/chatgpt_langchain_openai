Please review and advise if output looks ok or if there are any issues.

comment: [~lemoy28] I needed to add the new index file prefix dle, but I was able to repost on pilot/stage afterwards.

[~phoebe.george] I noticed there's some new letter codes 101, 108, and 110, which don't exist on our end so the site description is just showing as 'Document'. Do we have a list of all the enotice letter codes/descriptions we need to add?

comment: Hi [~Shun.Kuwashima] , thank you! Please reference this SOW link for the full list of notices, found on page 14 of the SOW:

[http://sharepoint-svr/AS/Shared%20Documents/SOW%20Directory/SSCU%20-%20Safe%20Credit%20Union/Fiserv%20DNA%20Core%20Conversion/SOW/SSCU_DailyNotice_FiservDNA_Core_PRINT_SOW.docx]

Note that SSCU only has 3 notices that are flagged as eNotice - all others are PAPER ONLY. Here are the eNotice names for the 3 notices:

101 = Paid NSF Notices & Report - Initial Notice

108 = Certificate Rollover Notification Letter

110 = ACH NSF Notice

Please let me know once updated and I'll check on pilot to confirm all looks good. Thanks!

comment: [~phoebe.george] I've added the notice descriptions for letters 101, 108, and 110 onto pilot, can you please confirm?


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] Pilot site is approved. I'm informing IS too, as they are preparing for final steps for QA.

Thanks!

comment: Perhaps I forgot to update this beforehand, but confirming that enotice letter codes 101,108,110 and resources are uploaded onto production, closing story.
