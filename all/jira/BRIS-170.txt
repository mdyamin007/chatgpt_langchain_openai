title: Brisbane ETABoard Configuration Fix
description: [~hesham.hanna]: Can you restore the brisbane IP address for the ETAboard. Last Thursday during the Brisbane power outage, you guys had me use this VM change IP address so that we can somehow log into the VMWare console.



Can you restore the IP and setting that we originally have in the Brisbane Server list:

comment: [~Terrence.Tong]: Per our seeking Wednesday Brisbane meeting. I believe you said you are able to connect. Just pending database sync. I will close this ticket out since Hesham restored the configurations.
