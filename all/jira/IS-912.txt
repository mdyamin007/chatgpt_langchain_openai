title: MFCU:  Daily Notice Bad Address list Processing Script In-house Fix
description: Parallel Required: No (But requires proof of regression testing to that DPVS counts matches Production).

Spec #1  Avoid using MC_BY_ACCT variable in Insert File rewrite
Remove Daily Notice processing script logic not update insert file MC_BY_ACCT variable.  The BadAddress mail code z will need to handle from the processing script/DFA level to flag mailcode=z.  

Recommend adding the following function call into your mfcudla_process.sh after the     format_all_ltr_set5 "s" call.
                      ${home_master}/master/mailcode_bin.pl $cid $prefix "${dir}${prefix}" $temp3 z d e


Spec #2  Update processing shell script to give DP the option to manually run job by job_sel f, s, e:
DP reported that they do not have the ability to run job_sel individually.  They need to have this flexibility to do so for ANY processing script as a SOP.  Please update processing script to provide this capability for the Daily Notice script.

comment: [~anwarh]: Please do not forget to work on this in-house project. We do need to give job_sel flexibility as a SOP for any processing jobs including this one (i.e. Spec #2 above).
