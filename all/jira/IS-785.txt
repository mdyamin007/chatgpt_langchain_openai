comment: [~Kbittmann] Customer wants the pdf file in the format "Acctnum_formName_Date.pdf"  (34567_1098_123121.pdf). There's one account number that has 2 entries and the first one gets overwritten. Can we add seq. number in the pdf file name to avoid this?

Thanks!

That should be fine. Out of curiosity, do you happen to have the account number on hand that I can review for myself?

Path to the pdf file:
/z/pdf_afp/lccu/lccutax/pdf/lccu_1099r_311_cd

Path to zip file:

Please see the below client feedback and advise.

I have reviewed the samples and tried to load some of them, but I discovered an issue with all of the index files.

*1099I* - the file names that is it expecting has a bunch of pipes after .pdf so it cant find the file

_Example_: (@E:\KEYSTONE_TAXFORMS\<Account number>_1099INT_123121_1.pdf|||||||||)

*1099Q*  the file names that is it expecting has a bunch of pipes after .pdf so it cant find the file

*1099R* - the file names that is it expecting has a bunch of pipes after .pdf so it cant find the file

*1098* - the file names that is it expecting has a bunch of pipes after .pdf so it cant find the file

*1098MTG* - the file names that is it expecting has a bunch of pipes after .pdf so it cant find the file

 _Example_: (@E:\MORTGAGE_TAXFORMS\<account number>_1098MTG_123121_1.pdf|||||||||)

No approval at this time.

Please see client feedback below.

We are noticing an issue with the *5498 file*. The system is adding "T#" to a payee Account number when it has more than one 5498 due to having traditional, roth, or simple IRA types.



We would like to request that as part of creating this index file you do the following:

1. Look for a capital T in the member number field, if you find it remove it and the number following it (whatever that might be)

This would result in us having the true member number in the field and the index file working properly.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.


author: JIRAUSER11100
comment: [~Kbittmann] Removed the T and the following number. Placed the sample in the client-pickup.
