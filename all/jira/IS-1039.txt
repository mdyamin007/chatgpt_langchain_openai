QA pass, ready for client approval.


author: dyuen
comment: Samples forwarded to client for review/approval.


author: JIRAUSER11101
comment: [~dyuen]any update on the sample approval?


author: billr
comment: [~zhuoxinT]

Customer responded to the samples:


After reviewing these samples, the business unit has some concerns about the font in the letters. In the example I am providing I have circled the concerns.
 * The Name/Address seems like the beginning is a little faded.
 * The letter "i" and letter "l" seem to be bolder than other letters.
 * We have seen this recently with another new letter and Daphne and I looked at it. I thought that maybe something is getting lost in translation when the sample is created and sent to us?
 * Daphne did pull a direct copy from printed sample last time and sent it to me. The font looked better in that copy however, I am now worried that, maybe, it is the font we are using on the new letters?

Thanks,

Tom

Since the original samples are oversized and not able to attach here, So I cut out some of the page, I think that causes the font issue.

I generated the new samples for approval in a proper way.

These look better than the previous samples.


Please check the AC Secure shared\IS1039

author: dyuen
comment: [~berezinez] [~zhuoxinT],to save the back and forth, I will request print samples when the latest samples Zhuoxin provided are approved. I'm trying to attach the samples that were approved to the Jira but no luck. I will check with David if he can attach them.


author: JIRAUSER11101
comment: [~berezinez]
exported to QA folder. Please check again,
These two letters are not included in eside, but they are included in PDF archival.


author: berezinez
comment: [~dyuen]

Is it not approved yet? Are we still waiting for samples approval?


author: dyuen
comment: [~berezinez], for clarification, we provided 2 samples back on 5/4, and those were approved. However, RWCU noticed that the agreement in the notices were out of date, so we had to do an additional assessment since the agreement update was out of scope hence the second round of samples.

The samples with the updated agreement was forwarded to RWCU for review/approval. Once those are approved, we move forward with print samples, etc.


author: dyuen
comment: [~zhuoxinT] [~berezinez], both sets of samples have been approved.

Zhuoxin, two questions:
 # Can we use the latest approved sample for print samples/parallel? Or should I submit 2 print sample requests?
[^rwcudl_sample_05312022_APPROVED.pdf]
 # Can you provide the print range and print file name for print samples?

Thanks




author: dyuen
comment: [~zhuoxinT] [~berezinez], any updates on this?

[~TunA] [~Igor.Khosid], [~William.Kong], FYI

comment: [~dyuen],
 Yes, you can use the latest approved sample for the print samples.[^rwcud127.print]
 filename: rwcudl1275.2oz.afp 
 print range: 1-10 22-30

FYI,I think Rony has another update for RWCU, the live data is earlier than this job.
 We will have to make sure the release date.

per TS#28031, I will also add the update here.
 Thanks


author: igor.khosid
comment: [~dyuen] please update the status of the story to "Pilot / Sample approved"
[~zhuoxinT] Please turn over to QA when completed for final testing


author: dyuen
comment: [~zhuoxinT], is the job Rony is working on for IS-1171?

As for TS#28031, does that mean this Jira is not only for the letter/disclosure update but also the archival update?

Lastly, print samples have been requested.

Thanks


author: JIRAUSER11101
comment: [~dyuen]

yes, IS-1171.
I will release #28031 update and letter/disclosure update together.


author: JIRAUSER11101
comment: [~dyuen],
update on TS#28031, Rony updated the script and he will release that with his update IS-1171.

I will sync with his code later.


author: dyuen
comment: [~zhuoxinT], sounds good. The live date for this Jira is after his, so that should be fine. For now, we can review the print samples then initiate parallel when ready.

Thanks

comment: Just noting, [~berezinez]will complete final QA when she is back in the office per my discussion with [~Igor.Khosid].

[~zhuoxinT], I noticed that [~rony]updated ticket #28031 stating that he updated code, but per your comment on this JIRA, you mentioned that would be taken care of when parallel for this is done. Can you update the ticket?

Thanks

Sorry, maybe I made you confused. Rony is taking cate of the update for #28031. He will release that with his job IS-1171.

author: william.kong
comment: [~dyuen]: Can you setup a short meeting with [~TunA]and [~zhuoxinT]to clarify your comment above. We are not really clear on this. Thanks!


author: dyuen
comment: [~zhuoxinT], please see feedback from RWCU about the archival sample files:

"Can you have your team check these zip files? I am getting data errors from both when I attempt to un-zip the files.
 Most of the second is erroring out completely"

Thanks


author: JIRAUSER11101
comment: [~dyuen] 
Sorry, These are the split zip files based on size. We have to provide all the zip files to client.
I copied all the files to client_pickup/test/RWCU_NOTICES_DLA_Archival_*06162022*_1.zip.??? (001-021)
Client has to put all the files in the same folder to extract pdfs.



Thanks


author: dyuen
comment: [~zhuoxinT], There are 2 issues with the archive sample files. Please see the following:

We are getting an error on import.

I think it may be related to an extra space in the XML:

!image-2022-06-16-16-17-38-681.png!



Second Issue:

The Cabinet line is empty.

Needs to be <Cabinet>NOTICES</Cabinet>



Can you correct and provide a new sample set?

Thanks!


author: william.kong
comment: Per [~zhuoxinT], new samples provided on Friday.


author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~zhuoxinT], please see following feedback from RWCU:

The<Index Name="DOC DATE"/> line is empty.
 We will need to correct this and try again.
 
Please confirm once a new sample is ready.

Thanks


author: JIRAUSER11101
comment: [~dyuen],

Can you send me the SOW? what values should we use for DOC DATE?

It's a little difficult to read, but it's under Sect 1.1 Special Requests. This an example that was done for one of the Business Lending Billing Statements.
