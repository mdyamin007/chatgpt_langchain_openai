comment: [~dawnl] The functionality to change accounts from E to paper on an unenrolled user profile is now on pilot. Here's a few accounts they can check on InfoTRAC pilot, they should each have only one unenrolled user tied to them:

comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid], the ability to change accounts from electronic to paper on an unenrolled user profile on InfoTRAC account management tab is now on stage, please have someone verify. *Note*, it is expected that these accounts cannot switch back to electronic because there is no enrolled user. Here are a few accounts who should be able to switch to paper, and the user profile should also show Enrollment Status as 'Not Enrolled':

[~dawnl] Can we also update the due date? If the client is flexible, I think we can roll this out to production by 4/20. Otherwise if they have a preference, let me know and we can work around that.

comment: *QA - Completed.*
Checked in InfoTRAC (Pilot/Staging env) for unenrolled users can be switched from E to paper (this function is available if you set the parameter 'disableForUnknownSSODSO' to FALSE in InfoConfig).

comment: [~dawnl] Since QA is done, I can actually release this to production as early as today EOD since we don't need parallel for this. If not today, early next week works too. Let me know when I can release to production.
