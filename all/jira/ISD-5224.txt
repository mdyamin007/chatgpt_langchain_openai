We are on track. QA on DSi side is currently testing this feature.

I will let you know once it's on the pilot. hopefully, it will be on the pilot by the end of tomorrow.

EWBB DSO pagination has been deployed to the pilot and it's ready for the Client's test.

Let me know if there's any issue.

+Points to be Noted:+
 # Pagination logic is the same as SSO, If the user has more than 100 accounts user will be able to see pagination.
 # There's Javascript changes so clearing browser cache before testing is recommended
 # Previously even after dso enrollment user has to go through another round of enrollment, it wasn't the expected behaviour(wasn't reported by the client either). So I have also fixed that issue along with pagination.



Thanks,

Abdullah

Can you please provide me some test DSO users EWBB can use to validate this update? 

Thanks, Barnett

I will have to create those. I will create and provide you the details.



Thanks,

comment: Hi [~barnetts],

you can use the following users to verify DSO enrollment pagination on pilot.
 # *Organization ID:*ewbb
 # *Username:*
 ## testuser    1000 accounts
 ## testuser2   494 accounts
 ## testuser3   174 accounts
 # *Password: '*Testing123!*'* (same for all the users)



Let me know if you are facing any difficulties.

Can you please advise on EWBB question listed below?

EWBB tested with the DSO users and of course user with the most account take longer to load the account list page. If they are validating will all users will see paginations on step 3 of the enrollment page? 

Below is the result on how long it takes for user to see the step 3 account list - 
testuser1 - 1 min 30 sec
testuser2 - 40 seconds
testuser3 - 20 seconds

Will this change apply to SSO users too?

Thanks, Barnett

I wanted to follow up with you.

comment: Hey [~barnetts],

That's so weird, I commented my feedback as soon as I saw the comment on the same day. I don't know where it went. Sorry for this inconvenience.

answers are the following
 # All the users will who are linked with more than 100 accounts will see this new pagination implementation on enrollment step 3. users with less than 100 accounts will see what it was previously.
 # The loading time is expected, it is faster than the previous implementation.
 # DSO was developed following the same logic as SSO, I have developed this for SSO about two years ago. There is no change for SSO users this was already there for SSO.

Thanks,

Abdullah

comment: [~abdullah.baki]- I am following up for Barnett since he is OOTO this week; here is the client's response:

"I have no further comments for DSO updates at this time. Please let me know when we can release this update to production."

Thank you,

If this is approved by the client on the pilot, I can move it up to the stage and After QA is done it can be released.

I believe it can be released on 10/21/21. Let me know if there's any expected live date from the client.



Thanks,

Abdullah

comment: Hi Abdullah,

This is URL i am using for DSO page:

[https://ewbbstage.infoimageinc.com:9680/login.jsp]

Please provide URL in case above URL is not correct.

I don't have my account for login to DSO page and DSO page does not have link for new users to create account like all other DSO have. Please provide login credentials:

Organization ID; User ID; Password to login to sso page.

If it is different behavior during enrollment for users with less then 100 accounts and more then 100 accounts, please provide data for it too.

Thank you,

Natasha

comment: Thank you Abdullah for providing information for testing.

Verified enrollment process on staging DSO site, it works correctly.

Just as a note, for 2 first credentials i have eStatement page empty, I assume it is just testing accounts, For the third credentials I see all accounts with statements on eStatement home page
