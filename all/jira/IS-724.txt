*Per client's comment #53 on TS#23875 1/12/2022:*

*What is the split count or size for each batch?*

500mb is fine.

*What will be the index filename?*

Happy to hear your suggestion. I'm just making this up on the fly but I'd assuming, something like... statementType-index-date

*What is the archival email recipient's address?*

itadmin@ppcu.org and possibly accounting@ppcu.org. The itadmin email I'm thinking should be the main email, so we can monitor any issues with the import.

This project is holding for a while.

I will remove from developer resource list, if we don't have any action within one week from now.

Developer will not reinitiate project until we setup new timeline.

Please let me or Peter know if we need to restart the project.

Thanks,

Tun

comment: Hi [~dawnl],

Just FYI. I removed from resource schedule. We can just leave as "hold" for this Story.

But we will need new timeline when client wants to resume this project. 
 Because the developer may busy with other projects.

Please let [~Peter.Dang] or me know when client wants to resume project.

Thanks

comment: Hi[~TunA],[~Peter.Dang],

Client approved the sample. See client's comment below.

"Hello and sorry for the ultra-long delay. So I recently received approval from the archival team that the PDFs and Index files will work. What do you need from me to start producing the previous X-# months statement PDF files?"

Please note that the service cancellation for Pacific Postal CU (PPCU) will be effective August 1, 2022.

Please note that PPCU will terminateInfoImage Services effective August 1, 2022. The termination takes place AFTER the July Month end statement cycle, InfoImage will be processing this month end file.

Thanks.

comment: [~dawnl]: If we are going to resume this Tax project and client is leaving August, then what is the client's intention. Do they want us to process last year's Tax PDF archival.



Regardless, all the programming is done; Whether or not we release this project willl still need to be billed out. Please let us know the plan on this project. If we release, what do we do next after code release. If there is NO processing needed, then we should not spend the effort to release this project.

comment: [~William.Kong]- I have reached out to client regardinglast year's Tax PDF archival.

comment: [~William.Kong], [~TunA],

Yes, client wants us to process last year's Tax PDF archival.


author: tuna
comment: Hi [~dawnl]

I copied new set of tax archival samples\ac-secure-share\ac\dawn\IS-724\ from Eric's latest codes. I cannot tell those are correct archival format. Because the project is HOLD for long time.

PPCU_1098_311_2021_1.zip

PPCU_1099I_311_2021_1.zip



Please request DP to copy to client_pickup folder and request client to approve again. If client can approve as is, I will release rest of the codes to production. If client do not approve, let me know the reason of not approve. We will need to re-assess this project.



Thanks,

Tun
