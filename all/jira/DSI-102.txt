title: BANB - Email Not Updating when on Paper
description: Currently, if the accounts are set to Paper, whenever the user SSO in, the email in the NP record is not updated/created. BANB is an affected client. Expected behavior should be, we always update email in NP record (or create one if does not exist) regardless of whether the account is Paper or Paperless.
