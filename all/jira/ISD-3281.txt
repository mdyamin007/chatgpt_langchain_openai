title: INHS - Document Processing - AFP to PDF Pre-Conversion
description: None


author: tai.trinh
comment: According to Sean, [~rifat.mahmud] and your team have worked on enhancing the Document Processing to properly pre-convert AFP files to PDF if they are larger than a certain page count. Just like how to the AFP Processing is doing (afp.convert, afp.convert.cutoff, etc.).



Please let me know the status on this, and let's finish it as we do need this feature to be functioning. Last thing Sean said he was aware of was that it was ready and committed to Dev? I do not have the bandwidth to carry out testing, so if that is the case, please do the necessary testing.

Otherwise, if there's still development to be done, please prioritize finishing that.

comment: Conversion should take from a global doc.convert=true in processing.conf (we want conversion to always happen). doc.cutoff in global file should be 150. Other configurations should be the same as afp.

As it is done from our end, you can mark this as done if you have finished reviewing it.

Thanks
