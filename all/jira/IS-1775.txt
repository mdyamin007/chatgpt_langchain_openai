comment: Hi [~Ricky Lopez],

Why is this ticket? We already have an implementation ticket open at IS-1474. 
Also, [~Tasneem] also provided a sample with this key where you also confirmed they were able to import our archival sample.
https://jira.infoimageinc.com/browse/IS-1474?focusedCommentId=56316&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-56316

Can you please clarify? 

Thanks
