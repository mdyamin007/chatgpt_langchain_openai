title: BKGC - [21536][pvt] New eNotice- UPDORM_E.STM
description: Letter code: 010
Description: Inactivity Notice

Added to doc_desc on dev/pilot, also updated the dev/pilot/stage code to pull desc from doc_desc. Emails changes tested and works on pilot and stage as well.

Doc_desc changes:
Processing-ui code: BkgcEmailHandler
ROOT and MSM: enotice/list_inc.jspf
ROOT: enotice/popReminder.jspf
MSM: statements/selectStmt.jspf
MSM: proofing/admin.jsp

Internal:
Committed email handler changes to prod, will let DSI handle the deployment. Should not affect production anyway since they don't use the notice_list keyword in their email templates.

Doc_desc changes have been released to production.
