title: Need to specify index file naming convention
description: We have no requirements in SOW (3.0.13) for index file naming:
|*File*|*Name/Description*|
|Individual PDF|<member#>_<mail date>_ARM_<seq#>.pdf

*Notes:* * Seq# is any sequence, i.e., 1, 2,3,100, 200, 300

_(Ex: 123456_04242014_EA_1.pdf)_|
|Zip File|DLH_<mmddyyyy>_<seq#>_IDCU_7z.gpg

*Notes:* * <Date> is same as notice zip file date above in section 2.3
 * Seq# is any sequence, i.e., 1, 2,3,100, 200, 300

_(Ex: DLH_04242014>_1_IDCU_7z.gpg_|
|Index file|{color:#de350b}*Note:* append all account entries into the existing DLH Index file.{color}|

As it is implemented now, index file name uses 3 sequence numbers and 2 dates in different formats. I suggest we use the same naming as for Zip file.

DLH_${procdate}_${g_segment}_IDCU.txt
eg: DLH_06212022_1_IDCU.txt

Is this what you mean?
