comment: Hi Bryan,

I see two IS Stories and two ISD Stories.

Actually, we need*Four IS stories* and *One ISD stories*.

Could you please modify and let me know? Then, I can assign four IS stories.

Thanks,

Tun

comment: Hi Tun,

I have now added IS-359 and IS-360. I also have marked ISD-5211 as done since we only need one ISD story. Thanks.
