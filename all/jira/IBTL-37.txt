comment: Hey Will,

I changed Assignee to your name.

Where should I type'@'followed by my name? You mean, in this comment box?

Also, when you said "Can you retry one more time", you want me to try run edcu again in rh2 (10.4.20.34)? Or try to update this ticket for assignee?

Sorry for so many question.



Thanks,

Tun

I reprocessed edcumv1 in rh2(10.4.20.34). Papyrus formatting is ok this time. But it is failed in next stepget_infotrac.pl. I think this is database connection issue?

Thanks,

Tun

comment: [~TunA]:  Thanks!  Database is not ready yet, and will be next week.  For now, i will assign it back to me.  When Database is up and running next week, i will re-assign for you to re-test.



author: william.kong
comment: [~TunA]Per my email today, since the database is up. Can we resume testing to get through the database connection step?: 


author: tuna
comment: [~William.Kong]

Assigned back to Will. Because database is not ready yet.


author: william.kong
comment: [~TunA]: Can you retest now that the stage databases is up. Thanks!

Hi Will,

Network email server setup not the only issue for this test.

The process gets error before get into email alert triggered.

/z/edcu/edcumv1112.c1bmcok is empty file (see image#1 below). The first error is "ERROR: Line counts for .txt and .c1bmcok mismatch" within code1 function inisisdisk_daily.sh (see image #2 below).

I am not sure which step in code1 function was failed and .c1bmcok file cannot populate.

We might need Ernest help for that.

Please advise.

Thanks

Tun

comment: When you see errors regarding ace, if it is not something obvious, you should always look at ${d_dir}/zip/${prefix}.paplog to see if anything is reported there. In this case, one of the databases has expired. I am syncing them now. Will let you know when it is ready

Thank you Ernest!

Sorry, you told me that before. I keep on forgetting to check that .paplog file.

comment: Hi Ernest,

I got different error in /z/zip/edcumv1112.paplog.



Verification Error

comment: Will, the ncoa process cannot access/home/test for a file on BB rhs2. Would you check the mounting?


author: william.kong
comment: [~ernestw]: Can you try one more time? The system has been rebooted so that I can get a clean re-mount process


author: ernestw

comment: [~TunA]: Interesting... Didn't realize our dpvs_rpt program uses PC's DataTRAC system as well. Datatrac Database is schedule to be completed as early as today. I will keep this ticket assigned to me to address the DataTRAC database issue.



Thanks!


author: william.kong
comment: [~TunA]: I'm going to close this issue out. The datatrac database issue is resolved. As of yesterday, i've enabled the /d/ncoa_dirs syncing between Menlo and Brisbane so we should not have future NCOA processing issues.
