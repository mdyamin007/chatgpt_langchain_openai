title: UFCU - Update to Archival for All Apps - RUSH on Mo Stmts
description: From Client:
We will add a Salesforce ID field to the daily XREF file that is sent to InfoImage
For the index files sent back to United, we would like the Salesforce ID added as well as the email address (already included in the XREF file)
This would be for all applications, so anything not currently using the XREF file would need to pull information from it for the Salesforce ID and possibly email address
