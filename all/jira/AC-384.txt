title: SNFB - [24915][pvt] STMT DDA & SAV_OVERLAPPING PRINT_ADDRESS PRINTING ON IMB
description: I took a look at this. In this case, address line number 2 has a string length that is going to next line because it is exceeding the text box length.



After adjusting the length it was able to fit. They are already correctly capturing 40 characters per line. I have attached the section of data for this account. The data 'SEPT 19 2012' is part of the address fields. Seems like a simple text filed width adjustment can fix this.



Below is the address capturing logic, its capturing by fields as indicated in the mapping. If "RM 169" is to be next to street then it may be best to have client fix that and also have client omit any dates in the address lines.
