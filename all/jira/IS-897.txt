title: DACB - [26907][pvt][in-house] Account Analysis Incorrect Date
description: development hour: 2
sample date: 03/07/2022
approval date: 03/10/2022
qa date: 03/11/2022
live date: 03/15/2022

The Account Analysis statements are still using the year of 2021 when it should be 2022. I can confirm they are all are wrong on analysis statements from 1/31/22. I have an example in the attachment for your review. Please notify when the change is made going forward and if there a way to prevent this from happening next year? Thanks!



-----------------per Yamee--------------------------------

For account analysis statement date, program has the end date as end month, end day, and begin year. Will need to make update to use end year for this date.



Dawn please create a programming request for DSI. Per Peter, it would need to go through QA and sample approval process.

Sorry, possibly I uploaded the wrong sample. Would you provide this sample/d/infoftps3/Vend_DSI/client_pickup/print_process/dacb/ts-25100/dacbms15178.pdf to client? Please ask Peter or Yamee to pick this up for you if you don't have access.

The samplewas for 2/17/22 but the issue was on 1/31/22. See client's comment #30 in TS#26907.

Please provide sample for 1/31/22.

Thanks.

Sample is/d/infoftps3/Vend_DSI/client_pickup/print_process/dacb/is-897/dacb_dda_013122_5.pdf generated from 013122 cycles.

Page 8324 is the example that client provided in comment 3 in [https://app.na3.teamsupport.com/?TicketNumber=26907]which shows 2022 now.



Thanks
