comment: [~Peter.Dang]: Please advise if project is still on 'hold'. Also, is program updated and tested in parallel to ensure it prints ok in Texas. Now that we are moving away from this vendor to print the job, I want to make sure we've done our full parallel to make sure DP & OPS tested the processing and print output.



Please advise.

comment: [~Peter.Dang]: Are we on schedule to release this project today? Did parallel pass? I believe the vendor is no longer going to print NSF notices starting tomorrow.



Please advise.

comment: [~Peter.Dang]: Per your spark response, the code has been released. You've been super tied up on support and have not been able to close this ticket out. You will close this ticket out once you have a chance.



[~dyuen]& [~cesparza]: We should be set tomorrow to start print HTBK NSF notices since our print vendor discontinued services. 

Thanks!

comment: [~William.Kong]per masterparallel 21023, Peter rolled code back earlier today. I also closed out the Epic. Not sure if I can close out IS/ISD stories.

Thanks


author: william.kong
comment: [~dyuen]: IS and ISD is responsible to close out our stories to my understanding. Peter is super tied up today when I followed up with him. He will close this story once he frees up. Thanks for responding!
