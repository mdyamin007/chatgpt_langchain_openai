title: 37684  - FNBK eStatement Nicknames
description: Please research ways we can make the account names shorter. 

My immediate thoughts are:
1. Don't show Checking/Savings/Credit Card
2. Do we have Account masking? Show only the last 4 digits.

So the list would be
0123 - Health Savings Checking Account
2341 - TOMORROW'S MARKET
5222 - MONEY MARKET

Etc. This is research only. Nothing needs to be developed yet.

If possible, please have it done by tomorrow 9 am PST.
