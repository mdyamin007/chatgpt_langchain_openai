author: JIRAUSER11003
comment: Hi [~phoebe.george]I ran into an issue during processing that is preventing me from generating the eStmt index file. I will get theindex file to you as soon as possible.


author: JIRAUSER11003
comment: Hi [~phoebe.george],

I attached the index file.

Filename: [^dma_20210513_1_20211217_0904_ewbb.txt]



I had to change 2 of the names for the input file. This change was needed because the script was picking up the the foreign letters as regular letters due to the letters containing the same substring.

Changes:

1)welcome_letter_no_ach_foreign.pdf changed towelcome_letter_foreign_no_ach.pdf

2) welcome_letter_ach_foreign.pdfchanged towelcome_letter_foreign_ach.pdf

comment: [~jasonV] In addition to copying the location of the index files (when ready), please also update the date format:

dma index file has wrong date format MMddyyyy. It should be yyyyMMdd.

comment: [~phoebe.george]: The ticket live date is set for 12/31. What should be the correct revised live date for this project so that we can plan the release after ISD addresses their issues. Please allow us 5 days to prep.


author: william.kong
comment: [~phoebe.george]: This ticket date is still past due. We cannot have a floating date as this month is very tied up. We need at least two weeks advance notice.

comment: [~jasonV] I know that we're in QA right now, but I just got off a call with EWBB. They attached 3 zipped file to ticket #22628 to comment #106.

Is it possible to have these processed in TEST and generate index file for me to have ISD post to pilot site? They are hoping this can be done today as we continue with our QA. This is used for either training and/or demo purposes on our end with the new applications. Thank you!

I tested with provided in a story index file 'dma_05132021_1_20211227_1153_ewbb.txt' , it was already processed on pilot, but there are no notices or statements available for accounts from that job {jobID #186395)


author: JIRAUSER11003
comment: [~phoebe.george]I will test the 3 data files

[~nprimak]I will look into the issue for nonotices or statements available for accounts from that job {jobID #186395)

comment: [~phoebe.george]I tried processing the files and the program is unable to decrypt the pgp encryption. Can you please send the files without pgp encryption?

Can't process index file, have error processing, ref #187187


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: Hi [~jasonV], the index file cannot post because it cannot find this folder ewbbdma-02142022/ewbbdma_14_1_20220314_1517_0.zip inside the path /d/INPUT-DEV/indiv_afp/ewbb/afp-archive. Can you advise?


author: JIRAUSER11003
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima]I will get this resolved


author: JIRAUSER11003
comment: Hi [~Shun.Kuwashima],

I talked with Nischala about the issue. The zip files are in/z/isd_input_dev/indiv_afp/ewbb/enotices/02142022-1/

Did you try to post this as a statement or enotice? It needs to ne entices


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~jasonV] [~phoebe.george] EWBB doesn't have enotices on production. From my understanding although it's technically a letter, it should still be posting under the mortgage tab on the e-site and therefore should be considered a mortgage statement instead of enotice. Can you confirm?

author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~jasonV] Still failed. The afp folder location ewbbdma-02142022 exists, however it's empty so it cannot find ewbbdma_14_1_20220317_1223_0.zip


author: JIRAUSER11003
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima]Thanks for trying to post I will continue to try to resolve the issue.


author: JIRAUSER11003

author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~jasonV] The afp zip folder name needs to be named ewbbdma_14_1_20220317_1520_0.zip. Once I updated the zip folder name, it posted successfully. Can you look into why the zip foldername was not named correctly and potentially have another file generated to ensure we don't encounter this as we move along?


author: JIRAUSER11003
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima]please try to post the most recent index file [^dma_02142022_1_03212022_1502_ewbb.txt]




author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~jasonV] There's an issue with that index file. In regards to the zip filename, for some reason it's showing up in two columns rather than one so that is resulting in more posting errors. Can you please look into this? Here's an example from the file:

Notice|PDF|001|ewbbdma_0009214456_20220214_e_00001.afp|*ewbbdma_14_1_03212022_1502_0.zip|ewbbdma_14_1_20220321_1502_0.zip*|02142022|02142022|1|0009214456|05||SHENGJIADAI ZHOU|||||||

comment: [~jasonV] [~Shun.Kuwashima] [~Igor.Khosid] [~phoebe.george] 

Any updates? Shun I am waiting for you to verify index file


author: nprimak
comment: [~jasonV] [~Shun.Kuwashima] [~Igor.Khosid] [~phoebe.george]

Still issue with the index file, IS will look into it


author: JIRAUSER11003
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima]please try posting this index file [^dma_02142022_1_03232022_1541_ewbb.txt]

the zip file is no longer appearing twice


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~jasonV] although the duplicate zip filename is gone, that extra column is still there due to the additional pipe delimiter. Below is an example line, notice that there are two pipes between the zip filename and the Begin Date. We just need one pipe there, and instead we need to have a pipe added to the end so that we still maintain 20 fields:

Notice|PDF|001|ewbbdma_0009214456_20220214_e_00001.afp|ewbbdma_14_1_03232022_1541_0.zip||02142022|02142022|1|0009214456|05||SHENGJIADAI ZHOU|||||||

I did some testing to verify and it should work if the format is as follows:
Notice|PDF|001|ewbbdma_0009214456_20220214_e_00001.afp|ewbbdma_14_1_03232022_1541_0.zip|02142022|02142022|1|0009214456|05||SHENGJIADAI ZHOU||||||||

Please try fixing the format again.




author: JIRAUSER11003
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima]please try to post this index file the pipe delimiters have been moved to the correct position. [^dma_02142022_1_03242022_1337_ewbb.txt]




author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~jasonV] The file was able to post successfully on pilot, however there is actually an issue with the begin/closing date fields which is causing the stmts to not show. It should actually be in yyyymmdd format instead of mmddyyyy, I did validate but I provided you an incorrect example previously so that's my bad. Can you provide an updated file once more?


author: JIRAUSER11003
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima]can you please clarify what value needs to be reversed to yyyymmdd? Is it the name of the index file?


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~jasonV], the date fields inside the index file should be yyyymmdd, otherwise the process spits out a completely different date than expected. See example below:

Notice|PDF|001|ewbbdma_0009214456_20220214_e_00001.afp|ewbbdma_14_1_03232022_1541_0.zip|*20220214*|*20220214*|1|0009214456|05||SHENGJIADAI ZHOU||||||||
