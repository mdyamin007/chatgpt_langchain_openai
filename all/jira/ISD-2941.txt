Coding is done. Currently, admin users having *sess_permissions >= 7* are allowed to Reassignment Statements feature. Is it okay? Let me know which admin user should be allowed to this feature.

Thanks.

There is a mismatch in functionality with the sender/current acct input and the recipient/destination acct input. The sender acct input doesn't require leading zeros but the destination acct input requires leading zeros.

Please update the destination acct input field to also accept account numbers with and without the leading zeros.

Example Acct Num is:0000067165, both input fields *should be able to accept 67165 or0000067165.*

Thanks,
Patric

comment: [~mamunur.rashid] I was testing msm on pilot and noticed the 'Reset' button doesn't work.

The functionality of the 'Reset' button is to unselect the selected statements and it works both on pilot and dev. Are you referring to some other functionality?

I just tested the reset button it is working, thank you. I was testing on stage and it did not properly send the statement from one acct to another. Can you please login into MSM on stage and let me know.

The issue that you mentioned is happening in stage because there is noAUDIT_LOG_CTCU table in stage database. Please create that table and test it again. Let me know if it works or not.

Thanks.
