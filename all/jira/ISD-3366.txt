title: Hypercube - Display Nicknames without Reading from SSO Request
description: Currently, how nicknames work:
 * Account Description is being passed via SSO, and we use that value to update the usr_acct_type_mapping table via API.
 * Then, the userAccountsAPI will return the account description which Hypercube will read to display the Nicknames.

We need a new flag:
 * This should not be used in conjunction with the Account Description from SSO.
 * We will have a new ProcessingJob (not part of this ticket) that will insert into the usr_acct_type_mapping. This will allow the userAccountsAPI to return the nickname in the Account Description field.
 * When this flag is enabled, then the nickname will be populated with the values returned from the API.
 * This nickname should be displayed also during Enrollment and on the Profile page (Maybe the current Nickname already work that way?)

I have added three screenshots where the nickname shows in the hypercube. Do you need a flag that will show or hide this nickname from these three places? As there was already a flag in the hypercube "showAcctDescription" which shows or hide the nickname from the profile and dropdown list. I have added that flag in the enrollment step. Is this what you want?

Okay, I see. Yes, let's also add it to the Enrollment steps.

Just to clarify, if we use this flag showAcctDescription, and not use captureAcctDesc from SSO, then we will load whatever account description we have from the usr_acct_type_mapping table. And then if we do not a nickname value, we will use the account general description that we define in the properties, e.g. if DD account, display Deposite, etc.

Thanks,

Yes if we do not usecaptureAcctDesc and setshowAcctDescription as true then it will show thewhatever account description we have from the usr_acct_type_mapping table. But if there is no row inserted in theusr_acct_type_mapping table then the API will not send any nickname and in that case hypercube shows only acct number, no acct desc.

Thank you for doing the research. We do not need to do any development for this then. You can close out the ticket.

Thanks,
