Currently the client is receiving the paperless report on a daily baiscs. Do they want to chang it to monthly?

I've attached a copy of the daily report for review. It includes all the accounts that was changed in delivery pereference in one day.

Here is client's feedback:

"I have the file. Changes will need to be made; however, my team is scheduled to meet this week regarding this issue. I hope to provide feedback on what is needed as soon as possible."

Could we update the existing EMAIL file that Maps provides InfoIMAGE, adding the Delivery Preference to this monthly file?

See client's feedback below.

"It was determined that the monthly report that was requested of InfoIMAGE in this case on 5/23/2022 is NO LONGER needed.

It was determined that Maps needs to provide InfoIMAGE a monthly file with all our Delivery Preference for each account. InfoIMAGE would need to match to this file monthly. Maps does not want InfoIMAGE to send 7changed accounts from the MONTHLY report to be sent back to Maps the next day.

Could we update the existing EMAIL file that Maps provides InfoIMAGE, adding the Delivery Preference to this monthly file?"

Sorry about the delay update.

The monthly processed "ECL"(email) file doesn't have the ability to update delivery preference. But we do have a standard process call "paplerless file" which could be used to update the customer's delivery preference.

Client wants to proceed with thatstandard process. Please provide the standard file format & the naming requirement.
