Hi [~dyuen] 

attached are samples.


author: dyuen
comment: [~rony], looks like they have an issue with the font now... Please see the following:

"There is an inconsistency with the font in the letters.

The font for the address should match the font for the contents in the body of the letter.

Can you have the programmers update the font of the address?"



I don't believe the font was changed... either way can this be done? Or would it pose an issue of now showing in the window of the envelope?

Thanks


author: dyuen
comment: [~rony], any updates?

[~TunA]fyi.


author: rony
comment: Address is arial 8 body font is arial 10 . Previously I kept body font arial 12 but when I checked existing letters say letter 110 it was arial 10 so I chagned the body font to Arial 10. Below are the updated samples.

[^sfcedl112-3.pdf]


author: dyuen
comment: Updated samples forwarded to SFCE for review. I have a feeling they may push back on the font of the letter body being size 10, but I will wait for their response.



[~Bryanl], FYI


author: dyuen
comment: [~rony], SFCE has one more round of revisions:

comment: Hi Ronny,

Customer responded to sample:

The credit union has another change to the Courtesy Paid Letter

Please use this verbiage for all versions of the courtesy Paid Letter for the first paragraph verbiage

On*VARIABLE1*, you initiated a*VARIABLE2*transaction, details provided below, when there were not sufficient funds in your*VARIABLE3*Account. Per your Courtesy Pay agreement with the Credit Union, this transaction was paid, and an insufficient funds fee of*VARIABLE4*was charged to your account.
