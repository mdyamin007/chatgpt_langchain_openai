This is for statement.

We changed one thing, we moved the message before disclosure. Meaning disclosure will be on the last page for estatement. Would it be ok? This actually reduces coding complexity for us.



Thanks,

Rony

comment: Hi Rony,

The change is live from 03/31 - 04/01. so the message will need to be backdated after it is ran on 04/02. The backtracking is usually done the following week.

Thanks. Barnett

comment: Hi [~rony]/ [~TunA],

Can you please backdate the message and please assign back to me when this is done?

Thanks, Barnett 


author: rony
comment: Hi [~barnetts]

No need to backdate actually, the message will not be displayed going forward. We put a condition in our code so that it only shows a message if the cycle date is 03312022. If not it will never display the message.
