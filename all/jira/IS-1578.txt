comment: Eric Yan - Please let Enrico and I know when this is ready for UAT testing. I do not see the job posted on InfoTRAC job status yet.

comment: [~Tevis Mak],

The index file is not associated with a valid dt_job_id. Could you request one from PC and reprocess to generate a new file?


author: JIRAUSER11401
comment: [~eric.yan]

Here is the new index file with the updated dt_job_Id,  [^ar1_20220908_1_20220928_0822_gmbk.txt]

comment: Hi Tevis, here is the updated logo from Wilson. Please update before you rerun the job. [^SNFB Guard Mort Logo BW 09-22.tif] 


author: andreav
comment: @Tevis, sorry hold off on the logo change. I think it should be greyscale. The one that Wilson provided also still looks grainy. Are you able to just crop off the tagline on the bottom of the logo that you are using?


author: rodriguez
comment: [~Tevis Mak]Please see attached psegs below, tagline has been removed. Modify dfa to use these psegs. After modifying dfa with new psegs, please forward the estatement pseg to [~eric.yan]so he can upload. Then please change the mail_full_serv flag to ASE3 in your control file & re-run on pilot & staging using DT JOB IDs below. FYI [~andreav]
