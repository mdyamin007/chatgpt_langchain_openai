title: Job Status Archival Period
description: Analysis Request: Update InfoTRAC's Job Status history to be configurable per CID. As of now, we only display jobs for 120 days. Need to confirm feasibility and effort.

*Concern and Consideration:*

Will this affect loading time on job status page?

Do we have enough storage in MongoDB?

Print team will need to support this by not purging the archived document for Print job. Does Print team had sufficient storage to extend archive period?

Archival Period cannot be greater than eStatement's archival period.

Thanks

comment: To get the data in job status module, infotrac uses isd, pc, is and i3jobtrack database. and also uses infosync API. As currently we are supporting 120 days for every client which is hard coded into infotrac side. If we want to set the value client wise, we have to create an API which we set the value in mongo for each client and also have to make sure that each DB will support athreshold if there is any purging script. This is ahigh level overview. We will dig into this soon.
