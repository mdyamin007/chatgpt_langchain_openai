title: ca-isis-pr-##:  Re-Testing Rebooting
description: Since the Redhat Processing servers migrated from the Menlo VM Server into Brisbane VxRail Server, the rebooting has not been successful.

The issue is most likely due to NFS. There are some servers in the /etc/fstab that gets stuck.

This is due to servers that are+not+ active or have not been setup in the Brisbane VxRail Server yet.



Action Item is to review the /etc/fstab (NFS) and also /etc/rc.local (CIFS) to ensure all the entries point to active servers and the nfs/cifs port are opened.

comment: As of today, I worked with Hesham to test rebooting rhs & rh2 & rhs2; Indeed it was the nfs/cifs configuration pointing to a non-existing server that caused the issue.



It's all fixed today.
