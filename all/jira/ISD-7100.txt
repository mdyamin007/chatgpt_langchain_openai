Notes for assigned developer (Please add to JIRA Story and Epic):

- Use and modify the INI and EE used for PLBKDN404 (plbkdn404.ee & plbkdn404.ini). This is ran on the Iswk3 server 124.

- Use prefix plbkdn408 for INI and EE and also to update letter code table in plbkdna_redtitan.control. The verbiage "Loan Rate Change Notice" can be used for description.

- Use file pattern provided by customer to update pdf pattern table and letter code table in plbkdna_redtitan.control.

- This app uses 2 DFA's for all 7 letters. PLBKDNP11.dfa is used for the simplex letters and PLBKDNP21.dfa is used for duplex letters. Please use PLBKDNP11.dfa since this will be a simplex letter.

The index file is posted, but there's no letter 408 in this index.

408|Loan Rate Change Notices is added to all env db.

comment: [~eric.yan] - When I checked it had only letter 408. What letter do you see?

I was looking at the wrong file. I think QA has posted the correct one already.

comment: QA is completed.
