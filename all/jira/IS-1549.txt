Please see client feedback below:

In reviewing the sample, we noticed that the superscript for item 2 in the footer is missing in the body of the notice. This should be placed after the overdraft fee dollar amount.

And can we also add "Rev. MM/2022" (filling in the month with the month this update goes live) under the equal housing logo? This can be in a gray text.

"Rev. MM/2022" is addedunder the equal housing logo. For now, we used '09' for 'MM' here.

The position of the superscript for item 2 is fixed.

The small gray text font size is changed to 5 and the position is fixed now.

This is slightly changed and more accurate with the client's requirement. Client should review this.

The masking part was existing code. Here if the data file contains 4 or fewer digits account number then it shows the last 1 digit and if the data file contains more than 4 digits account number then it shows the last 4 digits.
