title: GCBK - [28747][pvt][in-house] Escrow Analysis Closed Accounts INHS
description: From what I can gather, this would entail:
-Creating a new statement type/email template for Closed Accounts prefix ea2
-Updating the Number of Statements report on the admin site
-Migrating all the existing ea2 statements to the new statement type
-Disable AOLP for the ea2 prefix tied to the new statement type
-Adding new statement type to Infoconfig for API
-Adding new statement type to the optoutFeature in the conf file (Needed for email sending for now, not sure if we have an internal project yet to fix this).

Fyi, they have custom logic to allow escrow statements to show under the loan tab instead of its own, so we would need to add the new statement type under loan as well. I'd give this maybe 8 hours for all the updates and testing, please adjust if you think otherwise and also provide timeline.

Internal notes:
-For SSO users, closed escrow will be viewed under the Statements tab.
-For admin users, closed escrow will be viewed under the Loan tab.
-Inserts will need to be created under the Loan app type in order to show next to closed escrow statements.
