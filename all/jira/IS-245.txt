comment: Hi Keri: As you mentioned yesterday, this story is related "IS-232ALCU - Change EForm Back to CU Address".

But I am not sure, what exactly needs to update. I will assign to Jun. Please discuss with Jun. We might need a meeting between you, Jun and me.



Hi Jun: Please check what we need to update. Please request Keri to setup a meeting if necessary.

Thanks,

comment: Hi [~kericapote]



little confused about what to do here. The description says,

*_Change address on statement to logo, phone number, and website only._*

so we need to add the below logo in the first page of statement for paper?



!image-2021-08-04-22-27-02-058.png|width=535,height=324!





The description also says:_*All applications to use a custom #10 envelope with InfoImage's Return Mail PO Box on it.*_



So the envelope itself will contain the return address? In this case , we don't need to anything for it.



And,

_*5285 - permit*_

_*5286 - non-permit*_

So those are the new stock codes for envelopes? As per current settings I am seeing:

{color:#de350b}_*4401,4401,4402,4406*_ - those will be no longer applicable?{color}



Maybe the task is easy but it's new for me, hence that many questions?



Thanks,

Rony

comment: [~rony] This one needs the return address to be just the phone and web address (and change outer envelope). I attached the approved eform.

All other applications we are changing just the outer envelope.


author: kericapote
comment: [~rony] Envelopes will be 5285, 5285, 5286, 4406. SOW is correct.


author: rony
comment: So the current _*PO Box..*_in the return addressneeds to be removed, right?


author: rony
comment: per @keri , envelope will be53606, 5306, 5307, and 4406

Keri, please confirm that this change only required ENV stock code to be updated. The returned address update is not required.


author: kericapote
comment: [~Peter.Dang] the change to the eform to use the one with no return address is men tioned in the description above. The approved eform is also attached.

Parallel id:20210816121748

I just added Env info to control file. That's all the change. So no print sample or index file or project to provide.



Thanks,

Rony

comment: [~rony] ALCU is saying that the above logo with no address was not changed for the 8/31 statements. Please look and let me know if you changed it,


author: william.kong
comment: [~kericapote]: I don't believe what client is reporting is related to this project.



The requirement is to update job to use the custom single window envelop that has the preprinted new Return Address in the envelope. Return mail is when the Post Office is not able to deliver the piece of mail and returns the mail back to the return address labeled in the envelope. It has nothing to do with the content of the statement since we are using a "single" window envelope.




author: kericapote
comment: [~William.Kong] per the insrtructions on this job it says Change address on statement to logo, phone number, and website only. The customer approved eform is attached. We need to fix it.


author: william.kong
comment: [~kericapote]: Can you ask Wilson to create the artwork for the return address. We may not have the matching font. Also eStatement as well. eStatement uses color.



Also, I think ALCU is using e-forms, so we will need a new PDF pre-print as well. It llooks like Page 1 of the statement uses e-forms.



[~rony]: Please wait for Wilson to create the updated logo resource and advise Ruman/Shadiq to use it.

Also, we need to work together to setup eForm. I'm going to enlist Nischala to help on the eForm portion of this project.




author: kericapote
comment: [~William.Kong] Wilson already created the eform and the customer has approved it. It has been attached to this ticket since the beginning.

[~rony] please use the customer approved eform attached above for paper, e, and archive if applicable. Igor is waiting to QA.


author: william.kong
comment: [~kericapote]: Where is the e-form? I don't see it in this attachment. Will need Nischala to help on this task.



Color eStatement logo resource will be needed as well as black and white logo resources for the subsequent pages.


author: william.kong
comment: [~kericapote]: Sorry, I can't seem to read. I see the e-form attachment. But we do need the logo resources. for print and eStatements.






author: kericapote
comment: [~William.Kong] my understanding is we just use the eform for paper, e, and archive.


author: william.kong
comment: [~kericapote]: For this application, e-Form is used for only the first page. All subsequent pages is black & white. Think of e-Form as preprint. We have job that only use pre-print in one tray and the rest with Reg White paper on the other tray. 


author: kericapote
comment: [~rony] [~William.Kong] [~Igor.Khosid] Color and b/w logos attached for eStatement and archival.

comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid]



Sorry to bother you. I misunderstood the requirement from the beginning. Besides the envelope change in the control file for env ( which you already tested and in production ), we needed to order print sample and post isd index as the preprint and subsequent logo got changed.

Could you please request another print sample set? For some reason, (please see attached print samples "IS-245_ALCU_Print samples 09282021") logo is incorrect and shows "PO Box ..."

However:
 # Attached resource file S1ALCULE.300 - looks correct
 # Papyrus output - looks correct
 # eSite after processing index file - looks correct

comment: [~rony] please provide new dpvs for print samples.

Thanks!


author: william.kong
comment: [~Peter.Dang]: Per our discussion this morning. Please help research what eForm is currently in Prisma. We are speculating the eForm that Keri attached may need to be updated. The stock code is the same as what we used last month. If so, Wilson needs to redo the eForm.

Secondly, per SOP, the SOW is not updated with the correct stock code. This is causing further confusion as to what our team needs to plug into the control file:
