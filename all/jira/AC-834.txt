title: CAMB - [31448][pvt][in-house] DP -- CAMB PDF 8/8/22 Redtitan errors
description: This issue appears to be related to our internal tools where the version of software used to parse the pdf (RedTitan) results in a memory issue when parsing this specific pdf data file. I will need to make an update to use a more recent RedTitan version. Please have a Jira ticket created and assigned to me for this hotfix.
