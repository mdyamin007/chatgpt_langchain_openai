comment: Hi [~gthillaivel], may be this datafile contained CML and CNS, and in our monthly project we are not supposed to print data for this major codes, and that's why its giving warning message.

[~mahbubS]please confirm if you want to handle in this way

comment: Hi [~gthillaivel],

We already talked about this in QA turnover meeting that i will update the warning message and not abort the program.

Earlier it was decided to abort the program if a loan appears in data.

Thanks
