Client is unable to provide a test file because there are not currently loans for all of the ranges, they just want to have the range set up for future products.

comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid],

PDF sample:[^APCUMS21.pdf]

Due to the unavailability of the test file, we processed the data file "/z/download/apcu/APCUMS21.DAT" for creating the sample. In this data file, we modified some of the loan types which would be in the new range(for example 1042,1099).

Also, there is no parallel ID yet because another developer is working on the same DFA/project. I generated the pdf sample locally.

ProjectAPCUMS21.zip is in the QA folder. If you want to test this by changing the data file please go ahead.

I was told no ISD update was needed.  The change is to add ranges for business loans only.
