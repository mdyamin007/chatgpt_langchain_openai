And attached is a preliminary sample. But the notice name is wrong for which I need the sow.

!image-2022-02-07-15-10-05-069.png!

And as I mentioned in [https://app.na3.teamsupport.com/?TicketNumber=25861]I used info code 024.





Thanks

Any feedback about sow?

I am following up with the client on the naming you mentioned in team support ticket 25861. Once confirmed I will update the SOW.


author: JIRAUSER10911
comment: [~rony]

The client says this name is not correct. It should say privacy policy. Please edit name accordingly.

Updated sample is/d/infoftps3/Vend_DSI/client_pickup/print_process/WECU/wecudl024.pdf. If you don't have access please ask Peter or Yamee to help retrive it.

And let me know after you update the sow.

Please see the below from the client.

TD_NOTE belongs to letter #18 in our list of daily notices. The Word template attached to my first post does not have this name anywhere.

Could you please assist with providing the samples?

Please see the below client request.
Can we make one last change (sorry)? We decided we would like to remove the Account Number section (label and value) on the notice. Since the account number is included in the data file, we still want it to be able to post electronically for members that have selected that as a preference...we just don't need it on the notice itself. Thank you!!

Can you replace the date in the first sentence of the notice template? Instead of March 1, 2022, please put *April 28, 2022*. Thank you!

Please see client feedback below.

I'm sorry, it looks like we overlooked another date. On the second page of the notice template (see below), can you please replace March 1, 2022, with *April 28, 2022*? Thank you.

Any update on the newest sample request?

comment: Oh, [~Kbittmann]it looks like we are using image for this part. Can we have tiff image from your art person say Wilson with updated date.


author: william.kong
comment: [~Kbittmann]: Can you please advise when client us targeting to go live with this project. This project is past due and Feb 24, 2022. Can we established a target live date of this project to be by 3/15/2022?



Updated Artwork due by 3/4;

Updated Samples by 3/7

Approvals by 3/9

QA 3/9

Parallel: 3/9

Live 3/15


author: JIRAUSER10911
comment: [~William.Kong]



Can we go live 3/11 instead?


author: william.kong
comment: [~Kbittmann], can client provide approvals by 3/8? Also need to ask [~Igor.Khosid] (QA) to finish 3/9 and (Print + eStatement) Parallel to finish in one day by 3/10?  If you can help ensure the client and all department finishes on time (i.e. follow-up closely), then maybe yes. But if there is no oversight to expedite, I have a feeling it won't make it by 3/11.



 Will

[~Kbittmann]live date 3/11 will be too tight. I haven't even provided enotice and archival yet.

comment: Hi [~Kbittmann]

would you please provide me the sow link?


author: rony
comment: Hi [~Kbittmann]

without latest sow I cannot make progress on scripting side and hence I cannot provide parallel form.


author: william.kong
comment: [~Kbittmann]: Please respond to [~rony]'s response above; Again the timeline will be missed again. I'm marking live date to be 3/15 since both [~rony]& [~Igor.Khosid]tentatively as agreed above, however, if we do not get the SOW information updated so that Rony can complete the scripting, the timeline will need to pushed out furthermore.


author: igor.khosid
comment: [~Kbittmann] [~William.Kong] [~rony]

I do not think the due date is feasible. The timeline needs to be updated


author: JIRAUSER10911
comment: [~rony]
