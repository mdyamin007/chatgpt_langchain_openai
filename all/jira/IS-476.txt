comment: Dates have been updated.

[~eric.yan] ISD provided a copy of the paperless file in the meantime:

sucu_etax_paperless.MM-DD-YYYY.txt

Is the xref file available? I should be able to provide the index file once the xref file is ready.

I couldn't find the paperless file either, do you know where ISD placed it?

comment: etax index has been provided to ISD for testing yesterday.

comment: pending client feedback on etax sample on pilot.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~eric.yan]Thanks, sorry for my late response, the pilot is under review by the client at this time, will confirm once approved, targeted by EOW. Thanks!


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~eric.yan] Sorry, I did not catch this, but SUCU reported that the right edge is slightly cut off on the posted PDF - is this from the IS side or ISD side? Pls reference attached.

comment: Hi [~phoebe.george]

I checked other tax forms, the layout is the same. If you read through the text, all wording are complete and nothing is being cut-off.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~eric.yan] thanks for checking on this to be sure, from her screenshot, it looks to be cutoff, but i can see everything. 

Separately, can you confirm if the full 1098 file was posted? I know there were exceptions due to the dates of the xref file and using last year's tax data. Can you check member #106459, name is BOOKER C BENSE? SUCU is saying that this member should have 2 1098 tax docs posted from last year's file, and just wanted to confirm if you can see it in the data. Thanks!


author: eric.yan
comment: [~phoebe.george]

The 2020 1098 data has two records for "BOOKER C BENSE" under two account number.

1120003472
 1120003818

Only "1120003818" has a match in the xref file to member number "106459" and it's posted. The other one has no match and wasn't posted.

I've also attached a list of non-matched account numbers. All these records are not posted because there's no matched member number in xref file.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~eric.yan] Thank you! I have informed the customer and will confirm once the pilot is approved, it should be approved by this afternoon. Thanks!


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~eric.yan] [~mac] SUCU has approved the eTaxes on the pilot site. Please proceed with next steps in preparation. Thank you!
