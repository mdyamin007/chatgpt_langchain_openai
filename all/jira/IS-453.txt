comment: [~andyp] thanks for the additional samples; STAR has APPROVED. Please move forward with next steps. Please also confirm if you saw the updates tied to the "Auto triggering" for automated processing (separate from the CRON update). it's on the main Epic description... this should be part of the update, but let me know if you need to review and/or discuss with me or Peter. Thanks!

For file scan auto trigger, please create a separate ticket and especially one ticket for ISD to add notification through inforeach API.

In the sample I see the cheques , but when I load the PDF ,images are not displayed due to tiff missing.Attached is the screenshot !tiff_missing.PNG|thumbnail!

You need to change project file STARMS11.prj to have the TIFDIR pointing to your mapped drive to /d/iss/prep/star/tiff folder to be able to see the tiff images.

Modified this line:

$TIFFDIR="U:\prep\star\tiff"
