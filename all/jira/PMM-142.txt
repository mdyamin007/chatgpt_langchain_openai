title: Team Support Ticket #12473 - RWCU
description: HI Daphne,

I have been asked to look into the possibility of making a change to size and/or color of the PDF Icon that is in use on our website where members access their statement. Apparently, we have some members complain that it does not stand out enough and they get confused about where and/or what to click on to retrieve their statement.

Would we be able to request and enlargement of the icon and/or a color change? Would this be a work order for customization of the SSO web interface?

I have added a screen shot for clarification.

comment: Hi Daphne, this is something coming from our members. They are having a difficult time accessing their statements because they don't know what to click on. After clicking on everything or calling our call center, they finally get thedocument open.

If you can't change the PDF icon, can you update the page. Maybe just adding the word "View" above the word "PDF" on the icon so the icon reads View PDF.

Thanks,

Johnny

We discussed some possible changes that we could make so that the CUs members weren't facing this issue. We are thinking of modifying the image that is there to have pdf in the title something similar to this !https://app.na3.teamsupport.com/dc/1888578/images/a0465ee6-fb9f-4016-b094-fd06dec368b2.png!  so that the member knows that it is a pdf. We need to find one that we are allowed to use before moving forward. We also are going to have the hover over state something along the lines of to view pdf statement click type. This is on our slate to work on but as of now there is no timeline until David is able to discuss with his team.
