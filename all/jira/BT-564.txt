title: Error in checking the required checkbox.
description: Based on the Client's answer per comment 18, ticket #34533: "There is no change to the penalty boxes. Which box is checked depends on the term of the certificate. We send this information to you in the file with the tag frequency to indicate which box to check. If frequency=1 then it indicates to mark the 90, if frequency=2 then it indicates to mark the 180."
