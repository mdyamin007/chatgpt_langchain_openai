 are.



-------------------per Peter----------------------------------------

Please confirm below for this request.

Update program to convert RT1 and RTM to PDF and place to client pickup folder.

* need filename convention. Below is SOW for DDA. If need to change DDA to EA would work.


 # *Special Handling Files:*All accounts with the Statement Handling field set to RETURNED MAIL - HOLD in Record ID 100000 position 99-118 need to be routed to the EQBK_DDA_HoldMail_<MMDDYYYY>.pdf file which will be dropped into the client_pickup folder after each cycle. PDF will be password protected using EQBKs FTP password.


 # *Invalid Address Handling:*Invalid addresses that are not covered by RETURNED MAIL - HOLD need to be routed to the EQBK_DDA_InvalidAddresses_<MMDDYYYY>.pdf file which will be dropped into the client_pickup folder after each cycle. This will take lower precedence than the Special Handling instructions. PDF will be password protected using EQBKs FTP password.
