title: Test External Client FTP Servers
description: e.g.:

osi ftp server

frst server

web-vault



Peter to add a list of server/scripts to test into this ticket.



Attached list contain number of scripts that using SFTP. We will need to test connection for each of this site.

[^sftp_list.xlsx]

comment: [~Peter.Dang]: Just a reminder, we need to have this task completed by EOD 10/6/2020 so that we know which scripts are using external URLs and which ones don't work.


author: william.kong
comment: [~Peter.Dang]: I just glanced through the report. Can you add another column to tell me which protocol it is using?



e.g.:

ftp

ftps (ftp over ssl)

sftp (ssh ftp)

https

etc..



For example, cambdla_sftp.pl is using sftp (ssh ftp) and it did not allow connection



I need to run a quick connection testing to see if we can login or not.






author: william.kong
comment: [~Peter.Dang]: Per our conversation, all of these are sftp (ssh ftp) protocol.


author: william.kong
comment: [~Peter.Dang]: Per our conversation, please have your team test the connection to see if it can connect and all the ssh key is accepted upon first time connecting.


author: william.kong
comment: [~Peter.Dang]: Per our meeting today, please try to have the team complete this task by EOD Thursday.

comment: Will,



Yamee and I tried to test sftp from BB servers, but all were not able to connect.


author: peter.dang
comment: Try to test sftp but all test failed at connection stage.

comment: [~Peter.Dang] and [~yameelee]:  Can you review attachment [^sftp_list.xlsx]

Would like to have the CID document? I highlighted yellow cells that either I don't know the CID and need to confirm if client is no longer with us? If so, please strikethrough and delete the code.



[~kent.chan]: You can see a preview of the results? As promised, this is the list of clients we need to inform that we need access. There is just a few rows in the excel spreadsheet that i do not know the CID and if they are still active.

comment: update to sftp_lsit.xlsx with cid/app/server process colums.


author: william.kong
comment: [~kent.chan]: Please ignore HICU. They are no longer client of ours when review the attached list. Per our meeting this morning, this report should conclude the list of clients we identified for sftp connections.



[~Peter.Dang]: Thanks for the update!


author: william.kong
comment: [~William.Kong]: Per Kent's request, i need to simplify this spreadsheet to CIDs and server name


author: william.kong
comment: [~kent.chan]: Here is the spreadsheet summary. Please note in column 1 "InfoIMAGE Vendor". For those, we need to contact our vendor instead of client.

comment: I've created tickets for:

FRST- ticket 14644

SANA- ticket 14666

EWBB-14665



did not open tickets for the other clients since they are all using transfer.walzgroup.com, so as long as the FRST ticket is complete, it will work for SHEL

comment: [~Peter.Dang]- can you test EWBB, they have whitelisted the BB IP

I found the issue. We needed to allow this outbound

I tested all the FTP servers listed. I am able to connect to the following:

walz, newcourse, ewbb

I am not able to connect to opensolutionsasp, vaultguard and smft

The Opensolutions ftp server has an issue where the old verison of the sftp module does not have the newer ciphers. How do you do it now?


author: william.kong
comment: [~Peter.Dang]: Per our meeting today, Kent enabled ca-preproc-pr-02 for opensolutionsasp

Can you please double-check:

walz, newcourse, ewbb







The other two still does *NOT* work webvault.vaultguard.com and smft.firstrepublic.com; Kent is assuming it may be related to their server having IP filtering in place.



[~kent.chan] is going to reach out these two vendors to ask them to add our outgoing IP address.
