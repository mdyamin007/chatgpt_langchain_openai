comment: Hi Azhar,



This is the contextual search project that I mentioned. Because of amount of work needed for this project, we want to start earlier. Please begin by analyzing the work needed for the customer site.



To support this feature, the statements needed to be post using document processing. EWBB is currently using afp processing and it supports the cripple flag logic. This feature is needed to be exported to document processing. I will create another ticket for this so that another developer can work on it.
