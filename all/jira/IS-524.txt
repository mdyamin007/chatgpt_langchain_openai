title: KYCU Deposit Statement Redesign
description: Create new formatting program for DDA Statement, update Message Manager with template and artwork, eStatement update, 
 and PDF archival programming updates.




 * Eliminate eForms:
 ** Per Tina on 12/1/2021 9:56am. Ok to eliminate.
 ** Document in Transfer Form for Tun/YaMee/Peter to remove eForm rule during parallel & production code release.
 * KYCU Redesign (Print).pdf <-- Still TBD if logo in upper left corner is color; Everything else will be gray scale.
 * KYCU Redesign (E).pdf <-- Full color:
 ** Note: Current program uses full TIFF image as a background. It needs to broken down to piece (i.e. Logo, watermark)
 * PDF archival is color



{color:#de350b}*** Additional Logic Requirement: 12/23/2021 ***{color}

We are migrating our old PDF archival system to the current PDF archival system that many of our current and new clients are using for PDF archival. We would like client to test the output of the PDF archival. The specifications will be the same and just wanted to make sure they review it.

comment: [~tanmay]: I'm going to pre-assign this project so that it is in your radar. Per [~phoebe.george], this is+not+ a redesign but rather a cosmetic update. I will ask Phoebe to see if we can re-title this ticket to be cosmetic updates.



We will also update the description of work as well too to reflect the changes.

5. stock code if it is going to change


author: william.kong
comment: [~phoebe.george]& [~kericapote]: Please advise status on the deliverable above. If we are indeed going to use color logos for Print, then we need Wilson to send us the color logo resource specs (i.e. the ColorWorkFlow pdf process).

I just looked at the attachments again and noticed color watermarks. Will the print need the color water marks as well? If so, we need that as a separate resource from Wilson and do color matching for print.

comment: [~tanmay] I reached out to Nar and AS and no one says they are working on KYCY monthly statements.

Customer feedback:

Please remove the word 'Statement' under the Statement of Account box so that the two headers are 'Start Date' and 'End Date' only.



Please provide dpvs for print samples.



Thanks!

[~tanmay]: This morning we discussed to have you merge your code with Nar's to so that can also test the conversion from pdfi to afp2web. I will add this to the description of work so that Keri & Client will know to test this feature.

comment: [~tanmay]and [~William.Kong]:

I have exported my project to/t/mahbuburT/kycu/

Also, in that folder you will find the processing script and control file need in the revision for e option instead of pdfi.

[~kericapote] 
 I am merging Nar updates into redesign updates.

1. Here for archival Nar used different color other than blue whereas we have used blue(0,105,172) in redesign project. Previously i guess there is no color for archival. let me know which color we should use? If we stick with Nar updates we need change the color for all bars.

!image-2021-12-28-17-35-17-923.png!

2. Moreover Nar added following backer for archival. Previously there was none

comment: [~jira_naru]I have merged the codes and placed at parallel. will you please check everything is okay at your part.


author: jira_naru
comment: [~tanmay]:

I checked the archival generated in the parallel, and it looks good to me.


author: kericapote
comment: [~tanmay] will you post the archival so customer can approve?

Feedback from the customer is

The information is not centered between the + and -. Other than that, they look good. Thank you.

comment: [~jira_naru] 
 I ran archival,got the following error
 !image-2022-01-04-20-25-11-947.png!

when we use 7z and zip based on volume it adds sequence number at the end of the zip filewhile breaking down files to around specific size(for this app you has used 20GB). like
 KYCU_STMT_Archival_11302021_<segment>.zip.001
 KYCU_STMT_Archival_11302021_<segment>.zip.002
 KYCU_STMT_Archival_11302021_<segment>.zip.003
 ... so on

Here error comes fromverify_archival.sh
 !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail!

this script only looks for "**.zip"* and *"*.7z*" extension. so it can not findKYCU_STMT_Archival_11302021_<segment>.zip.<sequence> . In this you need to use external logic to verify the archival.
 !image-2022-01-04-20-37-57-508.png!
 the following code will not work as well there could be multiple zip file and zip file name gets changed adding sequence number.

!image-2022-01-04-20-43-11-183.png!

please check the code and rerun the archival process.

As per our agreement I'll start testing next week
1. Please be sure SOW is updated
2. Please attach updated mapping
3. Please attach approved samples
4. Who is BA on this project

[~tanmay]
Please provide mapping you used

I do not see any mapping in the SharePoint ... ? Please provide


author: kericapote
comment: [~Igor.Khosid] there is no mapping as this was just a cosmetic change. No BA either. Attaching approved print samples. I also sent the print samples that you have to the client to approve the blue color so those are approved as well.

I have used the doc as the reference. You can use it for testing. And the datafile is also attached here which is dummy. It may help you.

comment: Hi [~tanmay],

Per Ernest's email (*Sent:* Tuesday, January 25, 2022 5:03 PM).I have removed the kycums1 entry in the *test* rule table so that Prisma does not use the kycums1 ticket that pulls the eform. When the job is ready for production, please remember to make the same change to the *prod* rule table.

A day or two before releasing code, please work with whoever release codes for you. We need to figure out which e-forms and rules need to add to production.

Thanks,

Tun

A few issues identified:
1. Missing backer on the print
2. On eSite - incorrect highlighted header >> orange instead of blue >> See attached  >>>  [^IS-524_KYCU_esite issue collor.pdf] 


author: tanmay
comment: [~kericapote] [~Igor.Khosid] [~Shun.Kuwashima]

1. stock code3694 has been used. please check if backer is set up or not. backer is coming from external. And what is the meaning of "the backer from3213".
2. eSite sample is good at out end . [~Shun.Kuwashima]will you please check.


author: kericapote
comment: [~tanmay] the backer should not have changed. Per the SOW it uses the backer from 3213 (attached above). Let me know if you can use that or keep the one the program was pulling before. Please correct asap. Thx!


author: tanmay
comment: [~kericapote] [~Igor.Khosid]

we have added backer in print sample

1. Backer is - added
2. Papyrus output displayed unexpected segment from the other client and overlapping with the "important messages" section >>>  [^IS-524_KYCU_unexpected segment.pdf] 
3. On eSite - still incorrect highlighted header >> *orange instead of blue*


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~tanmay] I checked the output on both pilot/stage admin site and SSO, and I see the orange header showing in both the initial index file ms1_11302021_2_01062022_0437_kycu.txt and the most recent ms1_11302021_2_01282022_0608_kycu.txt, it also shows as orange when downloading the statement. Is there a resource we need to upload?
