comment: [~Kbittmann]: Live date is on Monday. Since this project is not approved yet, we will not make it for 2/7/2022 live date since it requires parallel. Please advise status on when client can approve project. From there, we will make a decision on the next available time slot for QA & Le & OPS.

The client has approved the samples. However, they want to hold off releasing this update until March. They will keep us posted on a live date.


author: william.kong
comment: [~lemoy28]: Per your suggestion, please move forward with QA while we confirm when in March we go live.

comment: [~William.Kong]

No live date. I have requested this info again from BANB.


author: william.kong
comment: [~Kbittmann]: Looks like parallel passed, but we do not have a determined live date. I'm going to change the status to be "On Hold" b/c we do not know when in March to go live. Please give us at least 3 business days in advance to make sure [~lemoy28]is available for code release on a revised live date.


author: billr
comment: Customer responded to what day do they want to go live:

Our go-live date got pushed back. it's tentatively set for May 11, 2022. I'll provide an update once I know for sure that we are going live that date.


author: william.kong
comment: [~lemoy28]: Per [~billr], live date is pushed to May 11, 2022.



[~billr]/[~Kbittmann] : Since client approved this back in Feb 9, 2022 there will not be any more programming updates other than code release. Thanks!


author: william.kong
comment: [~billr]: Can you confirm if we are going to release by 5/11? If so, I will revert this status from on hold to In Progress. Please advise.

comment: [~lemoy28]: Let's discuss in today's scrum meeting. For now, I will change status from "On Hold" to "In Progress"; I will need you to confirm if there has been any changes to the original programming with your project and see if we need to redo RUSH QA.

author: JIRAUSER10911
comment: [~William.Kong]



They have provided a tentative date of June 23, 2022.




author: william.kong
comment: [~Kbittmann]: We need to initiate another parallel test because the were other project related to this application that was released prior to this project going live. So we have to redo parallel all over again.

Please create another set of parallel forms for this letter.

Thanks.

author: JIRAUSER10911
comment: [~William.Kong]

Live date has been pushed out again. They do not have a firm live date at this time.

comment: Hi [~Kbittmann],

I will move due date to 07/20. If we cannot go live until that time, we will put on hold for this project.

comment: Hi [~Kbittmann],

I removed from resource schedule.

We can just leave as "hold" for this Story. But we will need new timeline when client wants to resume this project.
Because the developer may busy with other projects.

Thanks,

Tun
