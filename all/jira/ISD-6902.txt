comment: [~Tin.Chak]and [~davidt]- I have attached the TFSL-Pre-Enrollment test file


author: 5b1ee5a72eea651bacdeca2e
comment: [~mamunur.rashid] For the pre-enrollment file, can you do a mapping for the account type? Do you have other questions about the that file?


author: mamunur.rashid
comment: [~Tin.Chak],

I have added the mapping for the account types. I have also processed the file that [~Ricky Lopez] provided using StandardEnrollmentHandler and StandardEnrollmentRegistrar.

I have deployed the conf file on PUI-Pilot.

Also, I have created tfslPreEnrollment.bat file to process the file. Cause from PUI frontend if we want to process enrollment file then the file name must be started with the prefix (ms1, ms6 .. etc). But TFSL's file name starts with tfsl.

Thanks.

comment: [~Tin.Chak] [~mamunur.rashid] NCR reported the following error when testing SSO connection:
 # This info is from the engineer for infoimage: As of right now, we are completing a successful initial exchange request, where we get a key back and then attempt to redirect with that key. However, when we redirect we end up on a page that says "Error Undefined". I can provide you with the key requests via secure messaging.

I'll attach the NCR logs once received.

I have checked the pilot server's logs and haven't found any error log there.

Did they use the password as below?

author: phoebe.george
comment: [~mamunur.rashid] I confirmed that NCR is using the correct password.

They provided these attached logs - is there anything else that may be causing the error Undefined issue on when they try to connect that you can see based on these logs?

Thanks,

comment: [~phoebe.george],

The meta files are okay. As we are not creating accounts from the doc process for TFSL we need pre-enrollment file for the associated account given in these files.

Also, please let me know about the account types mapping. Are they gonna pass account types same as NCR in pre-enrollment files?

If so, then I have to do some coding in doc1 process.

Also let me know the statement type of file-name prefix me1 and ml1, like ms1 means default statement type.

Thanks.

comment: NCR confirmed

appl code 45 is being mapped as DITYP 32


author: mamunur.rashid
comment: [~Ricky Lopez],

Here is the sample externall enrollment file:

[^tfsl_06032022_0900_extenrollment.txt]

There was confusion about the account types. So in this report, the account types are not the same as TFSL provided. After we finalize the account type I will provide the actual report file.



So appl code 45 is mapped as DITYP 32. What about other types? Let me know.

Thanks.

comment: [~mamunur.rashid] We don't need to worry about the prefix and the meta file that Phoebe attached. We are not using it for posting. It's be used by a new process that will send email notifications, and that will be worked on by Anil.

comment: [~mamunur.rashid]Who is taking care of pre enrollment. I see just 60 accounts posted on dev and they have account type values of letters not numbers. When I am trying to estmt index file for statements, loan and visa they are failing because of missing account numbers in database.

comment: [~mamunur.rashid] TFSL confirmed that the date format update looks good on their end, thank you!

Separately, they tried to the SSO again and still getting an error. They are pulling logs from the NCR side, but are you able to check on our end to confirm if there is anything we can check to help trouble-shoot? Thanks!


author: mamunur.rashid
comment: [~phoebe.george],

I have checked the log on our end. I haven't got any error log so far.

Let me know the time when they tried to do the SSO.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~mamunur.rashid] Thanks, I have requested the time stamp and a screenshot from their last login. TFSL will be trying as well - the last login attempt was done by NCR.

Separately, the bank has decided to eliminated the disclosure PDF's (that you noted on our internal call for the 'Understanding your..." disclosures. I will update the SOW accordingly; the bank will still just keep the hyperlinks.

I've requested the Meta font file as well.




author: phoebe.george
comment: [~mamunur.rashid] One other question on the external enrollment file - will the production files include the header record? They can accommodate either way (with our without), but just wanted to confirm so they can program accordingly.


author: 5b1ee5a72eea651bacdeca2e
comment: [~mamunur.rashid] Looks like the SSO issue is due to missing static files. It might be due to a new proxy server being used on pilot.


author: 5b1ee5a72eea651bacdeca2e
comment: [~mamunur.rashid] The new pilot proxy servers are here:

10.5.8.81 ca-extproxy-pi-11.infoimageinc.com
10.5.8.82 ca-extproxy-pi-12.infoimageinc.com

Network said they will add the internal DNS, but in case it's not there, you will need to add the IP above in the host file. I don't know your Linux user name, Rifat can help create the login for you. I created it for him.

[~rifat.mahmud] Please help create a login for Mamunur for the two servers noted above. Thanks.

author: mamunur.rashid
comment: [~nprimak],

It is because the new proxy server is not synced with static CSS files.

[~Tin.Chak],

I tried to modify the post-build script in Jenkins to sync static files with extproxy-11 and extproxy-12 but I got the following error: "/var/data/jenkins/keys/ca-extproxy-pi-11/.ssh/id_rsa not accessible: No such file or directory."

Could you please generate rsa key pair and buildhypercube-docker_ca-hypercube-pi-01 andhypercube-docker_ca-hypercube-pi-02?


author: mamunur.rashid
comment: [~nprimak], [~Tin.Chak],

I tested the pilot site by adding the following line in the host file:

10.5.8.209 tfslpilot.infoimageinc.com

That's why it got the static files from extproxy-pi-07 and extproxy-pi-08. Jenkins post build script synced public file with extproxy-pi-07 and extproxy-pi-08. I didn't know about the new extproxy. So jenkins build script was not updated.

We have created rsa key pair on ca-utils-pr-01 for extproxy-11 and extproxy-12 but couldn't do ssh-copy-id. While we tried to do ssh-copy-id from ca-utils-pr-01 to ca-extproxy-pi-11.infoimageinc.com we got host name or service unknown error, which is due to internal DNS is not setup yet. But we also tried ssh-copy-id using the ip of ca-extproxy-pi-11. It didn't work.

[~Tin.Chak]Do you know what might went wrong?


author: 5b1ee5a72eea651bacdeca2e
comment: [~nprimak] Can you test now? It should look good now.

[~mamunur.rashid] I manually copied the static file. I think we need network to open the port to connect the two. I'll email them.


author: 5b1ee5a72eea651bacdeca2e
comment: [~mamunur.rashid] Can you send an email to Network with the server and port to open? I'm not sure what are all the ports you need. Thanks.

author: phoebe.george
comment: [~mamunur.rashid] [~Tin.Chak] TFSL had the following questions - can you confirm?
 # External File timing
 # Is there a specific time this is typically generated by InfoIMAGE and sent to TF?
 # And based on the generation time, is there an associated cutoff time for customer preference changes? (i.e. if file generates at 3pm it will include customer changes up until 2pm)
 # We assume any customer preference changes after the cutoff time would be included in the next days file then, correct?


 # Meta File timing
 # Our job runs nightly and will populate the file(s) into the SFTP in the early morning hours for delivery. Is it correct then that statement notifications will go out later that day at 5pm PST (8pm EST)?


author: 5b1ee5a72eea651bacdeca2e
comment: [~mamunur.rashid] I posted a Zoom message to look at the onbase error. Can you follow up with the PD team if you haven't heard back? The pilot is tomorrow, so we really need this to be up.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~mamunur.rashid] I received your message, and checking with TFSL if the pre-enrolled accounts existing in onbase for testing.

[~nprimak] [~Igor.Khosid] in the meantime, can you complete your QA for the other areas of the site (disclosure links, etc)? The bank actually already has access to the pilot via SSO and so i wanted to ensure these other areas are good.




author: mamunur.rashid
comment: [~phoebe.george],

The answer to your questions about external enrollment report timing is as follows:
 # There is no specific time to generate the report. But we need to generate the report every day at the same time.
 # As the client wanted an incremental file that's why the report will contains the data of previous 24 hours from the report generation time.
 # There is no suchassociated cutoff time.
 # About meta-file timing, I think Anil is working on that. So he can answer the question about that. Please talk with him.

comment: [~mamunur.rashid] For the custom footer, can you do some analysis on it and give me the estimate hours to implement?

[~phoebe.george] This will be billable since it's an enhancement that we need to do. Please don't promised to the client that we can do it yet, only mention that we are looking into it.

Thanks.


author: mamunur.rashid
comment: [~Tin.Chak],

Implementation of the custom footer won't take long but some new flags need to be introduced for the custom footer, left side image, and right side image.

Should I start implementing it?


author: mamunur.rashid
comment: [~Tin.Chak],

Another thing is that DNS is not still added for extproxy 11 and 12 on ca-utils-pr-01. That's why I can't deploy new cosmetic changes from jenkins. I already committed the changes on main_pilot branch.

And TFSL wanted the statement date to be changed to month-day-year format. But hypercube only supports year-month-day format for statement date.

author: phoebe.george
comment: [~mamunur.rashid] Can you provide a test external enrollment file for a FULL file, along with a 'partial/incremental' file? The bank would like to test both on their end before they determine which version they use for production. Thanks!

comment: [~phoebe.george] The estimated hours to implement the custom footer is 8 hrs. Please confirm with the bank. This is billable.

author: mamunur.rashid
comment: [~Tin.Chak],

I need your feedback on the incremental external enrollment report. Do you remember I told you that those accounts will be included in the report file whose delivery preference and notification preference both are modified? If only DP or only NP is modified then those accounts will not be in the report file. This is why I can't provide an incremental file that [~phoebe.george]is talking about.

[~phoebe.george],

I will provide you with both incremental and full file after getting Sean's feedback on the incremental file.

Thanks.


author: 5b1ee5a72eea651bacdeca2e
comment: [~mamunur.rashid] For the incremental external enrollment report, can you add a configuration with the "OR" condition instead of "AND" for the both modified by. Basically, we don't want to affect the existing client while we evaluate this some more.

Network also added the internal DNS for all the new pilot proxy,

There may be one or two test accounts in the file which is created from SSO on our side.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~mamunur.rashid] Can you confirm if the full file is based on changes since the pilot testing started with the client? 

Also, how difficult would it be to provide these daily for a certain period of time so they can track the changes for testing? Like a few days or 1 week?

Thanks,

Phoebe


author: mamunur.rashid
comment: [~phoebe.george],

Yes, the full file contains data from the beginning of the pilot testing.

There is no way to set a date range to pull data for a certain period of time. Either a full file or incremental (daily file containing 24 hours of data)will be generated.

author: JIRAUSER11400
comment: [~mamunur.rashid] Client has questions about leading 0

Per Client: !image001.jpg!

In the pre-enrollment and meta files InfoIMAGE had told us to not include the leading 0 in our account #. What we noticed in testing though is that in InfoTrac when the 9 digit account # (without the leading 0) is searched and selected it does not display the customer information or allow you to make a delivery preference change for the customer. .



If you remove the exact search box and then search the 9 digit # the account will appear twice  once with the leading zero and once without. If you select the account +with+ the leading 0 it has the customer information and the option to change their eDelivery. The SSO is sending the account over with the leading 0.



Can we please discuss prior to Thursday so we understand how this functions and if we need to make any code changes on our side to include the 0? There are 2 examples below for a visual.




author: mamunur.rashid
comment: [~Ricky Lopez],

For TFSL*removeAccountLeadingZero* flag was false in infoconfig. That's why while accounts with leading zero were passed from SSO it was creating new accounts with leading zeros. This happens only for those accounts that were created from SSO. Accounts created from pre-enrollment are okay.

I set this flag to true. I hope it will work fine from now.

This external enrollment file has User_Name appended at the end of the line. Please review and let me know the client's feedback.

comment: [~mamunur.rashid] Can you take a look at the page I attached for testing? The issue with the old statement listing page showing is still there. When I go from the first account that is on paper to another account, the first account's statement is visible for a split second. I'm able to open the statement if I click fast enough.

I saw the issue. I think it's an existing bug. Our QA tried to regenerate the issue on Stage. She got it on stage also. And it's happening for other clients too.

As it is a global issue we should create another ticket and start coding to solve this issue.
