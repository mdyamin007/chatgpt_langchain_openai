comment: [~andreav]updated sample: [^CENTEA11-1.pdf]

I tried to match the font the best I could. As for the orphan word this is part of the datafile provided and cannot be changed.


author: andreav
comment: Thanks Jason, the sample looks OK to me now with the exception of the grainy return address. Not sure if that is an image issue for due to pdf conversion in program. Other than that, I think we can forward to client for feedback. [~shailendrar] - Let me know if you agree. We'll need to inform the client of the orphans in the data.


author: shailendrar
comment: [~andreav]- Agreed. Please go ahead and share the samples with client.


author: JIRAUSER11003
comment: [~andreav]can you please specify the text that thisgrainy, so I can work on making it more clear. Is it just the website and the phone number?


author: andreav
comment: [~jasonV] - Sorry, spoke too soon. The address block does not appear to be corrected to use Arial 8pt. Can you check and provide new sample?


author: JIRAUSER11003
comment: [~andreav]Shail, Peter, and I discussed this yesterday. Here is the updated sample with Arial 8pt.

comment: Client approved the pdf print samples on 5/24 but reported the blue color is a little dark. This will be adjusted if needed after the client sees the physical samples .
Pending approval on the physical samples on 5/26.
Please move print to QA. Please provide the new dpvs once the body is shifted down so title does not show in envelope wiindow and the USPS endorsement is added.
