UPDATE: During testing this enhancement, there is 1 layer we are requesting isn't being updated at the moment. Can we please get this part updated:

In Comment #7 FFFC_MbrAcctXref_MMDDYYYY.txt.gpg is backup in /d/download/ folder. I don't think we need to store in /home/keep/ again

Request:

Please look for the Xref file in download for processes not seg 1. We are manually having to move the file to the bu folder after each process.
