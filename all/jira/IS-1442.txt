comment: Hi [~Tevis Mak], please see following from OPS:

please see DL 007 below. I believe the customer was going for the 50% shading on all sectional headers? Shouldn't the top header match the grayscale shading of the bottom one? If so, programmer should enter same grayscale values for both areas. All daily Ltrs recently submitted for test have the same issue as below. Please advise

Please adjust 1st section header to match the second section header (lighter shade).

Thanks

comment: Hi [~dyuen],

I just double checked that all the greyscale has the same value for DL001-006. Can you please confirm it?

Thanks,
Tevis

[~Tevis Mak], per attached email, we will not be proceeding with the shading updates. The original setting will be kept.

Please cancel Jira.

Thanks!

comment: Hi [~Tevis Mak], per SCRUM meeting, [~Peter.Dang]and [~yameelee]will actually change the percentage for the shading. Peter and Yamee wants to try doing a few different shading variations; one sample with 35%, 40% and 45%. Can you provide samples?

Thanks
