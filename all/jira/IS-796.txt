OFCU wants a XML statement for every 100 PDF statements for each batch of statements?
There were some issues with some statements not processing and this would cause the batch to fail. They  found that some business names contained special characters which XML does not allow. Could you  use Escape Sequence code when these special characters are found?
Symbol (name) -> Escape Sequence
& (ampersand) -> &#38;
' (apostrophe or single quote) -> &#39;

I am a bit confuse regarding the special character.

The XML index file sample are using escape characters for special characters. Do they want to go the opposite and not use the escape character?

Also, will it be acceptable to have all the PDF and all the XML batches, in one zip encrypted return file?

comment: Hi [~jira_naru],

I will check with them.

Thanks, Barnett

comment: Hi [~jira_naru],

For creating an XML index file for every 100 PDF statements in a given batch, OFCU wants One zip file containing all the PDF statements (as is currently), along with all the split XML index files.

Thanks, Barnett

Let me know regarding the special characters in the member name.

Currently, in the XML sample provided it has the escape characters for those special characters. See snap shot above.

So, the question is, do we want to keep the ESCAPE character or leave those SPECIAL characters as is.

comment: Hi [~jira_naru],

They want us to use Escape Sequence code when these special characters are found.

Thanks, Barnett

OFCU noticed that the balances are not centered in the box for all the statements. Screenshot (Screenshot_2.28.22) is attached. Can you please advise if this can  !Screenshot_2.28.22.png|thumbnail! be fixed?

Thanks, Barnett

comment: Barnett:

The centering the balances in the box is outside of the scope of this request or update.

You will need, to initiate PR accordingly.
