title: BKPL Monthly Update - No Check Image Files
description: Bkpl monthly data (cycle 1103) has only the STM file.There is no IDX or IMG file for that cycle.
The data may have few number of customers and no customer may have check images.
That's why the cycle don't have any IDX and IMG file
BA requesting to update the script, so that even if there is no IDX and IMG file, the process must go on.
