 This is an update in script only.
 If a the data file contains the line
 *"No data exists for LN2200P today"*
 then the script will send an email to internal. I've already forwarded you the mail which looks like this

comment: [~fahad]: I don't see the program transfer form again! This was the same issue last time. Please make program transfer form is attached so that [~TunA]can help release the code.



[~phoebe.george]: The original live date was 11/19. Since it just got passed, i've updatd live date to be 11/23 to give enough time for us to release code.

comment: Hi [~William.Kong],
 My apology for that. I thought transfer form is supposed to get provided for new application setup. So should we provide transfer form for all the update release even if it's a single existing resource?

Hi [~phoebe.george],

I've attached the transfer form.
 Thanks

comment: [~phoebe.george]: We missed the live date yesterday. Please advise if there is any issue b/c of this.



[~fahad]: Transfer form is required for all project. Tun/Peter/YaMee may not know the details and will rely on the transfer form for code. If there are special instruction that is not code related like (e.g. Please help me copy this abcefgh list to /home/keep/xyz, etc.. then it needs to be documented there so that they know)



[~Peter.Dang] : Transfer form is attached above. Can you please help release after our DSi scrum meeting today if [~phoebe.george]has no issues with it.

comment: [~William.Kong] no issue on the customer side; DP is handling manually in the meantime if there is an empty file flagged.

Please confirm once released today and I'll update DP.
