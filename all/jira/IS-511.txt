comment: Hi Le, Tohid made updates to the logo and return address on the Monthly Statements based on client feedback. I asked him to share the specs with you so that you can make the changes on your end as well.
Once you make the update, please provide a dpvs so we can send updated physical samples to the client tomorrow if possible. 


author: andreav
comment: One more thing Le, please change the logo from color to Black and White in the archival and provide a new archival sample file for client approval.

Hi Andrea,

Attached is dpvs.

Please be advised that I reverted back to the old service code to get the dpvs since we're currently having an issue with the new service code.

comment: Le, client confirmed there is no additional feedback. Please make the updates based on the feedback from 1/6 and provide the final samples.


author: andreav
comment: Feedback from 1/6 in case you need it:

1.	The masking for account numbers is still reverse.  This is an issue we previously reported.
XDI:
 !Feedback 1a.png|thumbnail! 
InfoIMAGE:
 !Feedback 1b.png|thumbnail! 

I had to erase the numbers so we do give our account info, but I hope you get the gist here.

2.	Resize the Payment Information box when there is no Minimum Payment Warning.  Otherwise it looks funny like something is missing.  Example page 4 member name Seal.  We want the box to shrink to just fit the Payment Information and Late Payment Warning and then start the body of the statement.

comment: Hi Le, the client is asking if we really need the message files since they are not going to have selective messages at go live so this is pending William's response. If we don't , then we can use the latest test files the client sent: 

 !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! 

Here is the new DT_JOB_ID to use once William gives the go ahead to process: 139093-C00.01-V22698
Once processed, please post on InfoTRAC and give Ethan a new index file for posting.


author: andreav
comment: Also, client responded on the Ending Balance Field and Record, See email below. Looks like someone already updated the SOW as well but the field and record are different than what the client confirmed. {color:red}Will, can you clarify?{color}

Client reponse:
.  Yes, for the Message Manager marketing criteria Ending Balance, for credit cards loans you will use the same value as  New Balance on the credit card statements.
 !screenshot-2.png|thumbnail! 

SOW:
5.	Ending Balance (R:580   F:02)  Use the New Balance field for Ending Balance criteria.
