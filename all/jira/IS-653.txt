Will there be a turnover meeting for this? Or already happened , I forgot.

Thanks


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~rony] Yes, we had it on Tuesday, 12/7 - it was combined with the HSA/IRA turnover too :) 

If you can let me know target sample date, I can finish the timeline to share with the team. Thanks!


author: phoebe.george
comment: Sample date provided is 12/31/21 for all of the tax forms. Here is the updated timeline:

All the taxes Samples are in this attached zip. All of the samples are generated in local.
Thanks.

author: phoebe.george
comment: [~fahad] They look good, sent to STAR for feedback/approval. Thanks!


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~fahad] One of the feedback items from STAR is the following:
 # All InfoImage tax forms are missing the verbiage For Debtor, For Recipient, For Participant depending on the form type (missing this under Copy B verbiage)

Is this verbiage provided in the data file for the front of the tax form? I wanted to confirm that first before I responded - all the other questions they brought up just need my response, but no other changes reported so far. Will confirm once they complete their review but wanted to provide this question in the meantime. Thanks!


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~fahad] just wanted to confirm if you can confirm my question in my previous comment? Thank you!


author: JIRAUSER10910
comment: Hi [~phoebe.george],
Sorry I didn't understand where should the verbages you mentioned should be. As all of the data's are printed as is please provide me a mapping of based on what we should put those verbages and where.

Thanks.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~fahad] I have attached the examples of the verbiage that is not on the samples we provided. However, wanted to check first if this is coming across in the data file. Thanks!

author: JIRAUSER10910
comment: Hi [~phoebe.george],
Yes they are in data file. I will fix it in the next sample. Or do you want me to fix it now and send another sample by tomorrow? please advise
Thanks


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~fahad] Thanks, this was actually the only feedback needed for changes; all other items was just a confirmation that i was able to address. Please re-send samples when ready, and I can get final approval for print. Thanks!


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~fahad] Will you still have updated samples ready today by chance? Thanks!


author: JIRAUSER10910

Thanks.

author: phoebe.george
comment: [~fahad] Thank you, samples have been sent to customer for final approval. Note that an additional prod file arrived for 1099MISC, the file name was sent via zoom chat. 

Also, please start to prepare back-end processing script in preparation for DPVS's - I'm trying to get QA scheduled for next week so that we are able to print and mail by EOM after parallel testing. Thank you!


author: JIRAUSER10910
comment: Hi [~phoebe.george],
Attached is the fixed 5498-ESA sample and1099-MISC PROD data sample.
FYI, all the samples are generated in local.
Thanks.
[^1099MISC.pdf][^5498-ESA.pdf]


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~fahad] Thank you, these have been sent to STAR for final approval.

As discussed via zoom chat, you still need to finish the script for these to prepare for QA. In reviewing the timeline, we will be very behind schedule if not completed until end of this week. Please let us know if this can be done sooner, as we have to print and mail all tax production files by end of the month, and need to still complete final QA and parallel testing. Anything that can be done to push this sooner and/or prioritize would be much appreciated. Thank you!


author: phoebe.george
comment: The Tax Samples are APPROVED based on the samples provided for the 2021 data.

Once the scripting is completed, please prepare DPVS's and for QA. Thank you!


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~fahad] I know that you are working on both taxes and the HSA/IRA setups, but taxes also need to be mailed by the 31st. Please confirm status of this project as well when you are able to. Thanks again!


author: JIRAUSER10910
comment: Hi [~phoebe.george],
I provided full status update on IS-441. I'll start work on tomorrow again. When I finish work tomorrow I'll provide another update again. Thanks.

[~Igor.Khosid] FYI for now, I'll prepare approved samples and SOW links tonight or tomorrow morning.
