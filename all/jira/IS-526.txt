title: UFCU - Update to handle empty file for Adverse Action Letter
description: For Adverse Action Letters Letter 005, please remove condition to check for greater than zero line in data file.

/home/master/ufcudla_process.sh

"elif [[ ${base_filename} == AdverseActionLetter_[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9].* && $file_line -gt 0 ]]"



Per client, this AdverseActionLetter_YYYYMMDD.txt file can be empty occasion. Per this new business rule, we can skip this file. Please test this condition out to make sure program still continues without error.
