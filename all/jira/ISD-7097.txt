*InfoTRAC*:
1. Currently the upload insert form accepts only_application/pdf_ types. This form needs updating to also accept_text/html._
2. In the form submissioncontroller, previously as only one type of upload was supported, the_fileType_to set on the_Email_Attach_table was hardcoded to "application/pdf". This setter needs to be made dynamic.
3. After uploading InfoTRAC shows a list of all uploaded inserts on a list view. Clicking the link will open the document on another tab. This functionality is currently only implementedto support pdf documents. We need to add another functionality to support html documents too.

*InfoSERVICE*:
1. We may need to update the document search/all API to include the presentment type(pdf/html) for inserts. Currently this API returns a_fileType_value that contains the file_type column value from the_Inventroy_Pdfs_table. But the fileType is returned for only the "selective" types inserts. For "global" type inserts this_fileType_is being replaced by the_stmtType's_value. So for "global" type inserts, Hypercube has no way to know which type of file to expect to show to the client. For this reason, we may need to explicitly add a presentment type for inserts.

*Hypercube*:
1. We will need to update the view template (eStatement.html), the view helper (eStatement.js) and also the mainRoutes file to implement the logic for viewing the insert document based on the presentment type returned from API.

Considering the initial setup needed to run InfoTRAC and InfoSERVICE on my local machine for the first time, here is the work hour estimation (including testing) to implement the feature:

InfoTRAC and InfoSERVICE: 45 hours
Hypercube: 28 hours
