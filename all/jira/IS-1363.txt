comment: Hi [~Natalie.Tom],

Per SSCU,
I noticed that the Equal Housing Opportunity logo is missing from the bottom of the letter. It looks like InfoImage will need to possibly move the If you filed paragraph up a little then add the logo

Credit union address cut off in tap right test.


author: JIRAUSER11103
comment: [~avannik] 
The position of the credit union address is like that for all their letters so I'm not sure how it's having that issue.


author: gthillaivel
comment: [~Natalie.Tom] When we do the tap test ,the full return address should display on the window.Right now it's hidden few text

[~barnetts]--If you think ,this is acceptable.QA will pass with notes.Pl Advise


author: JIRAUSER11103
comment: [~gthillaivel]
I meant that I didn't change the position of the logo in the dfa so I'm not sure how this one is cut off if the position is the same on the dfa for all of the letters in this application.
