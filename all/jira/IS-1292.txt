comment: Hi [~jharvey],

Can you help me out with the mappings of these two fields. The field number 650 doesn't exist in the data file so which field should be mapped?

Also confused about the Days field which field from data file needs to get mapped? The screenshot is attached below.

Thankyou.

This is not ready to be released, client has not approved samples and has additional change requests.

I do have an update on our issue with the current Loan Type range(s).  Because it's been discovered that there are some loans within the provided ranges that should NOT have this new LOC/HELOC formatting done, we've made the decision to simply provide all of the individual Loan Types that should.  We realize that this will require us to provide updates each time a new qualifying loan is created in our core along with a work order to be approved, but we don't currently have a better options.

So, please update the code to only apply the new LOC/HELOC formatting for these Loan Types:

 502, 602, 603, 699, 1002, 1006, 1028, 1029, 1030, 1032, 1033

Please see info from client below.

Reviewing the last samples provided and we're not seeing any of the transaction tests we did.  I'm wondering if the team provided samples from a previous statement file.



Please ensure they use the attached file and please provide samples again.

The client did some transaction testing in the test file they provided to make sure that the transactions would be reflected in the samples we provided.  Did you use the test file  LOC & HELOC STMT Test File 07152022 (1) to create the most recent samples?

Client wants to put this on hold.  They want to submit actual data in August EOM file for us to produce samples from.  They do not want this code released until October.  Should we put the status as on hold or just update the timeline?


author: JIRAUSER11500
comment: Hi [~jharvey]



Okay, you can put the status as on hold for now than.

comment: [~Sheikh_Fahim]

The client reached out in regards to this project today.  They would like us to provide some samples from the August EOM file for them to review and then Go Live before September ends.

They also have some new loan ranges that need to added. As discussed, we need to add some Loan Types to the existing list for the LOC/HELOC updates. 
These are the new Loan Types to add to what we've already established: 1031, 1034, 1035, 1036, 1037

Here is the complete list. We can have a range for most of our business LOCs (let me know if that's an issue: 502, 602, 603, 699, 1002, 1006 1028-1037


author: JIRAUSER11500
comment: Hi [~jharvey]



Yes do let me know when the August EOM files arrives for testing with the newly added Loan Types.

Thanks


author: JIRAUSER11500
comment: Hi [~jharvey]

I used the data file of August EOMSTA.5A.083122.zip.pgp.

There is account which doesn't contain the field number 650 which is under the given loan type list but we are supposed to extract the data from the 31st field for Balance Subject to interest Rate. The screenshot is attached below you can see the account type is 602 but there is no 650 field for extracting the value of Balance Subject to Interest Rate for the table.

comment: [~Sheikh_Fahim]

Would you please provide the member number for this account?  


author: JIRAUSER11500
comment: Hi [~jharvey]

The Account Number is 42516

Thanks


author: jharvey
comment: [~Sheikh_Fahim]

Please see client's comment in regards to account 42516 below.  He also has a request for us to send him a list of any accounts that has this occurrence. He would like us to create a report that contains the Member Number and Loan ID (Not Loan Type)  Are we able to do that?

Ok, I've been able to confirm that in this case the loan was closed on 8/5 and we didn't add the Tracking Records to our Prod environment until 8/25.  So that is why the 650 Record was missing.

That shouldn't be an issue in the future (since the Tracking Records exist in there going forward), but just in case, if it does, please continue on, add the boxes to the statement and if any data is missing please leave those fields blank.  Then please provide a list of member numbers affected.


author: JIRAUSER11500
comment: Hi [~jharvey]

According to my analysis those accounts that have the matching loan type but doesn't contain the 650 field is attached below:

file:[^Account_Id_&_Loan_Id.txt]

Also let me knw which data file should i use to generate new samples with the newly added loan types.

Thanks


author: jharvey
comment: [~Sheikh_Fahim]

Will we be able to generate that list as a report for the client each time we process these files?

The EOM file is apcu/dda/STA.5A.083122.zip.pgp they may not have all of the new loan types, because some of them do not exist yet, but they want us to program for them so they can just use the range once the new loan types are created.



author: rony
comment: Hi [~jharvey]

Yes, we can, normally this would be a billable request.

Can the client provide the report name to generate?

And what we should do in formatting if the 650 or 599 is missing, should we suppress displaying the related(YTD/Balance to interest) section?

[~Sheikh_Fahim]

Thanks


author: jharvey
comment: [~rony]  [~Sheikh_Fahim]

Would you be able to provide how many additional hours it would take to setup the report?

I will ask the client what name he would like.  The client would like the YTD/Balance to interest section to display blank in the boxes. 


author: jharvey
comment: [~Sheikh_Fahim]

Please see client's request below.
Can you please provide samples for the accounts below using the most recent statement file?  Let me know if you have any questions, thank you!

author: jharvey
comment: [~Sheikh_Fahim]

Are you able to provide a breakdown of the 5 hours for setting up the report?


author: jharvey
comment: [~Sheikh_Fahim]

Please see feedback from client regarding samples provided.

The first sample for member ( 1219310-0701) doesn't actually include their personal LOC (0701).  It just has the savings (0001).

Then directly after, it looks like another member was included that we did not ask for (1219311 - Yvonne M Corwin).  Not sure why this member was included as they do not have any LOC/HELOC, but I'm guessing it has to do with whatever issues caused the first samples to not include their LOC.

Can you please have the team review and provide new samples?


author: JIRAUSER11500
comment: Hi [~jharvey]

I don't see any personal LOC (0701) section for the account number1219310-0701 the field 500 doesn't exist for this account. The screenshot from the data file is attached below

!apcums21_accountno_1219310.PNG|width=886,height=533!

I have used the data fileSTA.5A.083122.zip.pgp



Thanks




author: jharvey
comment: [~Sheikh_Fahim]

Please see client's response, sorry for the confusion.

This account didn't get their LOC until 9/7/2022 so of course this would not have existed in last month's statement file.  I apologize, i will talk to the person who provided that account,  I'll provide a replacement, thank you!


author: JIRAUSER11500
comment: Hi [~jharvey]

The breakdown for setting up the report as follows

The report has 2 parts one for formatting another one for scripting

In the formatting part we have to read the Dfa and check those accounts that doesn't have that 650 and 599 field for those specific loan type accounts and generate a report

And in the scripting part we have to create the report according to the naming convention the client will tell , implement a pgp encryption to the report file before placing it to the client pickup , check whether a report has been created before while this script was running we need to remove those existing file.

So, total breakdown

Scripting: 2 hours

Formatting: 2 hours

Testing : 1 hour

Total 5 hours.

Thanks.


author: jharvey
comment: [~Sheikh_Fahim]

Thank you, the client has decided not to move forward with the report.  So please disregard that part of the request.  Please see his feedback about the sample provided below.

Joye for the samples we found an amount that was incorrect for 106304 for the Loan ID 0501.  The amount listed is "$99.52", but in the statement file it is  $9,52.31.  It appears as though the amount was cut off or truncated somehow (see screenshots below).  The weird part is that for their Loan ID 0700 which is right below it in the statement has the correct amount displaying.  So, this isn't happening to the other LOC in for the same member or on any of the other samples we looked at.

Screenshot from the statement sample

The client has additional changes they are requesting below.  We need to have this ready to go to QA and parallel by Friday 09/23/2022, will you be able to make these changes and provide new samples by 09/21? 

Unfortunately, our lawyer had some additional changes that we need to make to ensure we're meeting every requirement of this change.  These are fairly simply changes (I think), but I understand we're against the wall on time.  If there is anyway we can make these changes and still meet the end of month go-live that would be great, but if simply not possible I understand.  Please let me know.

Here are the two changes.
1)    We need to add two asterisks next to the Balance Subject to Interest Rate. Then, below the box well need this exact verbiage:

** = Average Daily Balance Method (For more information contact us using the phone number at the bottom of page 1)
 !screenshot-5.png|thumbnail! 
2)    We need to have the following verbiage added to the statement put it directly below the NEXT PAYMENT DUE DATE and above the REPAYMENT AMOUNT
Late Payment Warning: If we do not receive your minimum payment within 15 days of  the due date listed above, you may have to pay a late fee of up to $30, depending on loan type.

Master Parallel Ticket 34021 has been assigned to Fahim.

comment: Hi [~jharvey]

We can skip parallel. There are no processing-related changes, no new logo, backer, or simplex duplex issue. So we can go straight to release.

Fahim,

I will relay your information to the client, he is out of the office until the end of the week.  As soon as he provides an update I will comment here. 


author: JIRAUSER11500
comment: Hi [~jharvey]

Any feedback from the client?

Thanks


author: jharvey
comment: [~Sheikh_Fahim]

The client is working on how to pull the fee from the feedback #1  question into the statement.  They are also working on adding a field for us to pull a date from.  I have a meeting with them today and should have an ETA of a new test file that will contain that information. 


author: JIRAUSER11500

Do let me know when client provides the new test files and mapping.

Please see attached document with updates from client.  Please use this information to create new samples from September EOM file. [^apcu 28305 updates.docx] 


author: JIRAUSER11500
comment: Hi [~jharvey]

Can you ask the client for a list of account number from the September EOM file so that i can generate the samples with the new changes.

Thanks.


author: jharvey
comment: [~Sheikh_Fahim]

Please see the sample list the client provided below.  Also, please see additional information the client added.

1219310-0701
1281979-0701
106304-0700
1278048-0500

1238435 - 0701
1083123 - 0701
112163 - 0701

I want to be clear that in the Fees Charged Box, we want both Insurance charges AND Late Fees to display both the amount and description.  I think I was clear with that for the Insurance Charges, but I think I only listed the field for the amount for the Late Fee.

In case there was any confusion, please look in Record 530, Field 04 for the Late Fee Amount.  And look in Record 530, Field 08 for the Late Charge description.


author: JIRAUSER11500
comment: Hi [~jharvey]

The update samples are attached below :[^apcums2130.pdf]

So, I have used the field from 530 field 04 for the Fees charged section and for Insurance charged I have checked whether 530 23rd field has an I value or not and extracted Amount from field 03 and Description from field 08. Both Insurance and Fees charged were included in this new sample.

Thanks

Sheikh, client is asking:

Did the programmers provide any insight into the second issue? Where the member with multiple LOC loans had their "Balance Subject to Interest Rate" swapped?

Like I said before it's is the only issue to come up multiple times and so my concern is that we ensure it is solved.

I have reviewed the code this issue won't repeat again.
