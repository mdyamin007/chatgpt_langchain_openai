Attached a few PDF samples created from estmt+archival. Let me know if I need to copy whole samples.

If print samples are required please request samples with attached DPVS because print is from eform.

comment: Hi [~jun], 

UCCU wants a clearer logo. Can you please advise if this possible? 
Per UCCU, Our Marketing team reviewed the Account, Consumer Visa, and HELOC statement samples and have some concerns with the clarity of the logo. It looks really pixilated. When we reviewed the samples provided at the end of last year the logo was much sharper and they were wondering if this is simply due to the pdf rendering or if the logo will look this way on print and eStatements. Our graphic designer is wondering if you are able to use "vector artwork" for printing so that it's not pixel-dependent?

Thanks, Barnett

Per Mike,
"The printed perf is actually correct. I went back and double checked the stock I used and I mustve loaded 3.5 perf by mistake."
