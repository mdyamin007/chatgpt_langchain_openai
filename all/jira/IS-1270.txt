comment: Attached are the cycles that include the VI indicators (spreadsheet) that can be used for testing.



Note from the client:

_Cycle CK02 is run the evening of the third Monday of the month which you would then receive the Tuesday Morning after that. Cycles CK10 and CKOR are run at month end._
_We added one of my accounts to the CK02 cycle. The account number is 67291602 and it should be there for the July 18th run which you will receive on July 19th._

Just checking in if you have any questions so far about this new project? We are going to have our weekly status call with the client tomorrow morning. Please let us know if there is anything you'd like to check with them.



Thank you,

Juliana


author: nischala.manjunath
comment: [~Juliana Vannik] - No questions as of now. I found a couple of files in production that have the VI indicator, will use one of them for samples. Thanks!


author: JIRAUSER11300
comment: Hi [~nischala.manjunath],

We are having next status call with this client tomorrow. Is there any progress and/or questions on this project? 
Also is there a chance to get the samples sooner please? This client is asking to go live faster if possible, so that would be highly appreciated.
Please let us know.

Thank you,
Juliana

comment: Hi [~Juliana Vannik] - Still working on samples. Sorry, I don't think I can provide samples earlier than 07/20. Working on other projects that are due sooner. Will let you know if I have any questions. Thanks!


author: nischala.manjunath
comment: [~Juliana Vannik] [~phoebe.george], Sample - provms1_sample.pdf is placed in your ac-secure-share directories. VI statements are on page 1, 645 and 657. Thanks!

comment: Hi [~nischala.manjunath] ,

Please note the following updates from the client for the samples provided:



1. The first page backer was not present

2. They would like to move part of the summary section (top of page 3) to page 2. 

Please see the client's sample and notes attached:

Thank you,

author: nischala.manjunath
comment: [~Juliana Vannik] -  I think the backer is part of the preprint and will show up when printed. This was just a pdf of the paper sample. Let me know if you'd like to request print samples.
Working on the other update. Thanks!


author: nischala.manjunath
comment: [~Juliana Vannik], sample is attached  [^provms11c30.qa.pdf]. Please note that this doesn't contain the backer. 
DPVS  [^provms11c30.print] is attached to request print samples if necessary. File to print is provms11c30.qa.afp. Thanks!

comment: [~nischala.manjunath], thank you! The file has been emailed to the client for the final approval. I will update as soon as they reply

comment: Hi [~nischala.manjunath] ,

The final sample has been approved. 

There is a question for printing, what did you code for, and if the paper trays changed?

Could you also please produce the e-index file for pilot site posting for the approved sample?

Thank you,

Juliana




author: nischala.manjunath
comment: [~Juliana Vannik] - Paper trays are the same.

[~nischala.manjunath] - Please attach IS checklist


author: JIRAUSER11300
comment: Hi [~nischala.manjunath],

Please note the client commented that the posted VI sample does not include the marketing message on the first page.

1. We would like to confirm if it is because it was created in pilot (tied to message manager in pilot)?

2. Could you also confirm that the OMR/IMB barcodes will not display on the e-version as well please?



Thank you,
Juliana



[~phoebe.george] FYI




author: nischala.manjunath
comment: Hi [~Juliana Vannik] - 
1) I didn't create a new campaign for message manager while processing this cycle for samples which is why the marketing message was missing on pilot. My change is unrelated to it so didn't think it was necessary. Marketing message will show up when processed in production. 
2) I don't see OMR/IMB barcodes on the current output for eStatements, they won't be included.
Thanks!
