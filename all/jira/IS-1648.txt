*ASSESSMENT:*

1hr - Modify script to get ESMO & ESQO counts.

1hr - QA & Testing

*NOTES FOR DEV*: please update script to create a counts txt file of all ESMO & ESQO counts. One suggestion is to grep the data file like below:

Store into variables for ESMO and ESQO counts and redirect counts in variables to a txt file with the following naming convention "CAMB_ESMO_ESQO_COUNTS_${filedate}.txt". Then email txt file to client. Please use emails in external mail list. Contents of file should look like below:



ESMO = <Volume>

ESQU = <Volume>



*TIMELINE:*

Turnover = 9/28

Sample to QA = 9/29

NO PARALLEL

Live Date = 9/29

Attached the count file that was tested locally since the quarter end file is very large.

Thanks!

Please release and confirm what day the client should be expecting this.

comment: [~MattL] - Since return mail conversion for DDA is already in parallel I merged this code with that. Are we releasing all the return mail projects to production tomorrow?


author: mattl
comment: Hi Yes, but we may receive their EOM cycle tonight, so if we could release this today that would be helpful.


author: JIRAUSER11100
comment: [~MattL] - Nischala has to release the code. Do you want this update to be released to production for EOM cycle and not the return mail. I noticed that you have asked her to release it tomorrow morning.


author: JIRAUSER11100
comment: [~MattL] - Since we merged the code both will be released at the same time.


author: mattl
comment: Okay!




author: JIRAUSER11100
comment: Code merged with DDA script IS-1398 and released to production.


author: mattl
comment: Hi [~rukmaniR]client changed their mind, they would like to suppress if count is zero.
