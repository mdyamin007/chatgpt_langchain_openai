comment: Hi [~Peter.Dang]

I guess [~andyp]took care of LN 6 , so we will just go with LN1-LN4.

Thanks

comment: [~rony] [~Peter.Dang] [~fahad] - following up to confirm if there is a live date set. As mentioned to peter, Data Center and I have been manually running suppression lists daily based on pulling the print suppression lists for each of the LN applications. Thanks!

Code released


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~fahad] [~rony] was this update for Billing Notice as well, 'LN6'? I checked in production and Blling Notices still had the posted accounts for addresses that had the asterisks. Thanks!




author: phoebe.george
comment: [~fahad] Sorry, I was mistaken, it's actually not LN6 that had the issue. I believe Andy is taking care of that one. The prefixes you worked on were released for LN1 - LN4.

[~Peter.Dang] [~William.Kong] I don't believe the updates included Billing Notices; DP let me know that this prefix is bn1. Can this be added/updated with this change as well?


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~fahad] [~rony] [~Peter.Dang] [~William.Kong] Per my last comment please confirm if the Billing Notices (LN file) was also updated; this is bn1 prefix per DP.


author: JIRAUSER10910
comment: Hi [~phoebe.george],
I've only worked on Ln1- Ln4. I didn't work on bn1.
Thanks.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~Peter.Dang] The Billing Notice file (LN2200 file/application) was missed on the original assessment on ticket #22782. Can we add a story for this ASAP, or do you need a new Jira ticket?


author: william.kong
comment: [~phoebe.george]: [~Peter.Dang]shockingly returned to work today. He's catching up like crazy. For sure we need another Jira ticket. BN1 was coded by Hosein and I don't know who [~Peter.Dang]has in mind to work on it. We will need to add additional 4 hour quotation based on how I read the description of work above. Will this project need to go live by 12/28/2021 last year as well? (j/k) Please advise the expectation on the live date because [~Peter.Dang]will need to see who can fit this in next month because the current due date is set at 12/28/2021; Not sure if we fit this into Jan 2022.



[~Peter.Dang]: Please identify a resource to assist on BN1.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~Peter.Dang] Epic IMPL-1875 created, along with corresponding Story to assign specific to Billing Notice/prefix bn1.
