Also, Menlo PC department and will need to test this out as well.  Can you open up the RDP port from Menlo Park DataCenter to access the PC as well

comment: [~kent.chan] and [~premraj.patil]: I'm changing this priority higher now.  PC team needs to use this machine in order for us to do our testing on next Monday. I would like PC to play around with this machine this week to report any issues. By Friday, they will need to start create Dockets for Brisbane testing. Please see if you can get this resolved first thing tomorrow morning.
