Run through test to ensure it does not autotrigger e-autopost.

comment: * Modified bbbbds1_process.sh to export g_max_cripple_num and g_cripple_report instead of exporting _high_cripple_flag_ because _high_cripple_flag_ is not being set and exported by the time _move_afp_threads.sh_ is called (as it is called by _isisdisk.sh_, which runs earlier in the processing script). Note that cripple information cannot be retrieved until_isisdisk.sh_ finishes running. With this solution, _move_afp_threads.sh_ executes the already written _cripple_checker_, using exported variables g_max_cripple_num and g_cripple_report.
 * Processed on RHS2 with high cripple rate, verified that eStatement is not auto-posted.

This update to prevent autotrigger of estatement posting while there is high cripple rate (3% or more) is ready for review.

Note: I verified that there's no estmt auto-posting by checking that no entry exists in /z/daily/index_file.log for the most recent run of the job, indicating that /home/test/master/I3.socket.pl was not called and so processing of estmt was not initiated.
