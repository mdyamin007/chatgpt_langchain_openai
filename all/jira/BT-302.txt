comment: [~gthillaivel] Most of the accounts posted fine, seems like a data file issue for the failed ones.

[~rony] Out of around 433, there were 26 accounts that failed due to either missing account number inside the afp filename or missing account type. Is this fine?

Here are a few for each case:
*missing acct number in afp filename:*

The letter 031 does not have any account type set in the program that is why the above error is showing. We need to set the account type in the program though 031 is not listed DL_APP_CODES.xlsx file. Do you know what will be the account type for letter 031? or Should we just set it to "NA"?

Letter 031 should be part of the DL app; let me know if this does not answer your question.

I need to know the account type for letter 031. For example see the below screenshot of index file. The letter 009 has Account Type "LN", Letter 013 has Account Type "SD". Currently for letter 031 no Account Type is set and that is why the index file is giving errors.
