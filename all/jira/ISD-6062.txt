title: 25103 - NECU - Assess delivery preference switch upon unenrollment
description: Testing the following on pilot for enabling this flag on infotrac: unenrollOnDeliveryPreferenceChange

* Only for the user currently being viewed. It's not for all users. Other users shouldn't be unenrolled due to an action for/by another user. --> True
* It is only triggered when the account is the last account on Electronic. If the user has access to other accounts that are still on Electronic, it wouldn't work. --> False, switch to paper will cause user to unenroll even if they have other accts still on E. (Perhaps there's a different flag for bank setups?)
