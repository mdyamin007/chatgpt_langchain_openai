comment: Hi [~jun],

We received feedback on the archival samples.



The start page and total pages column need to have the leasing zeroes added. Also, the index is missing the index account number type.

comment: Hi [~jun]- The Open and Close date fields need to be adjusted. Currently you have them as 12-31-2021. This is incorrect. We need to use the proc date. Please update.

This is what's in the index:

Do I need to switch it to follow the proc date in the insert file used by DP? Or is proc date a different date?

comment: [~jun]- Hi, some feedback...

1. Date of files within zip is still 12/31/21. Please fix.

2. We're using the Account number when we should be using the SSN. SOW has been updated.

3. Where is the backer? This should be included in the PDF.

There's no backer for standard tax archival. Do you have an example of client that has backer?


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~jun]- We need to add the backer to these PDF's. It can be found here -https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-prior/f54982021.pdf.



Please let me know if you have any questions.

comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com],

[~jun]is right, We cannot add backers for standard tax archival application. This is for all standard tax clients. If you cannot explain client, please escalate to [~terrencet].

Thanks,

Which year is this update for? We need to decide which year of the program we need to update to include the backer. Is it for upcoming 2022 or do we need to add it to 2021 too?


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~jun]- this will be for 2021 only. 2022 may have a new backer.
