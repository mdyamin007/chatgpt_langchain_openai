title: FNBK - [29596][pvt][in-house] SBA Customer received another customer's loan bill
description: We were just notified by one of our customers that they received two SBA loan statements in their envelope. One was their statement, but they also received the statement for another customer.

The customer who received the envelope is MEJJM, Inc (301570950). The second (incorrect) statement is for Solomon MD, Inc. (301890499).

I took a look at the file that we sent to you, and the Solomon statement directly follows the bill for MEJJM.

We need to find a different anchor point that is consistent in both versions of the notice. The client has confirmed that once these loans mature, we will receive the version of the notice that contains the "Matured As Of:" verbiage.



Please review and advise what we can anchor to instead of "Bill For"

----------------per client--------------------------

Can you anchor on "Payment Amount", or will the coupon portion screw that up?

----------------per Nischala-------------------------

Yes,"Payment Notice"should work.
