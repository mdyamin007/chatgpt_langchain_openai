title: BKFN - [26481][pvt][in-house] Rate and Payment Notice Inquiry 
description: I have tested format_only.sh with and without the isis_version="717". When running without it, the statement is not showing what's in the data. When running with the newer version it is showing up correctly.



Will need an inhouse JEF to add the isis_version for your team to do a more thorough testing with qa verification before releasing to production.





Sample date: 02/10/2022

approval date: 02/11/2022

Turnover to qa: 02/14/2022

comment: Hi [~rony],

The client is asking for additional samples to review from January files; please let me know if you need me to have those files attached here.



"*We need to get samples for our January 2022 LNM215-Rate/Payment Notices. We have two files that we need sample PDFs created so that we can review them (New Fix/Patch included). (We do not want these notices sent to our customers!)*

*Here are the file dates:*

*BKFN_DL_01152022.zip.pgp  BKFN_lnm215.txt*

*BKFN_DL_01202022.zip.pgp  BKFN_lnm215.txt*

*Please let me know if you want me to resend the files to the TEST directory."*



Thank you,

Keri
