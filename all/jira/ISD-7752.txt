Reference ticket #32893 for issue found tied to email notifications also.

UPDATE: Request ISD to 'purge' any accounts associated to Account Type 'TD' - these are invalid accounts.

IS has completed their release already.

Can you confirm if it would be possible to remove any accounts that had 'TD' as the account type for IVBK? They are all invalid. But what would be the programming involved for this on your end?

Thanks!

comment: [~phoebe.george] we have a purge process that is configurable, I can set it up temporarily for this one-time purge. There are only 4 accts with the TD type so it should be quick to process once I have it setup. I'll update you eod today.

comment: [~phoebe.george] I tested the purge process out on pilot, works as expected. There's no coding/server restart necessary to set this up. Let me know when to purge those 4 accts and I can have it done same day. We can just use this isd story to track. Thanks!

comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] Thank you, that is the best news I've heard all day. You can update in production any time you are ready. I'll add this to the ISD description also on this story.

comment: [~phoebe.george] Great, I finished purging those 4 accounts on production. I checked the database too and there are no longer any accts with the TD type.
