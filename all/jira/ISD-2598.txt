I have fixed date-picker issue in batchdownload by adding some js file related to datepicker and datatable. Code is in trunk now.

Thanks.

 # For the Download Button, it should either open in a new window or trigger a download on the browser instead of changing the current tab to the download link.
 # When I try to download, I get a null pointer error.

Thanks,

comment: Hi [~tai.trinh],
 The reason for the null pointer error is "Content-Disposition" is not set in the API response header. If the value of "Content-Disposition" is set in the header then the download will be started after clicking the download button.

As far as I know cid.passphrase needs to be set in swift settings of infoservice's app-config for any client who wants to use batch download. I have checked pilot config and it seems to be missing. Normally all the clients' config is CID.passphrase=changeme. I'm not sure what value to put instead of changeme or it should be changeme for IDCU as well, that's why I didn't add the config. Can you talk to Surekha about this?

The path for swift settings is:/usr/local/tomcat/app-configs/infoservice/config.properties

Thanks.

The statement type selection doesn't actually work. It always return all of the statements. Can you take a look into why this is the case?

Thanks,

I have fixed the statement type selection issue. But unfortunately, we could not test it because from our side we were not getting any content from searchDocuments API call of pilot infoservice. Sometimes we face this kind of issue for pd-pilot1 infoservice from our side. So we consulted with Joe about this and deployed code in pilot. We are still facing that API issue. So we decided to test it on Monday. If it is urgent can you please test it from your side and let me know if it is working or not?

Thanks,
