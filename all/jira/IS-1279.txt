comment: Hi[~billr] [~Kbittmann],

In the sample please ignore the message manager image.

For generating sample we used the data cycle 0531.

I couldn't find any cycle for June in production. That's why I had to use cycle 0531 and had to edit the statement end date in data so that the statement consider it as a June statement and produce inline insert.

The 0531 cycle is so big. That's why I have chosen randomly 15 customers from cycle 0531 to generate sample.

Please review the sample and provide it to CU today so that we can proceed to early release.

Thanks

Based on the client,  >>>> *The inserts were intended to come after the disclosures - not before."
Are we planning to fix it or we will keep it as is for now? *

In case you planning to keep it as is, Please request the print samples


author: mahbubs
comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid],

To avoid last minute code update hassle, it would be safe to keep the current way of printing disclosure.

I requested to [~Kbittmann]in ts if the samples are approved.

Meanwhile you can consider the following sample as approved sample.[^ufcums11278.pdf]

Thanks

comment: [~Kbittmann]/[~Jessica]: Can you respond to Sakib? He's asked question and is pending responses. With EOM coming up this week, we don't want any issues. If samples are not approved in time, I think we may halt to next EOM to go live. Based on seeing TS# 29542 comment #56, sounds like it would be ok if we cannot make it this month.
