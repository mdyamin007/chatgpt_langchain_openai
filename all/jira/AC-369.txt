title: GDCU - [24829][pvt][in-house]TAX 2021 Update
description: The mapping in GDCUMS11.dfa for taxes need to be updated.



IRS changed data record layout this year (Add additional amount fields and shifted recipient address and other information after those extra account fields). I think GDCU tax is still formatted in monthly statement format program (as combined setup). If so, we will need to update field positions according to IRS record layout.
