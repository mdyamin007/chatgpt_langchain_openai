"PC database didn't return insert bin entries where jobid=999999-C31.01-V99999." due to infotrac begin turned on, turn it off will resolve the error.

"ran into is development folder not found" error from running the rht check-in script. I already sent an email to peter requesting for help, currently waiting for peter's response.

comment: wilson: 8/22/2022 3:00pm - 6:01pm debugging validate table error
It turns out it's a syntax error caused by using _split() and match2 function from 772. These functions are not available in versions below 7.31.


author: terrence.tong
comment: wilson 9:am - 11:42am
Investigate why 741 is not usable in rht even though it exists. 
turns out /home/master/isis_version.sh sets the path to isiscomm_6741 instead of isiscomm_741. The only solution is to convert DFA to use functions that are available in 7.17.



author: terrence.tong
comment: wilson: 12pm to 1:13pm
rewriting DFA to remove match2() and _split().


author: terrence.tong
comment: wilson: 1:13 to 2:42
finish rewriting DFA and ran the process file. 
Currently working on verifying the result generated by the process file is correct.

Note: 7.13 supports match2 function but not _split() function. The documentation in 7.17 does not include match2, it only appears in versions after 7.31. It's unknown why this function works in 7.13.

trying to figure out why rht is missing the fonts needed to process afp.


author: terrence.tong
comment: wilson:
9am - 2pm fixing font error and continue testing processing script(print option)
2pm - 4pm setting up archive option and testing archive option.



author: terrence.tong
comment: 1 hour IS training with peter 


author: terrence.tong
comment: 8 hours of setting and testing archival.

Note: /x is not mapped in preprocessing03 so the old script doesn't work on rht. Currently, the script is running afp2pdf on rht, instead of ssh into rh2. This is may change once Terrence clarifies with William. 


author: terrence.tong
comment: 9am - 2pm debugging. Error: preproc1 and preproc3 return a license not supported error when doing true type font archival conversion. 
2pm - 3pm qa/is training


author: terrence.tong
comment: 1-hour debugging with Terrence on why overloading the afp2web.ini won't convert pdf to True type font.


author: terrence.tong
comment: 9am to 10am debugging the font error. Turns out the error occurred because the font doesn't exist in the extfont folder. This error requires Ernest to map the fonts for non-existing fonts.


author: terrence.tong
comment: 1 hour making sure Ernest and William enable the true type font.

Sounds like the story is not ready for testing
1. Access to the mapping - not provided. IN addition my understanding mapping should be located in SharePoint. Please provided access or the link to the SharePoint
2. Unable to start papyrus output - getting and error. See attached >>>>  !papyrus output error.png|thumbnail!

Based on all that - the story status reverting to "In-Progress"

comment: [~Igor.Khosid] I just updated the zip file in the QA folder again. 


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~Ricky Lopez] [~OIR] (Wilson) - please do not switch to QA request until all the pieces are added for QA to begin.
 # Al needs to update the SOW with the nautilus PDF specs ([~albertM])
 # DPVS print samples are printed and scanned.
 # [~albertM] Please provide mapping for Sharepoint link

[~Igor.Khosid] FYI - the SOW link was added based on modifications made by IM, but BA still needs to finish their updates.



We'll assign to QA once these items are completed as discussed.



Thanks,

comment: [~Igor.Khosid] heavy, print suppression, and new_print are ready for review. Thank you! 


author: JIRAUSER11700
comment: [~albertM]mapping file says that the header data to the right from the logo should be printed in Arial if I understand correctly; yet in samples, it is in Courier / monospace. Was there a change in the client's wishes?

author: JIRAUSER11700
comment: [~OIR]when I look at heavy doc pages, it catches my eye that we leave one third of every page empty:

!hvy doc page sample.png!

Is that intentional?


author: JIRAUSER11700
comment: [~OIR]- please disregard my previous comment: I see the reason for this page formatting now.


author: terrence.tong
comment: [~avannik] You can @oir department at IS-1406 next time and I will be able to see it. I can make some changes to the logo and the information next to it but the logo and the header next to it will be very small
[~albertM] do you know if the client is ok with shrinking the logo and the information header?

comment: [~OIR]

Finished checking mapping; there are a few minor issues I put to bug list.


author: terrence.tong
comment: [~avannik] sounds good, Al is currently waiting for a reply from COLU about the font. I'll continue work on getting the logo and return address sorted out.


author: terrence.tong
comment: [~avannik] I finished fixing all bugs, please review fixed_sample1.pdf for the newest update. Thank you!

Please request print samples.

[~OIR]could you please include one heavy in the range?

Thanks


author: terrence.tong
comment: [~avannik] I haven't run the parallel test yet, can you check if the return address aligns properly? I can provide you with the heavy once I know this DFA works. Thanks!


author: JIRAUSER11700
comment: [~OIR], thanks, the address is fine:

[~Ricky Lopez]please confirm that the client is OK with their nice logo being part hidden in tap left, and we close that issue.

comment: [~Igor.Khosid] Please review [^columl1_process - Copy.sh] 
Parallel id: 20220926155014

changes:
1. added logic to remove datatrack.tmp file before processing datafile.

if [ -e "${home_env}/${keep_dir}/${cid}${jid}.datatrack.tmp" ]; then
    echo "removing ${home_env}/${keep_dir}/${cid}${jid}.datatrack.tmp ........." 
    rm -f "${home_env}/${keep_dir}/${cid}${jid}.datatrack.tmp"
fi

testing in parallel environment:
1. create a file in /home/test/keep/columl1.datatrack.tmp
2. run the script and verify that the file is deleted in /home/test/keep/

comment: I can confirm that the script modification does exactly what is described above: it deletes datatrack tmp file for locu ml1 app.

I have no information regarding the effect of that action. Looks like it removes older jobs from the list. I hope it does not disrupt anything, like, multi-segment jobs.

[~phoebe.george] [~Ricky Lopez]if you can please confirm if that was what we wanted to do, we may move on with this task.

comment: [~avannik] - there was an internal issue reported where InfoTrac was capturing a lot of file names in Job Status. This update is to correct this issue, as we only receive 1 file per day for COLU:
