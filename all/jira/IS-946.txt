I don't see any isd story for this so don't know who to provide the index file. The index file name is ms1_20201201_1_20220323_1353_eqbk.txt.

Please ask isd to process in the stage.

Btw for some entries in client csv index file account type is empty. We are ignoring these records. There are total 14 such entries found.

isd index:ms1_20201201_1_20220407_1025_eqbk.txt for the pilot. It takes much time to process, so I didn't process it for stage yet. The index file was generated from/z/download/eqbk/preingestion/eqbk_stmt_preingestion_1220.zip.



Thanks

comment: [~berezinez] I believe the customer provides the index file for these. These are posted to pilot as the client and I do not have access to staging.

I ran for staging a few hours ago. The index file for staging is ms1_20201201_1_20220412_1256_eqbk.txt.

[~Shun.Kuwashima]was the person from ISD who was involved here. You can go to the epic link and see who is the assignee for is-story as well as ISD.
