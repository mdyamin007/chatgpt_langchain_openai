comment: of course they tell me something different today.

# would we be able to sort such that anum0 is last in the list so anum1 is the landing account number.
# Do we have logic to include banner verbiage 
## because they do no' understand the account number is drop down and want to have this be pointed out.
## target per account to display something?

comment: Shahadet,

# tai updated the code to do a sort based on the numerical value instead of a string. does any other logic use this sorting based on strings?

2.  can we get an estimate on the banner below the ----- navigation line.

we just need a banner.verbiage variable to print if present where the client can put a message to the user outside the important information which apparently would be even more important information.

ignore the 2b question. we arent going to try this.

comment: Hi Michael,

Could you please give me the verbiage that i have to show in your indicated place. i am working on it. it will take 10-12 hours to complete. We have to show it based on selected account as i understood. right?

comment: Hi Dipak,

It should always be present when the eStatements page is selected. We can remove the Important Information wording, just the title, on the right, so we wont have two important information sections.



{quote}*Important Information:*

If a list of your eStatements is not appearing below, please click the box to the right that currently shows your member number and the words Tax Documents. When you click, you will get a dropdown menu. From there you can choose between your different statements accounts.

comment: Hi Tai,

 the verbiage will be client specific? if it is then we will read it from client specific properties file unless in common place.

comment: verbiage is added based on client specific and code is checked in. you can have a look.

comment: Is there a way to format part of the verbiage, such as bold? I tried <span style=\\font-weight: bold\\> Important Information: </span>the_rest_of_the_verbiage. But it seems like any html is just printed verbatim.  I will update the client, regardless, but I have a feeling they may want specifically a bolded Important Information wording.

comment: To be able to do formatting on the text would be ideal I think. However, specifically for SEFC. This is what they want. The *Important Information* doesnt need to be its own section as shown below. It could just be 

*Important Information*: If a list of your eStatements

That is what I attempted with 

<span style=\\font-weight: bold\\> Important Information: </span> If a list of your eStatements...

but did not succeed.

Is it possible to have to the bannerVerbiage be a flag of \[true/false] instead and then make the banner area pulls from an html file, similar to how the section below the statement display pulls from disclosure-default.html?
