title: 19311 - GECU - Estatement Enrollment Issue on Android
description: *Per client:*

We are seeing a "Sorry...technical difficulties" error for an Enrolled-then-unenrolled user in Android under the Business Banking Statements SSO. The error is *only occurring in Android, not iPhone.*

This is about the enrolled-then-unenrolled user seeing an error in Android under Statements SSO.

At 2:13pmEST on 3/30, Enrolled-then-unenrolled-in-statements User ID Damian**** sees "Sorry...technical difficulties" error in Android.
 At 2:19pmEST on 3/30, Enrolled-then-unenrolled-in-statements User ID Damian**** sees expected enrollment page in iOS.
 " I unenrolled from eStatements and now I am being prompted with an error instead of the registration screen on the Android. iPhone prompted the correct registration process."



*Also from GECU:*

I see from the page layout, that the site is attempting to display a PDF inline in the page. Looks like they are attempting to use their own PDF renderer. Interesting, have not seen anyone try that before.

The vendor needs to debug the code on their site / figure out why the error page is coming up, which is caused by the following error that is detected by the Android WebView:

net::ERR_FAILED on url [https://estmts.gecu-ep.org/enroll/dummystatement.pdf]

The net::ERR_FAILED can come from a resource not found error: /favicon.ico:1 Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)

Chrome debugger is showing the following in the console:

pdf.js:6211 The provided value 'moz-chunked-arraybuffer' is not a valid enum value of type XMLHttpRequestResponseType.
 supportsMozChunkedClosure @ pdf.js:6211



Client uses this type of webview:android.webkit.WebView
