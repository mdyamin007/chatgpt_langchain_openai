title: FNBK - [29909][pvt][in-house] Update to Tax Cross Reference File Processing
description: Need to update the script - fnbk_spec_handle.pl. Currently, the script prompts the user to enter the filename with path for both the cross reference files. We can either validate the file naming convention after user entry or we can update the script to search for files based on the file name patterns in the directory.

I updated the script for "fnbk_spec_handle.pl" to set restriction from user to enter a wrong filename pattern for cross reference files. To demonstrate, I processed the program three time with one of the successful case and two failed case. I attached the samples below.

*Here is files generated from the successful run:*
DVPS:  [^fnbk8sa131.print] 
log file:  [^today.log]

*Here are the captures for the failed cases when the user enter wrong filename pattern for xref files:
*
case 1: (incorrect pattern for the first input)

case 2: (correct pattern for first input, incorrect for the second one)
