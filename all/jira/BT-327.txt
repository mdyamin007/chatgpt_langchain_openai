comment: [~gthillaivel] [~phoebe.george] ISD retrieves the dtjobid from the IS database. If it's showing null, that most likely means it's not in the IS database either. PC needs to create the dtjobid and the job needs to be created using that dtjobid, which I believe is on the IS side? Please check with PC/IS.

comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] Thanks! [~gthillaivel] I'll request from PC and ask IS to update.

Please update the DT JOB ID as soon as you are able to so we can complete QA.

comment: [~tohidulI] We're still not seeing the dtjobid, can you check if you need to enable any estatement tracking flags? I believe these need to be enabled on PC and/or IS side, please check.

comment: [~rony] Can you check this as well?
