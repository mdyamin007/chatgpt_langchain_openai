Please provide by how much does the logo need to be moved upward? It's current position in the dfa has a vertical value of .2

I shifted the logo to the left by .08, but since I was able to tell where the start of the second window was compared to the bottom of the "ColumbiaCU.org" line was, I moved it up by .2

The screenshots you just provided are from the old afp or old samples because the 2D prefix didn't change.

 As noted earlier, these samples are the same and from all your screenshots, the 2D prefix is bmi so these aren't the latest sample. The 2D prefix on the new afp is c7u as seen in the attached DPVS and the old one was bmi.

Please confirm that the print sample request was using the new DPVS and afp
