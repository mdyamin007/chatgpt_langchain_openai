Do we have a sample file from the client yet?

The file is incorrect. I think they followed the wrong specs. These are the required specs:CIF|Member Number|Member Name|Delivery Preference

comment: [~mac] thanks for the update, I have requested a new file.

comment: [~mac] OSCU is testing the latest file in pilot site.

They provided the following feedback - can you confirm (they are providing feedback in TS #22386 if you want to reference:

The accounts I have reviewed all say Paper enrollment, when I search via Account Management Tab, i see the statement delivery change but should we not see this in the account history?

[~kericapote] FYI based on Kim's update in ticket #22386 for the programming update we're working on.

comment: [~mac] can you confirm why the history on the InfoTrac paperless display does not show the correct last modified date? Here are a few examples from the last file revert list:

Account #335818

comment: [~phoebe.george]For your previous two comments, the accounts listed in them are not in any of the two index files I have processed. The two index files I have processed are:OSCU__09222021_1200_closedaccount (before) andOSCU_09282021_1500_closedaccount (latest) on pilot.

Also, if the delivery preference is already on 'Paper' then the modified date won't change because it is already on 'Paper', so there isn't anything to update.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~mac] that makes sense, thanks for the update! I have informed the CU accordingly and will confirm once the pilot site is approved. Thanks!


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~mac] here is the new file - can you have this loaded to pilot as well? Thanks!

comment: The new file has been loaded on pilot.

comment: [~mac] OSCU reported a discrepancy on the pilot site, and we found that there are two instance of account #220414.

The revert to paper file had this account present, but it contains leading zeros. So the pilot site contains separate profiles for #220414 and #0000220414.

0000220414 with leading zeros shows the correct update to revert back to paper on 10/12 when you ran the new list yesterday.

Should the CU always REMOVE any leading zeros before sending this file? I just want to confirm if the production system expects leading zeros or not, and they can update the Revert to Paper list accordingly. Thanks!


author: JIRAUSER10913
comment: [~phoebe.george]Accounts with and without leading zeros are two different accounts on pilot. Although most accounts on production don't have leading zeros, there are some that have leading zeros, but there are no statements posted for them.

If we are expecting accounts to not have leading zeros, then we will need the CU to remove the zeros from the file.
