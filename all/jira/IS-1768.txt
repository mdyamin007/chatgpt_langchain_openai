Hi Pam, one question currently 90 is selected in penalties section forCERTDISCLOSURE ,but in doc Certificate Disclosure - normal (Clean).docx 180 is selected. Do we need to change this since client didn't highlighted this in yellow.

*Client answer* per comment 18, ticket #34533: "There is no change to the penalty boxes. Which box is checked depends on the term of the certificate. We send this information to you in the file with the tag frequency to indicate which box to check. If frequency=1 then it indicates to mark the 90, if frequency=2 then it indicates to mark the 180."

comment: Thank you [~rumanb]and [~Andrey.Kutsenko]. Samples provided to client and note about correcting the file.


author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~rumanb]and [~Andrey.Kutsenko], MFCU provided an updated file.

[^Certificate Disclosure - bump (Clean)-1.docx]

Thanks


author: dyuen
comment: HI [~rumanb], MFCU has some edits they would like to make to the letters. Please see the following.

Per MFCU:

"Hi Daphne,

On the flex disclosure in the fine print it looks like the words after the comma were dropped off in the first sentence (unless a bump option is available and exercised."). That is the only thing we found missing from the original changes we requested.

Would making any of the following changes impact our estimate and/or timeline if we requested that these be completed as well?

The team requested the following edits as follows:
 * The ACH hold language was un-bolded and moved to the last sentence of the paragraph.
 * The first few sentences of the penalty section were updated to make the penalty info clearer.

I am attaching updated disclosures for your review.

[^Certificate Disclosure - bump (Clean)_11082022.docx]

[^Certificate Disclosure - normal (Clean)_11082022.docx]

[^Certificate Disclosure - flex (Clean)_11082022.docx]

Thanks.

Here is the updated samples [^mfcudl002.pdf] [^MFCUDL003.pdf][^mfcudl004.pdf]
 The samples are also available in : */d/ac-secure-share/ac/daphne/IS-1768/*

Can you please review them and let me know if the verbiages are same as docs that client provided ?

Thanks!


author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~rumanb], they look good. Forwarded to MFCU for review.

Thanks


author: dyuen
comment: HI [~rumanb], looks like there is some verbiage missing. Please see response from MFCU

"...Before I send these to the team for final approval, the flex is still missing some verbiage in the fine print section. It is missing ", unless a bump option is available and exercised." from the first sentence. All three disclosures should have the same fine print. Can you provide new samples for just the flex and I will send them all to the team at once?"

Can you update and provide a new sample?

Thanks

comment: Hi [~dyuen]

comment: Hi [~rumanb], samples looked up. Forwarded updated 003 to client. Pending approval.

Thanks!


author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~rumanb], samples are approved.

Per MFCU: "All revised samples have been approved. Our project live date is still pending due to internal programming on our end but we would like to go forward with getting these letters moved live. Can we get these moved into production at your earliest convenience?"

[~Andrey.Kutsenko], please confirm if you need print samples since description states no parallel.

Thanks

comment: Hi [~rumanb] 
Please change dfa file (BT-564) based on the Client's answer per comment 18, ticket #34533:
 "There is no change to the penalty boxes.  Which box is checked depends on the term of the certificate.  We send this information to you in the file with the tag frequency to indicate which box to check.  If frequency=1 then it indicates to mark the 90, if frequency=2 then it indicates to mark the 180."

comment: Hi [~Andrey.Kutsenko]

Same logic is applicable for 3 letters 002, 003, 004 , right ?

 I fixed this issue in 3 letters and kept the updated dfa's in parallel and also restored projects *MFCUDL002.zip**MFCUDL003.zip**MFCUDL004.zip* in QA folder (*/d/iss/qa/MFCU*).


Can you please check it again and let me know if the issue is resolved or not ?

Thanks!


author: JIRAUSER11104
comment: Thanks, [~rumanb]

Checked projects in Papyrus. All forms looks good.

comment: [~rumanb], do we need to upload any resources for ISD?

comment: Hi [~Andrey.Kutsenko]

*DPVS*         : [^mfcudla116.print]
 +*ISD Index File  :*+ [^dla_20221116_1_20221116_0134_mfcu.txt]
 +*index file path  :*+/t/isd_input_dev/I3/process-files/mfcu/dla_20221116_1_20221116_0134_mfcu.txt

*N. B :* We don't need any resources to upload in ISD site as I didn't add any extra pseg/Tiff for this update.

For Simple verbiage update Can we bypass DPVS, Index file in future ?

Thanks!
