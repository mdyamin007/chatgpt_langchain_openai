It looks like Tye did not fully upload the resources onto our ISD servers, so I took care of that just now. I also created an index file based off of nischala's but with only a few accounts because the pdfs are only attached via email and not visible on the sites, and so I had to trigger emails to myself in order to receive the statements.

I attached [^mmef_999001.pdf] to this ticket as a sample to verify that the resources show. Usually it's password encrypted but since I downloaded it after entering the password, I think you can just view the pdf normally. If you do receive a password prompt, then please enter in 999001 as the password.  Let me know if there are any issues viewing the pdf.
