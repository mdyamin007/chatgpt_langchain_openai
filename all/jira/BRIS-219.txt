title: Brisbane InfoTRAC & PUI URL, IP & Port Request
description: [~davidt]: Would you be able to have someone provide the details below so that i can have Network give me port access to access the following web application. At least I hope to get Prod & Stage first. I tried digging it up on the Brisbane Server list but I either wasn't sure or could not find information on:


|*URL*|*Brisbane Server IP*|*Port*|
|https://infotrac.infoimageinc.com/login.do||443|
|http://pui-prod.infoimageinc.com/login.jsp|ca-pui-pr-01 (10.4.16.66)|80|
|infotrac_stage URL??||443|
|http://pui-stage.infoimageinc.com/login.jsp|ca-pui-st-01 (10.5.16.189)|80|
|infotrac_pilot URL??||443|
|http://pui-pilot.infoimageinc.com/login.jsp|ca-pui-pi-01 (10.5.16.188)|80|
|infotrac_dev URL??||443|
|http://pui-dev.infoimageinc.com/login.jsp|ca-pui-dv-01 (10.5.16.199)|80|

comment: Anil,

Can you help update the Prod related item that William is requesting. Forward to Sean for PUI if you need him to take care of them. Once we get the Stage and Pilot, we will fill the rest

Thanks

David

comment: [~anil.dasa]: Did David speak with you on Friday in regards to the infotrac URL? For Network to give us access, I thought we are using port 443 (SSL) and not port 8380. So which brisbane server/proxy should i be using to connect to column 1 above (e.g. [https://infotrac.infoimageinc.com/login.do).]



When i give my team the URL to use on the IS JumpStation, I will be givening them column 1 above. If that is not available, then I will+temporarily+ ask Network to use column two instead.



[~kent.chan] and [~davidt]: FYI.
