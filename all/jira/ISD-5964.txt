comment: [~mac] [~tai.trinh] TKCU would like us to re-direct to the below URL when the Exit button is clicked: [https://secure.tinkerfcu.org/]



Please confirm this can be done and deployed to the pilot site (and confirm timing as well) - reference requested update in TS #25531.

comment: [~mac] [~Tin.Chak] TKCU would like to have one more update (based on TS#25531):

When member clicks the exit button, direct the member back to[https://secure.tinkerfcu.org/]

TKCU confirmed that the Banno SSO will not be iFrame (reference ticket).

Please confirm as soon as you are able to for ETA to deploy this update to pilot site for TKCU to complete testing.

Thanks,

Phoebe

This wasn't quoted as part of the original project.

If possible, please bill the client for 1 additional hour to make the update.

Mac will make the update asap.

Thanks,
Tai

comment: [~Tin.Chak] [~mac] Please confirm this questions from TKCU on this project:



Is the list below still accurate for system requirements for eStatements?

*System Requirements*
 * To use free eStatements, eNotices and Check Images, you must use one of the two most recent versions of the following Internet browsers: Firefox, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Apple Safari or Opera. Older versions of these browsers are not recommended, as they may not be as secure and can cause functionality issues.
 * You must have 256-bit encryption, Adobe Readerand an email address.

comment: [~phoebe.george] The system requirement is the standard eStatement one. I don't think we're supporting Opera anymore. For the 256-bit encryption, are they talking about SSL? That should be up to the browser, and updated browser should support it already. The other specs are correct.
