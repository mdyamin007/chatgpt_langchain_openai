The mapping is currently pointing to the Late Charges in the 4000 record Column 110 but should be the Potential Late Charge in 4000 record Column 675.







This variable {CUR_GRP!'_CUR_ACCOUNT_OTHER_CHARGES'} extracted from record 4000 column 110 in ACCT_LOAN_ACCOUNT_SUMMARY_001_OSI_DNA_VA external docformat. Don't change in the external docformat , but after calling the docformat , manually assign this variable again with correct column as client expected.



Do not change here:





Assign the variable here again below the docformat call:

Per client:

The file has been reviewed. From the sample provided, there was only one LOC example on the statements but it did not have a balance or late fee to validate.

How would you recommend getting a sample that has more applicable accts to display and validate this change ? There was a displayed verbiage change to show "POTENTIAL" late fee.

Can you please ask the client for an account list that contains those Potential late fees sections So that i can extract those accounts from September End of month data file and provide samples

Thanks
