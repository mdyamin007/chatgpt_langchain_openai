title: WFCU - [21973][pvt] Unify CU E-Statements URL Name Change
description: For this change, we will need a new certificate, and you will need to make changes on the DNS side. The current estatement DNS record is an A record. This will need to be changed to a CNAME. estatements.unifyfcu.com ->CNAME->wfcuprod.infoimageinc.com



Additionally your Online Banking vendor will need to point to the new domain as well, so we will need to coordinate this change.



------------------------per Kent----------------------------------

the new CNAME does not need to be coordinated as it would point to the new URL which would be a seperate site from the current. We technically can have both old and new sites up in parallel, the only time there would need to be a switchover is when the SSO would need to point to the new site, which we shouldn't need to do anything for.

comment: Hi [~kdishroon], is there a set time yet for when this coordinated change is going to take place?


author: kdishroon
comment: Hi [~Shun.Kuwashima] - Originally it was supposed to be end of this week but I will update you tomorrow. Network had some additional questions for the client today.


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: Hi [~kdishroon], any update on this? Can we at least push out the live date since the current one is already past due?


author: kdishroon
comment: Hi [~Shun.Kuwashima] - We are pending client response, I have moved the live date but will probably need to revise again once I hear back from the client.

comment: Thanks [~kdishroon]

comment: Hi [~kdishroon], I noticed that the 'from address' in the enotice email template on InfoTRAC still has the old email Unify@UnifyFCU.com. Can you remind the client to update this to the new email? Also if we can revise the live date again, that would be great. Thanks!

comment: [~kdishroon] is there any update from the client on this? If not can we update the live date? Also another reminder that their enotice email template on InfoTRAC is still showing the old 'from' address Unify@UnifyFCU.com, so the client needs to remember to update this.

Sorry for the delay, I finally just receive an update from the client, can you answer her question:

"apologies.. they are working on the SSL cert first. the CNAME change we will need to wait until Q2 is ready as well. What are next steps when the SSL is done to prep for the DNA change and go live between us, InfoImage, and Q2?"

comment: [~kdishroon] Thanks for updating the dates. As for the client's question, I think you need to check with Networks. We should not need to do anything on ISD's end. As mentioned before I think the client still needs to update the 'From Email' address in their enotice email template on Infotrac to eStatements@UnifyFCU.com


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: Hi [~kdishroon], I believe we're still waiting on Q2 per TS 21973. Can we update the due date once more? It's been sitting for a few months now, so I was also curious if we could move this to Hold if they need more time.

comment: [~kdishroon] Per 21973 it sounds like their production testing was successful, therefore I'll close out this story since there is no updates to make on ISD's end. 

Also as I mentioned before, the client may need to update the From Email address in their enotice template on InfoTRAC, it is still showing the old email Unify@UnifyFCU.com.
