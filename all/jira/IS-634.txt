Please attach the mapping here. And also update the sow if not updated already. We couldn't check the sow today for some technical issue.

Thanks

[~Kbittmann]: Please add letter 29 to the Daily Notice SOW.

The scope of work in this project was documented in comment #1 in TS# 23803 was to explicitly address 'Adverse_Action_ConsumerCentral_11012021.csv ' data file. Please focus on work on this file only. In the test file, there are other data files included we don't need to worry about them:



Date Time Attr Size Compressed Name
------------------- ----- ------------ ------------ ------------------------
2021-11-02 03:12:21 ....A 269415 25598 Adverse_Action_11012021.csv

I believe client may just want us to provide samples including the other files that are existing applications.



*KRIS*: Please follow-up with IDCU to confirm if my assessment is correct.

That is correct.


author: mahbubs
comment: Hi [~William.Kong] [~Kbittmann],

According to current workload, It will be too hard to provide 1st sample of this project on 15 dec.

Or if we have to provide sample anyway on 15 dec the QA will not be completed.

I request to extend the 1st sample date to 17 or 20 dec if possible.

Please let me know ASAP.

Thanks


author: william.kong
comment: [~Kbittmann]: Can we adjust it to 12/20 instead? Please advise. If so, I will adjust the dates in this story accordingly.


author: mahbubs
comment: Hi [~Kbittmann],

What would be the Letter name for this new Letter?

For example, these are the previous Adverse letter names.

Once client is ready to resume, we will see if any redo coding work is needed and if resourcing is available to resume any left over coding that is needed.

 # Tap test  The letter inside the envelope moved all the way down and left.
 _As result. The address is not visible through the upper window in the envelope._
 _The Logo needs to be moved up about  inch._
 # Tap test - The letter inside the envelope moved all the way up and left.

author: mahbubs
comment: Hi [~Andrey.Kutsenko],

I used the logo position like it is in other letters (in production) of IDCU.

If this tap test issue is applicable for this letter then all the letters in production should have issue!

As long as client don't have any objection with production letters then this tap test issue for this letter can be ignored.

Thanks


author: igor.khosid
comment: [~mahbubS] [~Andrey.Kutsenko]
Sakib, I'll discuss it today on the scrum meeting


author: igor.khosid
comment: [~mahbubS] [~TunA]
Could you please update the logo position just for this notice (029) right now? We will evaluate it and will update all of them if needed. 


author: mahbubs
comment: Hi [~TunA]and [~Igor.Khosid],

Andrey suggested to move it inch up (0.25 inch up).

The image is already being printed in 0.2 inch from top of the page. See below snap:

!image-2022-02-16-15-06-01-717.png!



So, now we have to place the logo at 0 inch from top.

If we place the logo at 0 inch, then it will look like below:

!image-2022-02-16-15-18-46-300.png!



I attached a sample in this mail.[^idcudl029_local.pdf]

This sample is locally generated just for your review regarding the logo position.

If this placement looks ok then please confirm, then i will update the dfa program.

Thanks


author: igor.khosid
comment: [~mahbubS] [~Andrey.Kutsenko] [~Kbittmann] [~TunA]

Thank you, Sakib
1. Yes, you are correct; moving the logo 1/4" up will cut off the top portion of the logo.
2. I have moved the logo position up 1/8"  - see attached samples and looks much better, but wondering if moving the logo 3/16" would be better. >>>>  [^IS-634_IDCU_LTR_029_02162022.pdf] 
>>>
Sakib, as discussed this morning, please move the logo about 3/16" up, provide the new dpvs, and we will check if it is positioning correctly

Kris, please request the print samples (in CA) as soon as dpvs will be provided


author: mahbubs
comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid],

I moved the logo vertically up by 3/16 inch.

Ran the updated dfa program in parallel today.

It was sent to the test folder in the FTP.

Thanks


author: mahbubs
comment: Hi [~dyuen],

The 7z file (IDCU_DL_030322.7z) must have the lookup file inside it. See red marked below for naming convention.

!image-2022-03-04-23-08-50-377.png!

Also please make sure the/home/test/keep/checklist/idcudla_checklist.txt file have the below line in it:

!image-2022-03-04-23-14-18-691.png!

This file may get updated by the production one. I don't know why this happens, but please request someone when this task goes to product this line must contain in/home/keep/checklist/idcudla_checklist.txt file.

Thanks

comment: 

Hi [~dyuen]: Sakib is right. IDCU_DL_030322.7z must have IDCU_PERM(MMDDYY>.txt in order to process. Please request client to resend the test data file.



Hi [~mahbubS]: For/home/test/keep/checklist/idcudla_checklist.txt and/home/keep/checklist/idcudla_checklist.txt, can you please take care of those. Daphne cannot update those.
