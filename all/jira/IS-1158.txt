Client has recently sent us an update about the following:

We would like the notice to say this: Re: Individual Retirement Account (IRA) instead of this
 
removing the #xxxxxx# portion.


Please let us know if any questions

Thank you!

Per the email at 1:49PM, samples were provided by Colton and have been approved so I assume the update has already been made.

The script has been updated with the new letter 125 information.


author: JIRAUSER11300
comment: Thank you, [~Natalie.Tom], the samples have been approved
Do you have  timing on the script portion of the setup for testing?

What do you mean by timing? Per my last comment "The script has been updated with the new letter 125 information."

[~Igor.Khosid]I'm providing the parallel ID for QA to check when ready

Please assign this story to QA.



There is no dfa in PR_ID, please reexport.

 # There is no dfa in PR_ID, please add and export the project to QA folder.
 # please provide an Index file if there is an eside.

[~phoebe.george]
 # please request print samples.
 # Is this notice has a paper side only? or it has eside and pdf archival?




author: phoebe.george
comment: [~Natalie.Tom] Due to the timeframe, please confirm if you have flagged this notice for print only, or if it is flagged as eNotice also. I will need to submit a post-update to setup for electronic posting due to the timeframe.

Also, are you able to provide a DPVS for print samples so we can request ASAP?

Thanks!


author: JIRAUSER11300
comment: Hi [~berezinez], please find attached samples per [~phoebe.george]'s request

Please let us know if any questions

Thank you!

comment: [~phoebe.george] 
The dfa should handle whether or not enotices are flagged so that would've been handled by Colton. Looking at the dfa, I don't think it's setup for enotices.

I have to manually create the zip.pgp file to process, I will provide the DPVS ASAP

Sorry, I wanted to clarify that initially looking at the dfa, it didn't seem to have enotices. Please check with Colton.


author: terrence.tong
comment: Please wait on processing this. Currently looking into a bug within the dfa. 


author: terrence.tong
comment: [~Natalie.Tom] 

The logic for enotice isn't coming from the dfa, it is coming from the processing shell. Isisdisk_daily s for print and f for enotice.

comment: [~phoebe.george] [~Natalie.Tom]

On the mapping doc appears IRA account number but I don't have it on the approved samples and output, should it be there?

!IRA acount on mapping but not on approved samples..GIF!


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~berezinez] Sorry, this was not updated on the template doc, but during sample review, SSCU requested it to be removed - here is the emailed request:

Hey Phoebe,



Can we get the following section updated? Since we are not populating the IRA account number.



We would like the notice to say this: Re: Individual Retirement Account (IRA) instead of this



removing the #xxxxxx# portion.



Thanks,

After the format step the txt has already has z for esupression so they'll all go to enotice. Also the address seems to be in the wrong spot and it might cause issues with the 2D.

comment: # I fixed the address precision. 
# Natalie stated that 'After the format step the txt has already has z for esupression so they'll all go to enotice.', which is not true. They will not all go to enotice. When it finds a match in the cross reference file (/home/test/keep/sscu/sscu_xfer.dat) it will pull the member number, otherwise, it will suppress the e statement.

The endorsement is missing on the print samples, please fix it and request a new set of samples.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~berezinez] [~Natalie.Tom] There is no endorsement line printing for the daily notice applications, it is okay. I updated the SOW, it was missed during original setup. Thank you!

Should we post all accounts for this notice? Currently some notices are using xref file for enotice suppression and "DO NOT MAIL" accounts.


author: william.kong
comment: [~phoebe.george]: I know you are OOO today, but this job is still in parallel and not sure if it+must+ go live today.

[~andreav]: Do you know the status if we must go live today since it is still in Parallel? If it must go live today, someone need to expediate this with OPS.








author: JIRAUSER11300
comment: Hi [~William.Kong], [~andreav], yes, this must go live today.
[~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] has reached DP and PC for the parallel progress


author: william.kong
comment: Thanks [~Juliana Vannik]for the update! Hope you and [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]can make sure OPS finishes the parallel today on time. If not, you guys will need to inform PC to put production "On Hold" tomorrow if the new data file arrives tomorrow.

[~Natalie.Tom]: FYI.


author: JIRAUSER11300
comment: Thank you [~William.Kong], 
We've got a confirmation that parallel should be done by this afternoon. They are waiting for the machine to free up, so we should be fine on timing
