comment: [~tient]: Thanks for reporting the issues. Item #2 is fixed. Moving forward, no more password prompts will occur between ca-isis-dv-02 to texas server. I will update my setup notes so that I don't have a repeat issue when I setup the new production servers in a few weeks.

I will keep this ticket assigned to me for now to address item #3 and item #4.

comment: [~tient]: Here a few code that we need to release to dev & parallel environment. If there is no issues this week, then we will release everything into production. I've done all my unit testing on dev and it works:

The program is located in:

*/d/iss/willK/proj_64b/20210505_pdst-4/*

0bc847441d451c87e564e0a43abf818d get_file_arrival.pl
b75028356f6dfc5ba9b467821559a1a3 isiszipsep_new.pl
62d606ae7c29aa0e2ed2bb9c3a47498a Setdb_estmt.pm



/home/{color:#FF0000}*util*{color}/get_file_arrival.pl

/home/master/isiszipsep_new.pl

/home/master/Setdb_estmt.pm



Once all the code is released, please re-run to see if issue occurs. The only left-over issue is/home/master/MsgCriteria.pm.  I think we need to remove Line 15: 'use Net::SSL' of code to see if it works. I'm+not+ able to install Net::SSL perl package, but i don't+think+ message manager requires this library. However, if it must have it let me know. We may need to change logic. 



If it works, then can you also add/home/master/MsgCriteria.pm to be released as well.



Thanks!

Will, I'm still getting the Net/SSL.pm error below. Let me check if I can delete call to that library or not. Errors 1 and 2 resolved. I am working on error 4 now. Thanks

Hi Will, I removed the import call to Net/SSL.pm from MsgCriteria.pm and it ran fine. Here is the new error for the paper process. Looks like format_only_host was not exported correctly. Also, I cannot run pdfi option so I need to find a new app that runs e option.

Hi Will, I processed asfcms1 archival option. Even though the job status from thea2wserver.log says "success", but there were no pdfs or index file created.
