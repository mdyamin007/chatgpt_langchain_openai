title: BBBB - User and Account are not linking
description: Hi Jatan,

Create new user and new account and link them together works good. 
When I try to add new user to the  existing account with existing CIF number from DB, the user is not added to the account:
Steps:
-	From InfoDocs AcctMgmt  search for account from DB # 14381016
-	Click on Add user -> search for CIF # 714400000070  
-	 Check radio button and click on Next -> Enroll -> User is not added 
I tried with several account numbers and CIF number and have the same result.

Second Issue with viewable statements is fixed.

Thank you,
Natasha

comment: Hi Dipak,

The InfoTRAC is sending the totalExtUserId: 714400000070\|InfoIMAGE7144TEST . However the API expecting it to be totalExtUserId: 714400000070\|\|InfoIMAGE7144TEST.

comment: Yes, the issue is in data. For new user it is storing \| with extUserId in DB but in old data it does not. We need to migrate old data with \| .
