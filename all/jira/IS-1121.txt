Please notice
Welcome loan - missing paper stock and 2D bar code


author: gthillaivel
comment: Print sample looks good ,except the 2D bar and paper stock issue


author: barnetts
comment: Hi [~Natalie.Tom],

Can you please advise on the missing paper stock and 2D bar code for the Welcome Loan?

Thanks, Barnett 


author: tuna
comment: Hi [~gthillaivel], [~Igor.Khosid],



Some pages do not havepaper stock and 2D bar code. Because we are using customized print program to remove all those values. I believe the client requested in some point. The production print files have the same missingpaper stock and 2D bar code.

Natalie is changing rate sheet only. Please pass with note.



Thanks,
