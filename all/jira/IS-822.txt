comment: Hi Nar,

Mapping document uploaded to sharepoint. This folder also includes record layout document for Black Knight Escrow EXT 1387. We have preliminary sample data set in my secure shareRatna\SEFC\IS\escrow. William should provide the original file. We should receive a new data file by end of next week 2/18.

comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com], [~phoebe.george]

What's the different between this IS-822 and IS-735 (SEFC EA Statement - Core conversion to Black Knight).

If it is the same. Can you please void this IS-822? IS- 735 is already assigned to Nar.

Thanks,

Tun



[~William.Kong], [~ratnam]


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~TunA] [~jira_naru]- I'll cancel IS-735 since this Jira already has all of the attachments.

comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]and [~William.Kong]:

Since only 90 percent of the mapping is completed. I can only provide 90 percent of the EA statement we have completed mapping for. So, if you are looking for a sample date, partial sample will be available on March 7.

Attached is the first round sample of what is mapped.

Also, attached are some mapping questions that needs clarification.

comment: Hi Steve, CU did not confirm Index portion for Escrow statements. They are still figuring if a cross reference file will be required to pull matching account number for loan number. I did notify Nar to hold E portion.



Thanks

Ratna


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~jira_naru]-FYI I updated the SOW. We are to MASK the loan numbers except the last 4 digits. I saw it was on the first page but not subsequent pages.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~jira_naru]- Please disregard what I said about masking the loan numbers. Removed from SOW. I did notice that the loan number on the first page is masked. Ratna says they should all be unmasked. FYI for next sample set.


author: ratnam
comment: Hi Nar, please generate sample using the attached file sefc.test.EXT1387.220311.2102.pgp.

Can you check with DP?

comment: I'll get that for you [~jira_naru]. [~ratnam]- FYI

comment: [~jira_naru]- Data file is saved to your share.

I generated the entire new test file but the PDF is too big to upload to JIRA.

I placed the PDF inAC Secure Shared ....\Ratna\SEFC\fromNar\


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~jira_naru]- I have down the PDF archival and Invalid address samples were due on 3/28. Status?


author: jira_naru
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]:

I thought you said the time line will be revised?


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: Hey [~jira_naru]. Yes, but we still need to keep pushing as we don't want things to fall off. Since you already have the details for this setup, when do you think you can have it ready? I'll update the timeline once you confirm. LIVE date is 7/1 so a delay isn't a big deal.


author: jira_naru
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]:

The following Archival and Invalid Report samples are now available in the client pickup folder:

!image-2022-03-29-14-49-17-812.png!

Please note that the accounts in the invalid report are random accounts from the latest test file and are not necessarily actual invalid address. These accounts are used to illustrate how the report will look.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~jira_naru]- please save to my share folder. I do not have access to the client pickup.


author: jira_naru
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]:

The two return files are in you share folder.


author: ratnam
comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]per our meeting yesterday, please hold on PDF Archival sample. CU wants to include doctype in index content and confirm the value. I will turn over SOW with updated PDF Archival Specifications to Nar once I receive all required details. You may go ahead and forward just the Invalid Address Report sample.

[~jira_naru] Please hold on E portion as Steve confirmed that CU will be providing a cross reference file to pull SEFCU Member Number for corresponding Loan Number within data file.

[~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]do you have an ETA when CU is expected to send InfoIMAGE the cross reference file.



Thanks

I placed the revised sample in Ratna's secured shared...\SEFC\fromNar\sefc.test.EXT1387.220311.2102_sample_050620220416.pdf.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: Thanks [~jira_naru]. [~ratnam]- I opened up another ticket for EA samples. TS 29007


author: ratnam
comment: Hi [~jira_naru] please review below feedback from CU. I can set up a call to over mapping updates.



"Do these samples display all mapping for the shortage, surplus, and short year scenarios?
 We are seeing some verbiage that was not expected so I wanted to confirm that the mapping we completed in late April is reflected on these statements.
 For example - SEFCU asked to remove the "If you choose to pay your shortage of..." from the Escrow Account section, but I am reviewing samples and see this displayed. I just want to make sure we understand what InfoIMAGE completed programming wise before conducting the sample review."



Thanks

Ratna


author: jira_naru
comment: [~ratnam]:

Yes, the sample generated was based on the latest mapping for shortage, surplus and short year scenario.

If you see discrepancies, please provided account number and account name along with scene shot and how we should proceed to correct it.


author: ratnam
comment: [~jira_naru]Please review the updated mapping from 04/26 for standard template. The samples do not reflect the updates from mapping document. For example: "If you choose to pay...", this paragraph needs to be removed. And there is a change in verbiage in second paragraph.

comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]I am updating SOW and observed that this is the only application missing bounce back report specifications. Please confirm if this is not required?

comment: [~jira_naru]- can you please create an index file for ISD?


author: ratnam
comment: Hi [~jira_naru]CU wants to change eStatement index to use *DNA_Account* within cross reference file instead of Member_Number. I updated SOW. Please review and program accordingly.



Thanks

Ratna


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~jira_naru]- Please note, CU may have further updates. They are reviewing tomorrow and will confirm by EOD.
