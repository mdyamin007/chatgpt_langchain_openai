Print Samples Requested

comment: [~barnetts]

After OPs print the sample, please scan it for client review and approval. QA will start after client approval.


author: barnetts
comment: [~eric.yan],

Can you please provide a DPVS. OPS is not able to print the Print samples.

Thanks, Barnett 


author: eric.yan
comment: [~barnetts]

There is no DPVS for this one, It's testing eform preprint. I think OPs just need the print file name above to print out the file.

123456_ofcume11314.2o1.afp.

They could send me a email if there's any question.

Please see Calvin response below. 
OFCU Visa & Heloc is printed on the i300 printers in CA.  Please provide DPVS for this sample request.

comment: Hi [~eric.yan],

Please see OPS response below. Can you please send a DPVS
In order for us to print the file, we need a Proc id#. In order to locate the file in PRISMA. I did search for the file 123456_ofcume11314.2o1.afp. but did not see it.

comment: VISA needs it's own preprint. The eform needs to be created when the preprint is ready.


author: tuna
comment: HI [~barnetts],

If the client need own preprint for VISA, please open separate programming request.



We cannot add on this. We will need to complete this project first.

Thanks,
