comment: [~Ethan.Yu] In addition to creating the ESTMT_DOC records for duplicate statements. Please make sure we're also inserting a record into P_JOB_ESTMT with the correct p_job_id and newly created esd_id. This ensures that if the original cycle gets undo, it'll take down the duplicate statement as well. I don't believe this is covered in Michael's script so it will need to be added.
