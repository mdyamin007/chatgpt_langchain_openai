title: WEST SSO/DSO Setup
description: WEST SSO/DSO Setup.
WEST likes the eStmt site.  They would like to update with their colors and logo's.  Please see attached.


author: diegof
comment: WEST currently uses a CIF file that is based on characters as opposed to a delimited file. I spoke with Tai and he mentioned we are still able to work with the file as long as we have all necessary items. The file is CIF.TXT in /d/ftpbu/westbu/test/ and the layout is below. We are working to get in contact with their SSO vendor to make sure we are all passing in the correct values. Please note some of the fields we wont need. The client does not have changes to this file within their scope currently but might be willing to work on it if there is an absolute necessity to change it. Please let me know your thoughts.

comment: [~jahid.hasan]i believe everything is updated on the confluence page for this client. I spoke to Tai and he mentioned it may be possible to provide a site to NCR and Bottomline earlier then completing the whole setup just so we can see some test calls come over and to make sure all the information matches up to what we expect. Is this possible? I can let them know this is not the final functionality. Let me know if that can be accomplished and when.

comment: [~diegof]We can provide you the link for ncr tomorrow. I have sent mail to network team to enable the url. After enabling url by network team, ncr can hit the site. Tomorrow I will let you know the update about bottomline.

Here is the log information for west:[^west_log_2022-05-20.txt]


author: diegof
comment: does this mean they are passing account type NA?


author: JIRAUSER11102
comment: They are passing account type as 1. Since west has no account type, account type value is being posted as NA in database.


author: diegof
comment: okay so they are passing in an acct type.


author: JIRAUSER11102
comment: Yes, they are.

^[~sahossain] please take a look at the file above. They put blanks instead of empty. Not sure if that will cause issues but if it doesnt then please ingest the file. Client is aware it is missing a lot of emails.^

I processed the above file on pilot. Total *8740*data have been successfully posted from *155083*, and *146343*data failed due to missing email addresses.

comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com],

Should we remove leading zeroes from CIF?

Will client pass CIF with leading zeroes or without leading zeroes during SSO?

Thanks!


author: diegof
comment: can you review the log to determine this?


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~sahossain] [~diegof]- Bank cannot pull up any eStatements. Please advise.



_I am not seeing any statement samples through the pilot site. It doesn't give me an option to change the date or select any of the savings accounts from the list._

comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]
 # They can't see any savings statements sample in pilot for Account Number *102498003* and *102498136*. Because these accounts don't have statements. 
For savings statements they can use the following credential:
*CIF: 0001859160*
*acctNum: 2503281467*
Or for testing, they can use account numbers from the *ms3_20220831_1_20221010_2010_west.txt index* file.
 # I don't know why they said can't change the date. They can choose the date between the last 24 months from the calendar.

!chooseDate.png|thumbnail!
 # The dropdown list is showing the account numbers with nicknames. Provided nickname will be shown with account number. So if they pass account description as 'Savings' then it will be shown with the account numberm

Thanks!


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: Hi [~sahossain]- Why does your screen show Savings and Checking on the top left? WEST screenshot doesn't have that.

Also, please see attached disclosure. Please update on site.

Please also update email [toeStatements@westamerica.com.|mailto:to%C2%A0eStatements@westamerica.com.] Please remove phone number from being displayed. The bank does not want customers to call. The delivery preference message is ok.

I updated the disclosure for both Step 2 and statement page on pilot.

Also updated"WestAmerica" to "Westamerica" as you mentioned.



I implemented a new feature for bottomline that removed leading zeroes from account number based on flag.

Thanks!

comment: [~sahossain] I discussed the WEST issue with [~Tin.Chak] and we need your help to prioritize the trouble-shooting as to why the customer cannot see the documents on the pilot via SSO.

Can you check the SSO logs based on the accounts that they have used to test? Steve confirmed he can see these on InfoTrac pilot, so he knows they are posted:

2158914412
2406088621
2272951316
2255348084
2502193242
2170943639
2203106014

Also, please confirm that we are not reading in the Account Type via the SSO, since there is no account types for the setup.

We need this issue resolved ASAP so WEST can approve the pilot site. Please let us know if a trouble-shooting call is needed with NCR and/or client once you have reviewed the SSO logs.

[~Tin.Chak] Please add anything else that Sarwar should check in order to trouble-shoot this issue.

[~diegof] [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] FYI

comment: [~sahossain] Review the log and use the SSO request the client used to see what if there's any documents. I disabled the doc needApproval on pilot PUI.

comment: [~phoebe.george],

I don't see any logs for the accounts you provided in our proxy servers, and they don't have sso dates either. This means these accounts never logged in to our system. As far as I'm told, these accounts logged in but didn't see any statements. But I'm not sure what the issue is as I do not see any error logs or any logs for that matter. Meen and I tried to do sso for acct number 2406088621 and we were able to successfully log in and see statement. Do you know when they tested with these accounts? Also, if possible, can they try these accounts again? Because I see statements for these accounts and they should be able to see them if they can login successfully.

I found out later today that these are some logs for cif number 572712782 that Steve provided on the zoom channel. I'll be looking into that tomorrow.

[~Tin.Chak] FYI

Thanks,
Rifat

I reviewed 2 CIFS that Steve provided - Heather: 000409004, Patty: 572712782. These 2 CIFS have 102498136 account number in common. I was able to do SSO with CIF 572712782 and I was able to view DDA statement for account number 102498136. I don't see any issue with it. Can you ask the client to test again so that we can monitor the logs for hypercube?

Let me know what you think.

Thanks

comment: Hi [~enricob]

I processed preEnrollment file previously and some data failed due to missing email addresses. You mentioned on 6 October client working on new preEnrollment file but I didn't get new file yet.

What is the current status of this file?
 Note: If they didn't provide email address then status will be 'P' instead of 'E'.

Thanks!
