Wilson,
 # please export the project to QA folder.
 # please provide correct pdf samples for client review - the first page should be a letter and then the disclosure.

comment: [~Igor.Khosid] [~berezinez] [~dyuen] Sorry for the confusion, the sample I gave was from supposed to be pages 1 - 200. But I think I mistakenly generated pages 2 - 200, so that's why you are seeing this. I generated the sample again, please review this sample. And the QA folder is updated, thanks!
