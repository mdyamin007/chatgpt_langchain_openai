title: 28551 - EQBK - FTP site issue
description: From Networks:

The error they are seeing is due to the FTP server having older TLS protocol enabled and the browser is rejecting it. 

The best option is that the switch over to connecting with SFTP instead. Using an FTP client such as CoreFTP or Filezilla could do this.
