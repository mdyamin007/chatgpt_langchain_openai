title: 17274 / 47601 - Implement MFA TTL feature on hypercube
description: A new flag named "mfaTTL" will be added on hypercube to set TTL time for MFA token.

comment: ALCU ttl will be 30 minutes.



Also, can we change the flag to:

"mfa": {

"ttl":

}

instead? That way we can group all mfa related flags together in case we need more of them later.

Hypercube automatically takes the user to the logout page for all clients if there is no interaction within 10min. So setting the MFA ttl for 30min is useless. We can set ttl less than 10min for proper use. I have already implemented the code for MFA ttl. What should I do for ALCU mfa ttl?

Below is the screenshot of the session time out after 10min.

Let's have the token timeout be 10 minutes. That's what the client is requesting now. It is right exactly when the site timeout, but there can be a case where a user remains somewhat active for 2-3 minutes, and that would extends the site timeout to be 2-3 minutes longer than when the token would timeout.

Thanks,
Tai
