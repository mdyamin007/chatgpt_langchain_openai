title: INHS - API BounceBack Report Logic byUsr & byUfa
description: This ticket is to modify the API BounceBack Report to support clients that have Notification Preference tables linked byUsr & byUfa. Currently the logic only supports clients linked byAcct.

Technically this means, byUfa is not a necessary added measurement, but might be nice to add in anyways.
