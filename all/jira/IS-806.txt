comment: Hi [~fahad]- Please see attached. Please move "Account Statement" to over on the right. You can remove the line "If you have any questions about your account, please call" to make room.

comment: [~fahad]- Please note, per William, we will need to enable AOLP via InfoTrac for the first cycle only so the bank can review an approve the first set of samples. Please let me know if you need anything. I'll let ISD know they need to turn on as well.


author: mousumis
comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com], [~enricob],
The sample is attached here. Please review and let us know if there is any issue.
Thank you.

N.B.
1) We have removed the particular digits which placed beside the address part.
2) The footer line is added only for first page.
3) If the address part has blank line in the middle, then we have removed that blank line. 
4) If the account does not have any transaction, then we have removed the horizontal line. 
5) And we dont have the check image specification, so we cant provide sample with check image info.

comment: Hi [~fahad]- Please see attached. Why is the message at the end of the statements printing so it interferes with the transaction line? This is located on page 6.

We can't adjust the data in one page also as it contained 9 column data, I don't think we can adjust it in sidewise also.
Have a look and advise.
Thanks.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: Hi [~fahad]- can you please elaborate? I can't tell so much from the screenshot you sent.


author: JIRAUSER10910
comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com],

There's some contents which is getting printed on first page. If we enlarge the font the page gets overflowed which should be in first page. we can't move it up as there is no space to move. Also the the last line contains 9 columns which can't be distributed accordingly due to lack of space if we enlarge it.
I hope I can make it understandable to you. But still let me know what you think.
Also we might find some solutions if we know what the client actually wants. Can you request to know that?
Thanks.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~fahad]- Can you enlarge the font only in the area I highlighted?

author: JIRAUSER10910
comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com],

I just enlarged it by 1 pt. Initially we used size 9. then when you asked me to enlarge it I used size 10.

comment: [~fahad]- is there a font 9.5?


author: JIRAUSER10910

 +*For the Issue no. 2 :*+
 !image-2022-06-16-14-46-56-710.png!

It seems the issue is from data. We are missing the anchor (*"date balance"*) to pick product name or find the place where to put the *"Account Activity & Balance Summary"* Line. without there's no way to find out where to put these line.

+*For the Issue no. 3:*+
 Sorry, We can't adjust the size for the font of name & address. This is infoimage standard to always print the name and address at *position 1.5 Inch Horizontally and 2 Inch Vertically with Font Arial Size 8pt*.

+*For the Issue no. 5:*+

**Sorry I didn't understand what you mean by that. Are you asking whether we are printing all of the data coming from the data file?
 We are printing as is for all of the data without some from the first page.

+*For the Issue no. 6:*+

The account number mentioned is not contained in the data file that I have. Please provide a data file containing those accounts.


 Thanks.

This statement is from their test file below. You can see the line and "Account Activity" and "Balance Summary" are both present. What is different from this data file to what was processed? You mentioned that we are missing the anchor ("date balance") to pick product name or find the place where to put the "Account Activity & Balance Summary" Line. Can you show me in the data file so I can show FIS?

Now Here's the data we are having issues with.

!image-2022-06-20-15-36-16-028.png!

Can you see the difference? Now if we don't have this "date balance" anchor. Then please confirm that first line after "SPECL HANDL" will always come it will never be absent. Also it will always be "30 days this circle".So that we can pin point where to put which hardcoded lines. thanks.

In the meantime, they have 1 more update request.

Yes, There is statement with this verbage. here's a snippet of data. thanks
!image-2022-06-30-12-58-50-653.png!


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: Hi [~fahad]- See below from the bank and advise if this solution will work.

Below is an example of a DDA statement with no transactions (first one from last nights file). First is the raw data file and second is the rendered statement. I replaced the name/acct# in the raw data file.



SPECL HANDL is not always present, so it cant be used.

The next line with checks and withdrawals, deposits and credits, etc. is always there but the figures could change.

The next line with the product description is always there but the text could change.

What I recommend is using DAYS THIS CYCLE. That verbiage will always be present and begin in column 35. I wouldnt use the number of days before the text, as it could change. Let me know if this solution is not acceptable.

Did you only used the_WEST_IMAGE_20220831_220512.X937 check image file? the check image files are a daily file, so we need some cumulative check images to display it. Can you run all the check images below and see if it produce better numbers?_

It looks like there's still error while parsing. I usedX937_EXT3 as peter advised.

please advise.

FIS sent us a new 8/31 RECON file for us to test. I attached it here. Please test if this resolved the missing checks from the recon file.

new items file.7z



Thanks,

comment: Hi [~fahad],



From what I seen in the error log and compare it to the X9.37 file, the ones that has errors are not real checks. Please proceed with using theX937_EXT3 to process the others. Also please process the entire september check image files in ftpbu/westbu/dda/temp folder

Thanks,

*If you look at the screen shot above... there's no change on total errors... Both of the X937 (WHITE) and X937_EXT3 (BLUE) same number of errors for the same check images.*
Thanks.


author: enricob
comment: ok, that means the EXT1 program works with this check images the same as EXT3. I reviewed the 8/31 check image error log and all the errors are for non check images. I haven't reviewed the other files but it most likely the same case.



Did you try running the updated recon file attached here? We need to know if that fixes the missing check images data from recon file.


author: enricob
comment: Hi [~fahad],

There are some check images where the check number is in the MICR On-US . I mentioned this during the turnover. Can you check with Anwar or Rony if these can be programmed so it can be extracted? I think we did this for some other clients.

*DDA Statements* has more contents then *Savings Statements*. So It can't be made to look exactly same as this.
But Do you want it to look something like this? Please advise..
!image-2022-10-31-17-06-17-684.png!


Also as [~enricob]suggested, I didn't parsed the check images. *So After completing the updated do you want me to generate sample without check images*?
Thanks!

author: enricob
comment: Hi [~fahad],



I reviewed the new check image file and noticed that almost all images has auxiliary ONUS field populated. There is no longer any check number in the MICR on US. You might need to update the code to support this.

comment: I'm still checking on the error check images, but I confirmed that the duplicate check images are somewhat the same. They are not checks that we should be a concern of since they are all deposit type checks.



We will be using the new check image file going forward. 


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~fahad]- 1 update request and 1 question...

Update - Can you make the font the same as Savings? I can ask Anwar what font he used in tomorrow's meeting.

Question - Account503072001 should have 149 pages. In the PDF archival loaded onto Image Center, it only has 2 pages. When I look at your index file, it has 83 pages. Please advise.

For the Commercial CD, the client mentioned that they want want the check images to include the deposit slips.

+*Query 1:*+

_Savings and DDA both using the same font but the font size is different. Savings is using *size 10* and DDA is currently using the font *size 9.5* and *we can't make it bigger*. Other wise the bottom content of the first page doesn't fit in. *It breaks down.*_

+*Query 2:*+
 _The *Account (503072001)* you reported issue with page count, I looked into it. Here's my findings._
{quote}
h4. *1. It seems the data file has total of 17 pages.*

*!image-2022-11-15-13-03-32-039.png!*
h4. *2. As the statement has backer in it, total statement pages should be 18 in total. Also the archival PDF data statement total page is 18 which is from +PAGE69239 - 69256+.*

*!image-2022-11-15-13-12-44-347.png!*
h4. *3. In the PDF, from PAGE 69257 rest of the pages are check images. And as you already know we haven't got**any confirmation so rest of the page count may not be accurate. What I meant by inaccuracy is that you said there should be 149 pages and we got only 18 pages of data (including backer) so rest of the 131 pages are check images. but in our case we printed 65 pages of check images. It's due to lack of check image information in the DDARECON file. But we printed all that we have in our hand currently.*

*!image-2022-11-15-13-22-39-550.png!*
{quote}


*_+Now I've got some queries. Please advise on the following queries:+_*
{quote}
h4. *1. How is image center looking into the Archival PDF Statement ? As it seems they found 2 pages in the PDF and we found all of the 83 pages in the PDF.*
h4. *2. How they determined there should be total of 149 pages?*

_*Let me know what you think about my analysis.*_

It seems there's still a lot of the account which doesn't contain any information in the DDARECON file.
So advise whether should we consider them as Cripple Statement or not?
Thanks.

comment: [~fahad]- Follow up to the question below. Can you show me what it will look like? Not sure what you mean by breaks down.

Client mentioned that they found that checks that have front and back side are not side by side in the check page. Often the front and back is on a different page. Diego found a statement sample where the entire pages are just back side image only.  Can you review and fix?

We received an updated check image file that contain the sequence number. This should match the combination of Item Batch + Item Seq in the DDA Recon file.

comment: [~fahad], Also there is a new business rule for checks. Recycled statements would NOT have any checks. This applies to all print, eStmt, archival , or CD. So recycled statement should not be counted in the cripple rate.
