comment: [~dyuen] I just noticed the IS ticket status is Cancelled, therefore I'm going to update the status for the ISD story as well.

comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima], official turnover date is today. Re-opening ISD story. Thanks

comment: Thanks [~dyuen], since this is an inline insert, at most this is just a potential resource upload and testing/validation from ISD's side. We will need an index file from IS in order to validate statements.
