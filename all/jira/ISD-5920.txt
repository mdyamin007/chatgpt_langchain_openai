I'm seeing overlapping and text misalignment for both letter types. Could you check if the format step has the same issue?

The format afp looks fine. The afp in the zip file for enotices look okay too.

comment: Hi [~jun]

I ran into a similar issue with another job and it turned out the overlapping was caused by DFA not using updated resources under different job_type. Could you double-check on that in the DFA? Thanks.

I changed the job selection to f and it looks okay. Could it be there is setting to control simplex/duplex? This letter is set up as simplex.

I think afp2web won't be affected by simplex/duplex. Could you generate another index file for testing?
