Can you confirm the control file should have update as

eStmtSelInsFlag=TRUE or export eStmtSelInsFlag=TRUE ?


author: JIRAUSER10912
comment: Hi [~gthillaivel]

The control file is updated now.
 Firstly I added,    *eStmtSelInsFlag="TRUE"*
 then ,           *export eStmtSelInsFlag*

Can you please post the latest index file/z/isd_input_dev/I3/process-files/bkpl/*ms2_20220725_1_20220831_1255_bkpl.txt*
