title: 41553 - GCBK - Delete user tab
description: Create a new tab for GCBK admin site 'Delete User'. We should be able to query similar to account management on the admin site for account number, email, and CIF.

After selecting the specific user or account, we would delete the UFA link so the user and the account are not tied together.
