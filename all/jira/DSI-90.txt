title: EPCU - New Report Scheduler Exception
description: EPCU started using the "Report Scheduler" on the PUI for their bounceback email report.  There's a null pointer exception where the "File Header" value is not set in the PUI.  Update the code so if "File Header" field is empty, it will not insert the header and the first line will start with the file Content.
