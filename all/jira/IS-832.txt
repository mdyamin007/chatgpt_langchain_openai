comment: [~MattL]Yes, code can be released once QA is completed.


author: william.kong
comment: [~MattL]: Let's target 2/28/2022 afternoon around 2pm PST; This is just verbiage chance so that should give OPS & QA plenty of time to get print samples and have this approved by then.



For now, I will update the due date to be 2/28/2022.



[~jun]: FYI.
