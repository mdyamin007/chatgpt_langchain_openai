comment: [~tai.trinh]Client advised that they're getting the following error when they tried to review the samples: !image-2021-08-24-09-49-01-597.png!

I receive the following error message in test when trying to view statements. I am not sure we have a good test environment to test this in. I will open an NCR ticket as well.

comment: Hi [~tai.trinh]

Client Cannot see member statements in pre-prod. they are getting a FMIS-1014 error. i also cannot enroll in estatement in my account on pre-prod as there is no button to actually enroll.

I do not know that we can test this in pre-prod. Is there any other way we can test this?


V/r
