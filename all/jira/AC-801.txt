title: MFCU - [30643][pvt] Letter 157 Lease Counter Offer (AL-DL-07-10/19) New Cover Letter to be sent with recreated adverse actions letters that were missing key factors
description: All these 3 letters are exactly the same analysis I think you can send one WO or 3 as you wish.

I see that on the ticket 30302 you have sent the WO . this is the Analysis.



And we DO NOT need to wait for test file we can use existing data files for testing and even get them to

approve samples - and hold the code till they provide the "Final file for which they want these letters to be added" that file is NO different from their existing files .

So once you get the 3 WO signed we can push to Jira and follow SOP and then hold till they are ready with final files for each of theses letters.
I updated the description with this ticket name see*bolded*
