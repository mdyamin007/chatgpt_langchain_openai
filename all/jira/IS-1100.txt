comment: [~rony], RWCU responded with the following:

This looks correct although it looks like our data file does not contain the full account number.

Let me look into where we are on this and I will get a new test file with the full account numbers.



I will let you know when we get a new test file so that the archival can include full account numbers.

Thanks
