title: FCBT - eStatements: Purge Bad Test Data
description: Purge all accounts linked to three specific email addresses, and the users as well (Confirm the user portion) for 5 associations: FCBA, CTFC, PLBA, CAFC, and MILB.

Looking at the list for the "Purge by Email", I see that the client actually provide a list of account numbers also? Can I assume that list is comprehensive? Then we can just purge those account numbers. - YES


 

For both

TO: 11/4

Pilot: N/A (11/13)

Live: 11/13

comment: Set up purge account internally for FCBA, CTFC, PLBA, CAFC, and MILB. Then use the Excel attached and pull the account numbers + type to put into index file for purging process.

The excel sheet contains accts in more associations than mentioned in the description:

Description: FCBA, CTFC, PLBA, CAFC, and MILB
Excel file: AGAL, AGFC, CAFC, CTFC, PLBA, HLBK, TXFC (it just says 'ALL CLEAN' for MILB and FCBA).

Can you confirm if we should still only focus on the 5 associations or if we should handle everything included in the excel file?

comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] Please include all that is part of the excel file.

Due to the original hours quoted (which was based on the 5), please let me know if there are additional hours that I should add to the work order to include all CID's listed on the excel sheet.


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~phoebe.george] Thanks for confirming, I think it's fine to keep the hours as is.

I was looking through CIF Number and Account Number of AGAL Bank. I am seeing gaps in information provided to us. We can purge Account Numbers independence of CIF Number. However, CIF Number cannot be purged unless all associated Account Numbers have been purged.

1. I am seeing unlisted Account Numbers that are associated with the provided CIF Numbers.  Can I purge these unlisted Account Numbers so that listed CIF Numbers can be purged?

2. I am also seeing unlisted CIF Numbers that are associated with provided Account Numbers. Should I purge these unlisted CIF Numbers and their associated unlisted Account Numbers?

3. How should I proceed if the same data situation arises for other CIDs?

Thanks.

I have generated a list of [Org, CIF Number, Account Number, Account Type, Name, Email] in FCBT_PurgeBadTestData_byEmail.xlsx based on these email addresses:

deepak.boora@farmcreditbank.com
dlbusinesssystemssupport@farmcreditbank.com
kathy.collins@farmcreditbank.com
richard.bates@farmcreditbank.com
tlaigast@farmcreditbank.com
troy.laigast@farmcreditabnk.com
troy.laigast@farmcreditbank.com
vicki.ralston@farmcreditbank.com

1. Can you confirm that FCT is affiliated with all these orgs? The list covers users and accounts from these orgs. (agal, agfc, agnm, alfc, cafc, ctfc, fcba, hlbk, laca, lalb, lsac, milb, plba, sagc, txfc)

2. If the answer to Q1 is yes, please ask the client to confirm which users and accounts in the list can be purged.

Thanks.

author: tai.trinh
comment: Also purge all accounts that are not of type LN for the 5 associations:FCBA, CTFC, PLBA, CAFC, and MILB.

This will be a different list from the ones regarding the emails.

For this, users should not be removed.


author: JIRAUSER10914
comment: Hi [~phoebe.george],

It will be done by Tuesday end of day unless the client wants to see and confirm the list of non-LN accounts that are associated with CAFC, CTFC, FCBA, MILB and PLBA which I am about to purge.

I have found more records that need to be purged based on emails. There is a small chance that this task will spill over to tomorrow. I will keep you updated.
