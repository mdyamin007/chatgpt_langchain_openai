title: Return Mail Question - GCBK
description: Also, on the Bad Mail Process  Fiserv DNA has an App we can use that accepts a file import and would automatically flag the accounts, etc. in our Core System. The manual back-end piece we discussed. It does however require a special format. We are curious if you could send a file back in this format and what cost would be associated with a custom file? I would have to confirm, but Im wondering if we wouldnt still want the standard Return Report you provided us because that has additional information that may be useful. We could also look to create our own file from your report, but wanted to see if you could provide first. Ive attached the Fiserv DNA layout for review.
