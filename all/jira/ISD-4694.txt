Are there samples for this for the client to review?

Will nickname be available for all the accounts? If the nickname is not available for any account what would be the expected behaviour?


author: patric k
comment: [~abdullah.baki], If there is no nickname, then display the default info.

comment: QA: Please test on pilot via sso test page. Choose 'SSO7 nickname' tab. Then modify the cif to simulate a new user. Change the "AcctDesc:" to a description you like.

You should be taken into the the enrollment steps and see your nickname in front of the account number (see images).
