description: Client is having issue with decrypting ml1

per client:

The PSI Tech key is not our key. I believe that is the key for Fiserv. Can you please use the Columbia Credit Union key for all our items?

This is the key that needs to be used

PublicKey-COLU.zip

comment: [~OIR]Wilson, please use this key, "Columbia Credit Union <[is@columbiacu.org|mailto:is@columbiacu.org]>", for ml1.

comment: [~Igor.Khosid] The only change I made is this line in the columl1_processing script, updating the encryption key from encryptionKey="PSI Technologies Corporation <keymaster@psiaustin.com>" to  encryptionKey="Columbia Credit Union <is@columbiacu.org>". Thanks!
