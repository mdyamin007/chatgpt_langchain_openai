I am running this on Pilot and it's missing a piece code in datatrac DB. Please ask PC to piece code for for139337-C01.01-V22761 in Pilot.

comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] I'm seeing this error "Can't replicate the pieceCode info in InfoTRAC!" in the index file posting on pilot. On InfoTRAC pilot Insert Management tab, I don't see any approved mortgage entries. I only see three approved and all of them are Stmt, not mortgage. Can you check?


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima]- Ok, I set up form 4047 with selective insert 33473. Good now?


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] I was able to repost successfully, please verify on pilot. You will need to approve the job first before it can be viewed under Account Management. Here are some accounts with the insert:
1705915809
1705948644
1705937390


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: Hi [~Shun.Kuwashima]- I'm not seeing the inserts on pilot for these 3 accounts. Please advise.


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] the job needs to be approved first under job status before it is viewable under account management. Please search for 139337-C01.01-V22761 under the estatement tab on job status to approve it.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima]- Ok done. I'm seeing the Mortgage stmts now but don't see the insert. Please advise.


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] I'm not sure why this is happening yet, however I tested via SSO and I can see the insert on the pilot hypercube site so the issue seems to be just infotrac. I don't think it's related to the job status issue on stage, but will need to look into it further. If I'm not able to figure out by eod, I'll ask our offshore team to research.

Update: I sent an email to offshore just now, pending their response.


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] DSI fixed the issue, I just checked and the 'Late Charge' selective insert should be showing now on infotrac pilot. Can you check again using the accts I provided yesterday?


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima]- Confirmed. Looks good. Can we move to QA now? Please confirm and I'll update the Jira's.


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] Yeah

Also, please create a jira story for ISD as well. There was a flag that was rolled back on our end on production only, thus we need to be notified to make the update once this goes live.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com

author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~gthillaivel] [~jun] It's not an error, most of the accounts in this file don't have the selective insert. In such case, we need to manually search for the piece code 33473 in the logs and find the accounts that way. Screenshot below:
