title: Brisbane:  Message Manager Not Working b/c RHS has no license
description: Ernest/Will,



Anil is sending MM3 requests to 10.4.20.31 (RHS), not RHS2. Theres no Papyrus license on that machine causing the reported error.



Please let him know when you can switch the license over to RHS so he can resume his testing.



Thanks

Tien

All,

comment: [~anil.dasa], [~Velasco], and [~ernestw]: Here is the plan that I spoke to you guys separately:



10/16: Tonight, I will swap RH2 test license and assign it to RHS server; I will confirm that no jobs are running on RH2 before I swap license. Roughly at 8pm. Once I'm done, i will assign this ticket to Anil.



10/17: Anil will create message manager message for cycle 9/15. Once you are done, please assign ticket to Neil so that he can find time on Saturday to process. Preferably in the morning since both of you guys are in the Texas time zone.



Thanks!

comment: [~anil.dasa]: I re-assigned the key. Please try to create the message manager message. If it works, please re-assign ticket to Neil so that he knows when to run the job.





[~Velasco]: FYI.

comment: [~yameelee]:  Can you help me research why cycle 9/15 on RHS*production* did not generate check images and got 100% cripple rate. That is why it did not generate eStatements.



[~anil.dasa]:  Please also review the comment above about indexfileprocessor issue above.

comment: I cannot find anything on check image process error but there is nothing in /d/prep/banb/. No images and no log, like it did not even get processed.

comment: Got this email from data center yesterday. So seems it did try to but nothing gets parsed.

Dear Valued Customer,



We have processed the following check images from file BANB_statement_20200915.zip.pgp on 10/17/2020:



Index file name: Statement323371076Index20200914.xml

Index file size: 1413610

Image file name: Statement323371076Images202009140001.img

Image file size: 43862463



Total Images Parsed: 0


author: william.kong
comment: [~yameelee]:  That is the issue. Why didn't the program extract the check images? Was the check image file empty or did it fail at preprocessing02 level? 



You can re-run the job if needed:

/home/master/banbds1_process.sh 1 bypass b

comment: [~anil.dasa]: Per our conversation, port 8980 is not opened on our rhs2 server. I will ask Network team to open it. Thx



[~yameelee]: Please keep me posted on the check image issue.

comment: 

[~Peter.Dang] and [~yameelee]:How do we troubleshoot this further to identify why it is not working in Brisbane? Can you guys work together to add some troubleshooting logic to identify the source of the issue? Please advise.



[~yameelee]: Adding your email below you sent earlier so that we don't lose the history or emails:





I tried to process BANB check images manually. Nothing gets processed. No error. Not sure what the issue is. Seems issue with the parsing.
