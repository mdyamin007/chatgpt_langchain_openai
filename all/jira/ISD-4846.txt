Can you please assist? I'm not seeing it on Pilot. It only lists acct # 20012480584, but I'm not seeing it on there.

Thanks, Barnett

I processed the provided index file by Eric and none of the accounts existed and account creation is disabled for enotices. Account creation is also disabled on production as well. Should we enable account creation? If so, should we also enable it for production?

Thanks, Mac

comment: Hi [~mac], 

My apologies for the delay. Yes, we should enable account creation for eNotices.

[~Shun.Kuwashima], Do you know why account creation is disabled for enotices. Account creation is also disabled on production as well. Should we enable account creation? If so, should we also enable it for production?

Thanks, Barnett

comment: [~barnetts], I do not know why it's disabled, I'm assuming that is what was agreed upon their original setup. Also in terms of your questions about production, I asked Mac to ask you those questions. Please confirm if we should have enotice account creation enabled on production as well, and if so please have it documented in the SOW so it aligns with what we have/will have configured.

Thanks,
Shun
