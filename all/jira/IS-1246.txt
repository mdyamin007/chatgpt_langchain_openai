The one with blank job id and 999999 dt jobid was created during testing.

Please check the job status with dt job id "139281-C00.01-V22796"


author: andreav
comment: [~jun] - Please remove the one from testing as this will cause confusion to the client when reviewing InfoTRAC pilot for approval. 
I have created and shared a feedback Smartsheet, please take a look, client has provided one feedback so far regarding the Tax ID number.

Samples are updated according to spreadsheet. The new samples "mfcums2_Samples_0804.pdf" created and placed in AC share folder.


author: andreav
comment: [~jun] - Just fyi, you are using the old AC secure share folder. We should be using the new AC secure share that William K. sent out. I see the samples and will forward to client.  Please confirm you posted them on InfoTRAC pilot too.


author: jun
comment: [~andreav], The print on infotrac is updated. I just added the new share folder. I'll copy samples there next time.

Due date (09/02) is over. Do we have estimated new release date for this project? 
If yes, please let [~jun] knows.

For now, I will postpone live date to (09/30).

Thanks

author: andreav
comment: [~TunA] - No new estimated date yet until client can test the new archival sample and provide approval.
[~ratnam] - Hi Ratna, have you had a chance to review the new archival sample? If good, can you provide to the client for testing and approval?


author: ratnam
comment: [~andreav]samples look good. I requested DP to place them in client pick.

comment: [~jun], [~ratnam]- Client's email from 9/29:

I got a chance to test on archiving these statements to our DEV database. I ran into issues here with the statement names. 
Here is how the old statement names file should be (see screenshot). The loan ID should be last number string in the file name (yellow highlighted). 

  !screenshot-6.png|thumbnail! 

InfoImage statement names are below (see screenshot).  Can you please advise what are these numbers that I highlighted from your statement file names? They dont match SD LoanID number from the statement. The archiving process will parse LOANID from statement file name and match them with SD LoanID. Again, we run into errors as they are not valid LoanID.

  !screenshot-7.png|thumbnail! 

 

This is the results after our archiving process parse the LoanID from statement file name. You can see none of them are valid LoanID. 

  !screenshot-8.png|thumbnail! 

If you want, we can schedule a meeting to discuss about this. Its much easier and clearer when we can meet and go over it visually.

Thanks.
