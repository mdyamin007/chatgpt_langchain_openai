title: PV-NAS and Input VM Request
description: Prem,



Per my discussion with Kent, we will need the following VM instances. Can you also help confirm if the current gitlab server (10.8.9.193) can be clone? If not, we will need one VM for this as well.

+Input:+

Name: ca-input-pr-01

2 CPU, 4 GB memory, 200 GB Storage


+PV-NAS+

Name: ca-pvnas-pr-01

2 CPU, 4 GB memory, 200 GB Storage



Thanks

David

The GitLab-server is on the newest hypervisor which we gonna carry over to BB.

Also we can clone if we needed too.



I will update you on the requested new VM.



Thanks,

Prem
