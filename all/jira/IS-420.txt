comment: Per the client: We need anywhere that references *Merchants Bank of Commerce*, changed to *Merchants Bank of Commerce, a division of Columbia Bank*.

Looks like the PR assessment did not include updating the subsequent pages logo for DDA paper - which is black and white (same as daily notices).

I have asked Jason to make this update as well. This should be an additional 1hr update but I am not sure if you still want to add it on to billing.

comment: Hi YaMee,

I did include an hour for e, is that what you are referring to?

author: yameelee
comment: No, it's for paper. subsequent pages has black and white logo not eform and needs to be updated as well.

comment: HI [~yameelee] Are you waiting for anything on my end? Also, will this require a resource file?



thank you in advance!


author: kdishroon
comment: Hi YaMee,

I am waiting for the AM to confirm if we should bill for the additional hour because it was after the client already signed the estimate. Please proceed with programming and we will work that out.

Thank-you,

Keri

comment: [~tye.wu@infoimageinc.com]: Client does not have estmt, so I don't think you need anything.

comment: [~jasonV]& [~Peter.Dang]: Spoke with [~kdishroon]; Because of the rush, we will bypass parallel since this is just a logo change. [~kdishroon]will ensure client reviews productions before releasing.


author: kdishroon
comment: [~jasonV]Please let me know when code is released.


author: william.kong
comment: [~jasonV]/[~Peter.Dang]: Please HOLD code release until Monday. [~kdishroon]just sparked me at 2pm (9 min ago) that RCBK wants to code to release on Monday. She will coordinate with DP to hold processing until we get a confirmation from you or Peter that code has been released on Monday morning.


author: kdishroon
comment: [~jasonV] Per our conversation, please release code on Monday.


author: JIRAUSER11003
comment: [~Peter.Dang] [~kdishroon]I have checked in the code to CVS. Transfer doc: [^IS_PROGRAM_TRANSFER_FORM.doc]
