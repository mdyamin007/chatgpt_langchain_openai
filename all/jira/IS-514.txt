description: Turn on auto trigger from file scanner.

comment: [~andyp] [~Peter.Dang] Andy, per my spark message, I informed STAR that we would release this before EOM, specific to their EOM file. Can this be released tonight so that we can confirm if the file tomorrow morning processes as expected? I had DP disable the CRON already. The request was SPECIFIC for EOM processing because we were losing hours of processing due to the CRON being sent, but the DDA file arriving 2-4 hours prior. Please confirm ASAP, as I had conveyed that this would be released along with the other DDA updates.

I still cannot test this feature in parallel.

Could you check with ISD whether they had the inforeach API notification for our internal parallel FTP scanner. Thanks.

comment: [~phoebe.george]

I currently test this feature with the unit test and also with ISD enable.

I will provide update by 03/16.

Mack,

I did not see IS program receive the trigger notification to start program.

I will work with you directly to debug this issue.



For IS side only unit test, program did start correctly.

Attached the autoexec log as follow:
