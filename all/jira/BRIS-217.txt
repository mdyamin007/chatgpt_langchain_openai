comment: Usually in current production it's indication that the actual docket may not have been fully 'prepped'. May need PC to confirm.

comment: However, after clicking OK, it seems like the job was scanned into DataTrac. Can someone confirm if it was successful? It looks like the bridge is there as it generates the RTWO but the ETA board remains yellow which looks like it's still in progress.

comment: [~Terrence.Tong]: Can you review Neil's comment above? Is this something we can verify or do we need to get Mimi or PC involved?

comment: William,

Kent team did the installation (SocketActiveX.msi)  for 10.4.32.166. Ask them to do it for 10.4.20.128. And grant network access to 10.5.20.39 -> 3491
