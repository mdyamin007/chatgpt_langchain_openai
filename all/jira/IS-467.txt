title: ALCU - [22744][pvt] Update New Excite Logo on Mortgage Loan Bills
description: -------------------per Peter----------------------------

I found out the loan program is printing the log directly on. No need to have Wilson make create e-form. It is strange that the program is using e-form and also print the logo as well.

Loan applications:

Consumer Loan Statements (ML1),

LOC Loan Statements (ML2),

Mortgage Loan Statements (ML3) - 6 hours

Daily Notice: 3 hours.



Turnover to IS: 10/4/2021

Sample to client: 10/12/2021

Client approval: 10/14/2021

QA: 10/18/2021

Parallel: 10/20/2021
