comment: * Client OK to go live as is with the mobile Android issue but it will need to be addressed further after go live.
* We will go live posting full membership for eNotices but bill only for those enrolled. We will need to do a code update post live to post only enrolled members. This will be a separate ticket in Team Support.
* Client OK to go live knowing that any enrolled users missing emails will not get an email and will not have their print statements/notices suppressed, meaning, these enrolled members will get paper statements/notices. CU will do clean up post live to avoid this scenario in the future.

eStatements are approved with the exception of the banner distorted. Ethan is working to fix this.

eStatements moved to QA for all apps.
