Please remove "RE:" from the title box. client also sent a new file to the "test" folder .pgp encrypted thru the FTP secure transport. Can you please send a sample using this file for the DP_12ODN notice?

comment: Hi [~MattL],

We cannot find the new test file.

Can you please send the email of file arrival?

comment: Hi [~MattL],

I found the new test file.

And we need to do more programming update to accommodate that since their

data changed. I need to have another programming hour to do the update.

The new data file has 2 accounts.
the first account starts on position 5 which is correct,

but the second account starts on position 4, which means all the text shifted to left.

here the snap shot: !data_error.png!

comment: Hi [~zhuoxinT]



can you tell me what information is supposed to be in pos 4 & 5


author: JIRAUSER11101
comment: Hi [~MattL]

it supposed to have 1 more character at the beginning of each line.

it need to have 1 more space for each line at the beginning.

here's the first account snap shot: !account_1.png! 


author: mattl
comment: [~zhuoxinT], Client is requesting that we send them a sample using the first account anyway.
