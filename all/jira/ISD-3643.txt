comment: Thanks for the update, [~mamunur.rashid]. Were you able to test functionality by posting job on pui and have it visible on front end?

Code has been committed to i3-core dev and processing-ui dev.

PUI frontend code has been committed to/estmt2/processing/ui/trunk.

We have tested it on dev. Can you please test it on pilot?

Thanks.

comment: I also tested IDCU frontend using your code from/estmt2/idcu/trunk (*revision: 23902*)**. It was working fine. I don't know which verbiage should be shown in frontend according to isCorrection value so I didn't do anything on IDCU codebase.
