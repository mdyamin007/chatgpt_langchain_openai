title: WASH Special Handling Request
description: I am not sure if you are the correct avenue to answer this but I will start here



Karen Orrin at WASH has a large property management customer with numerous properties under their umbrella each with a separate account. The ownership of each account is the property management company and the primary owner of all accounts. The primary customer wants to receive their statements in electronic form. The sub property managers want to receive paper statements for their individual accounts.



The bank has been told that the delivery preference is only based on the primary account holders delivery preference. As this is one of the banks major clients is there a way to accommodate the delivery of paper to sub users while maintaining Electronic delivery to the parent company?



Please let me know
