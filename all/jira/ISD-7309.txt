I checked the pilot test folder but I don't see the file. Can you confirm whether I'm looking at the correct location? Attached is a screenshot.

comment: Hi [~Ricky Lopez],

Currently we are pending access on Sharepoint, so that, I do not have access on the SOW for this task.

In the meantime, I am continuing the setup with the following. Please correct me if anything needs changing:



Statement type: _escrow_

Statement desc:_Escrow Analysis Statement_

Statement prefix:_ml3_

Archival: _36 months_

Email notification:_Yes_

Approval Needed:_No_

Create Account if not found:_Yes_

comment: [~nischala.manjunath]

I've updated pilot for ea1 and posted the file (_ea1_20220302_1_20220718_1755_pfcu.txt)._The file posted without any error. The Escrow statements can be viewed from the admin site (infotrac).

Right now it is not possible to view those statements from client site as no user is being created with the process. We need to post a cif file.

Thanks

author: azad
comment: Thank you[~Shun.Kuwashima]. I copied the file to pilot for posting.

[~Ricky Lopez] I have run the cif file (_pfcu_cif_07052022_escrow_test.dly_) on p-ui pilot (jobId:188636). The file posted successfully.

As I did not find any account which have an Escrow Analysis statement on the cif file, I've added an extra line on the cif file to map a cif with an account for which an escrow analysis statement was posted before (_ea1_20220302_1_20220718_1755_pfcu.txt_).

So now you can view the Escrow statements from the client site by performing SSO with the cif number 186335 and the account is 79508. Our QA will start testing this on Pilot and also we are waiting for client approval for this on Pilot.

Could you clarify on the Escrow Analysis, we did load the escrow file?

Thanks

author: azad
comment: Hi[~Ricky Lopez],

Yes, we posted the escrow file on Pilot (jobid:188638).

Also, we are done testing the setup on Pilot. Here is the setup:
 * Statement prefix: ea1
 * Description (Statement name): Escrow Analysis Statements
 * Archival period: 36 months
 * Approval needed (needApproval): false
 * Email will be sent via API and no approval is needed for email template.

Please let me know the client's feedback on Pilot and also if above business are correct or any modification is needed.

[~Tin.Chak]fyi.

Thanks

comment: To QA,

Please test the Escrow statement setup on Stage. Also take a look on the SOW for the business confirmation. Current setup specifications are noted on the previous comment.

Please post the file (ea1_20220707_1_20220718_1755_pfcu.txt) on Stage environment (Document process) and check the database, admin site (infotrac) and client site. Run the job on test mode (Parallel Run) and via bypassing dt job id.

comment: Hi [~Ricky Lopez]

Can you tell me the "External Type" for application code EA? I am asking because, in the cif file, client provides us this external type and we map it to the appropriate application code. For example, 10 is the external type for "CK"; 51, 52 and 53 are the external types for "LN". Also, I did not find this external type code for EA in the SOW.

If I could know this external type value, I can add the mapping for EA on the database and then the statements should be categorized with application code EA.

[~Tin.Chak]Let me know if I understood Ricky's comment correctly. Also, right now PFCU does not have an account type of EA in the Infoconfig properties. For this setup, do you think we need to add this new type in infoconfig? Also PFCU uses "accountTypeSort" logic. So, if added, where will be the EA type go in the sorted list? Currently the list is sorted like this  ["CK","SV","LN","LC","CD","ER","ML","TX"].



Thanks!

author: azad
comment: [~Ricky Lopez]

I saw the comment from Dan.It seems that they want to introduce a new type "EA" and send "50" as the external type. Please correct me if I am wrong on this.

In the database, currently 50 is mapped with another internal type "ML". In the Processing UI, while processing cif file, current implementation of Processing UI does not support duplicate external type in the external-internal type mapping. i.e. we cannot have 50 mapped to "EA" as 50 is already mapped to "ML".

So, if PFCU wants a different "EA" type for Escrow statements, they need to provide us a different external type number that are not being used already. I am attaching a picture (pfcu_type_mapping.png) that will display the current external-internal type mapping for PFCU on our database.

[~Tin.Chak]please advice.

Thnaks,

author: phoebe.george
comment: [~Azad] We are still in pilot review with PFCU for their eEscrow Analysis setup.

Is it possible to clear out any account numbers in pilot that have an account type of 'LN' that had been created from the original index file from IS. This was a hard coded Account Type based on the original index file from Nischala/IS, but she updated to the correct account types in the last index file that was posted to pilot. Here is an example from the pilot query through InfoTrac:

comment: [~Tin.Chak] [~Ricky Lopez]

I've checked the issue that Dan Lazzaro stated on the team-support ticket.

I checked the log and found the request that got an error code 604 which made the sso request fail. The request did not contain the email and PFCU has sso.userUpdate flag true. If sso.userUpdate flag is true, then the sso request must contain an email value on the request payload. On the other hand, the request without Escrow accounts contains email, so it did not encounter any error.

I've tried doing sso using that payload with an email and didn't encounter any error and can see Escrow statements in Hypercube.

Let me know if any other issues occurs.

Thanks
Azhar

comment: Hi [~phoebe.george]

I have checked the issue that you mentioned in teamsupport ticket (comment #62) about PFCU couldn't do SSO to Hypercube pilot.

I've checked the Pilot server log of the time that client mentioned. I've found six sso attempts with cif number 183558. All of the request payloads are missing the email field value. I am giving the request payload here. All of the requests are of same payload.
{code:java}
{
    "gmt":"20220922143633",
    "user_fi_number":"183558",
    "email":"",
    "timeout":"10",

    "account_number3":"2020004822",
    "anum1":"0014869363^SV",
    "anum2":"0011194009^ND",
    "anum3":"2020004822^ML",

    "ausr3":"",
    "adsc1":"Savings",
    "adsc2":"Checking",
    "adsc3":"Fixed Rate Mortgage"
}
{code}
Also, I tried to do sso with the same payload containing email *test@infoimageinc.com*, and successfully logged into PFCU Hypercube site.

To do sso on Hypercube, you can use CIF num _100_.

comment: [~Azad] Andrey messaged me saying he did not receive any emails. I noticed that their stage conf file only has a few dsi emails on the email.allowedEmail configuration, you might need to add the infoimage domain or at least Andrey's email to that list before triggering emails. Can you take a look?

author: azad
comment: Thanks [~Shun.Kuwashima]. I did not add Andrey's email as it has an infoimageinc.com domain. From PUI side, this domain does not have any restriction while adding to the csv file and uploading it. From log, I found that Andrey's email is added to the csv file and uploaded successfully. I am going to look into it further and in the meantime, I am adding Andrey's email to allowed email list.

[~Andrey.Kutsenko], I am adding your email[andrey.kutsenko@infoimageinc.com|mailto:email%C2%A0andrey.kutsenko@infoimageinc.com]to allowed email list. Please try to re-trigger both the document posting job and email job and let me know if you get the email.
