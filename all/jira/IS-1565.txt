APCUDL015.zip is in qa folder.

There is simplex duplex issue. WIth production code APCUDL105.dfa that just got released yesterday , when it went through print dfa it looks like this:

!image-2022-09-09-00-34-24-508.png|width=625,height=628!



The first disclosure is appearing in 2nd logical page



!image-2022-09-09-00-35-38-476.png|width=655,height=578!



empty page as the front page.



We fixed the issue now.

If you want to check the print sample ( which I belive we don't have time, since production is holding ) here it is:[^apcudlc324.print]print range 1-19 from hvy file.
