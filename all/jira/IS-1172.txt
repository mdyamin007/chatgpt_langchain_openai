The samples - are ready for the client review 


author: dyuen
comment: Samples forwarded to client for review/approval.


author: dyuen
comment: [~anwarh], please see below feedback from MFCU:
 * Letter 108 - imported correctly with the correct Notice Date. This is approved.
 * Letters 145 and 146 - imported correctly but the Notice Dates were wrong; they were all dated 6/7. We need the Notice Date to be the date the notices would have printed. Can you please send new samples with the correct notice dates?

Please confirm once an updated archival sample for letters 145 and 146 are ready.

Thanks


author: dyuen
comment: [~anwarh], per our Zoom chat, I requested MFCU send a test file with the dates they want to see since the archive pulls the date from the data file. In the meantime, let's proceed with parallel for letter 108 since that is approved.

[~Igor.Khosid], FYI.

Thanks


author: anwarh
comment: [~dyuen], Please create a Parallel ticket for this, Thanks


author: dyuen
comment: [~anwarh], please generate a new sample set for the newest test file received. This is for letters 145 and 146 only.

Thanks

comment: Hi[~dyuen], do we have approval for this? Also the due date is missed, can you please provide a new live date? Thanks


author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~anwarh], no updates yet. I followed up with MFCU. I also updated the due date on the Jira to 6/30 for now.

Thanks


author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~anwarh], this is finally approved.

Per MFCU:

"I've confirmed that the archival files for letters 145 and 146 imported into our imaging system correctly.

Please proceed with QA and advise when we can start uploading the files for reprocessing.

Once we are live, I understand that we will upload the files inside outer files named as*mfcu_dl_mmddyyyy_5.zip.pgp*. Please confirm directory. (MFCU/dn?)"



Please provide IS checklist etc for QA and I will open a parallel ticket.

Thanks

comment: Hi [~anwarh], after code is released. We have MFCU's DLs since March 1st. DP confirmed this filemfcu_dl_03012022_1.zip.pgp

How are we going to reprocess these files just for letters 108, 145 and 146?

Thanks


author: anwarh
comment: Hi [~dyuen], I'll be reprocessing just these letters in parallel environment with a new segment 6. After that I'll ask DP to move them to client pickup. 
I'll let you know once I'm done. 

Thanks,
Anwar
