This is to suppress some account + name combination from account list.

The list is /z/download/bkpl/FBT_Authorized_signers.csv which is sent from the client. You can check in ts 33913 comments 29.

So now our task if we can find the match between data file and this account list with account+name combination we have to suppress those account from estatement.

The cycle in question is20220901 for which this update is needed. But this is a huge xml file AIP706INFSTM20220901064534.XML.PGP.

So I converted it to a bar delimited file first as we normally do in the script.

Then from there, I made a short data fileAIP706INFSTM20220901064534.XML.test.out that has 12 accounts.

Among those499162 account appears 7 times in data file:



[ronyD@dsi is-1640 Wed Sep 28 10:03]$ grep -i "^100.*499162" AIP706INFSTM20220901064534.XML.test.out
 100~`499162~`BANKRUPTCY CASE NO 20-10846~`216143.87~`252116.85~`1~`12~`N~`31~`D
 100~`499162~`JOHN CORB~`216143.87~`252116.85~`1~`12~`N~`31~`D
 100~`499162~`DEBTOR IN POSSESSION~`216143.87~`252116.85~`1~`12~`N~`31~`D
 100~`499162~`NICHOLAS NASH MARCHESE~`216143.87~`252116.85~`1~`12~`N~`31~`D
 100~`499162~`STEPHEN CHRISTOPHER RYAN~`216143.87~`252116.85~`1~`12~`N~`31~`D
 100~`499162~`FR JOHN SDB~`216143.87~`252116.85~`1~`12~`N~`31~`D
 100~`499162~`ARCHBISHOP SHAW HIGH SCHOOL~`216143.87~`252116.85~`1~`12~`N~`31~`D



And this account + name combination is found in the account list file:

!image-2022-09-28-23-07-48-535.png!

so in the E-statement index, there should not be an entry for these 4 account name combinations.

BKPLMS21.zip is in QA folder.

You can check /t/bkpl/bkplms2225.c1bmcok file which is paper txt file where there 12 account .Not sure if know about this file, if not that's ok. it's just to show you that 12 accounts were in the data file we processed and you will see 7 entries with account499162.

And now look at the estatement index file :

/t/isd_input/I3/process-files/bkpl/ms2_20220831_2_20220928_1036_bkpl.txt

You will see 8 entries and among these 3 entries are for account499162. So it rests 4 got suppressed.

You can also look at/t/bkpl/bkplms2225.print whre it says 4 accounts are in nonEstmt section.

/z/download/bkpl/is-1640 has data files if you want to look at these.

AIP706INFSTM20220901064534.XML is the decrypted data file forAIP706INFSTM20220901064534.XML.PGP. For this file this update will be run in production ultimately.

AIP706INFSTM20220901064534.XML.dat is bar delimited file for the xml file.

AIP706INFSTM20220901064534.XML.test.out is a short file made fromAIP706INFSTM20220901064534.XML.dat file that I mentioned which has 12 accounts and among them, 7 accounts are499162 with which I processed the updated dfa.



Development Id:20220928081517 (not parallel id parallel has another update going on)



There is also check image applicable but there is no update related to the check image and I didn't also parse the check images related to the data file which would take much time.



Let me know if you need anything else.

comment: Hi [~rony],: if we need to rollback the code, please provide rollback date in transfer form. So I can set the rollback date to alert on rollback date

Also, I believe your transfer form is not latest one that[~Peter.Dang]emailed recently. Because I don't see rollback date on transfer form.Can you please please fill up new one and let me know?

Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com], You need to give the roll back to Rony. So he can put in transfer form.

Thanks,

Hi [~rony]: Since you are not available. I am not waiting for new transfer form with rollback date. I just released with roll back date set to 10/03/2022. We should get email alert on that day. [~Peter.Dang]mentioned this morning that he will add DSI email to roll back alert too. But please set email reminder for yourself on that day too.

Thanks,
