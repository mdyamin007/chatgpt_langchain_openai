title: RHS:  /home/master Oracle Environment Variable Code Cleanup
description: I noticed the following codes are exporting the following environment variables and overloading/hardcoding the Oracle Path:



$TNS_ADMIN

$ORACLE_HOME



We should not overload the paths and should be defined in each users profile setting instead. Besides, the current paths defined in the linux user profile settings are+newer+ than what's overloaded in the code.



The following variable needs to be revisited:

$PATH

Please perform code review. Why do we need to overload the PATH system variable? I don't see any reason for it and I think it needs to be removed. Please review first to make sure my+opinion+ is correct.



Here's is a list of all the codes that references the scenarios above:

The are the program files from the list above:


{noformat}
/home/master/fcsb_daily_process.sh
/home/master/fcsb_dda_process_rh2.sh
/home/master/fcsb_saving_process_rh2.sh
/home/master/keys_process_tt.sh
/home/master/psfa_process.sh
/home/master/psfa_process_test.sh
/home/master/psfa_usps_process.sh
/home/master/psfa_usps_process_test.sh{noformat}
Of all the code above, I+think+ only the fcsb code is being used. Ideally if we had the other CVS check-in/out program completed to perform deletes, you can just delete the unused code w/o needing to clean it up.



When project is done, I will run the following linux command to confirm that there is no more references to what is identified above:
{noformat}
grep -irH 'oracle' /home/master/* | grep -v DBI | grep 'export'{noformat}

comment: we don't need to export the oracle path. The scripts that has these path export are no longer used.

comment: Let's get the CVS check in/out program project worked on so that we can delete this code that is no longer used from our repository.
