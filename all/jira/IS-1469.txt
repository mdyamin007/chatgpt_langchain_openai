title: EQBK - Account Analysis PDFi Conversion to AFP2PDF Python [InHse]
description: Update existing processing script to no longer use PDFi tool to create pdf.
 Instead use afp2pdf.py program with index_build_multicore option for ALL statement related apps.
 The smaller daily notice jobs can use the current index_build options.

All the zip file, pgp encryption, index file contents, and PDF file naming convention must remain exactly the same original specifications.

Please ensure the standard SOP on the directory structure must be followed: 
 ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/pdf, ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/zip, ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/work is followed.
 Also, clear the folder directory folder before each processing. We do NOT want to accumulate previous runs.

The current program should support checking total PDF counts verification to make sure the expected pdf matches the total number for pdfs generated; If not, incorporate this standard verification logic

DT_JOB_ID:

Processing Scripts to modify:
 /home/master/eqbkma1_process.sh

Data Files to use:



*NOTE*: This job runs on RH2. Since we are migrating from RHS to RH2, we should test all options so that we can do afpcompare and also ensure there is no errors in the processing logs.



*Additional Note:*

Looks like the DFA code is invoking PDFi generation if my research is correct.

Parallel ID: 20220925183208
 production cycle: 09/10

Data files:
 /z/dsi_pdfi_testing/eqbkma1/data/EQBK_AA_09102022.txt

old zips: /z/dsi_pdfi_testing/eqbkma1/old/
 new zips: /z/dsi_pdfi_testing/eqbkma1/new/

Notes:
 * You'll see a known issue where afp2pdf removes ',' from the index file
 * Also, you will see a 1 file difference, that's because the old script also zipped two additional files HOLD_mail...pdf and Invalid_address...pdf (If anyone exists). According to SOW script should directly copy to the client pickup, which it does. But there is nothing mentioned to put them also in the archive zip. I think this is kind of a bug. 

Thanks,
 Anwar

comment: [~anwarh]: Thanks for confirm where the issue lies with the afp2pdf.py global bug that just deletes ',' characters. Since this is a global bug and pre-existing, I will need to revisit with the team to pursue a longer term fix. I don't think this global bug should prevent us from continuing with this project.



As for issue #2, let's keep theEQBK_AA_HoldMail_09102022.pdf file in the zip so that we do not eliminate this existing behavior. If SOW did not tell us whether or not to keep theEQBK_AA_HoldMail_09102022.pdf file and we are currently doing so, let's retain this logic for now. Can the script be updated to include it? Will it cause any check & balancing issue if it include the hold file?



Please advise tomorrow when time permits. For now, i will change the status to "In Progress" until I get confirmation on issue #2 is adjusted.

comment: Per discussing with [~anwarh] , yes, it is possible to still include theEQBK_AA_HoldMail_<MMDDYYYY>.pdf; However, the current script uses preprocessing02 old afp2web client to convert the pdf. It is agreed to switch to the standard afp2pdf.py python direct call version. The agreement is to not use the custom /home/keep/eqbkma1.ini, but the /home/afp2web/afp2web.ini standard. But, please pass the custom parameter PDFSecurity=',83vTE1vG,128,0';

Can you please move them into /d/is/cvs/xfer/anwarH/ and then release?

Thanks,

Seems like I placed the files in "IS-1469" instead of 'is-1469'.
Please check again in here:/d/is/cvs/xfer/anwarH_backup/is-1469
Thanks
