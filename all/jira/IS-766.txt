title: PFCU - [23002][pvt] HELOC Previous Balance line is missing on some accounts
description: IS Assessment
=============
Hours for development: 3 IS hours + 0 ISD hours
Turnover Date : 01/28/2022
Sample date: 02/03/2022
Sample Approval Date:  02/07/2022
Go live date : 02/09/2022

Assessment Details (IS):
- Parallel required: no

- Assessed by Anwar

- When "Previous Balance" is not present as a transaction we should display "Previous Balance" as a hard coded description and use R:22 C:73-78(previous statement date) formatted like the other dates in the transaction section and use R:22 C:79-92 as the amount.

- This way we will always have a previous balance line to display.
