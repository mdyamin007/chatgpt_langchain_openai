comment: I checked against Jenkins, "uccu-03242017-changes" tag is what is currently deployed onto production.

If they're already on InfoTrac, there's not much you'll need to do there. We just need to make sure the PUI processes are all working with the new data structure (NP emails, etc) so that the API will work.

We need to support both their current existing member site along with the API for a short while

As i have facing issue that , there is no flag like  "etax.checksum.bypass" when i try to process etax. i am strucking in Worker.java which searching that flag. I have also see that there is no process step for paperless.I am using PUI/conf/uccu.conf  of trunk.
