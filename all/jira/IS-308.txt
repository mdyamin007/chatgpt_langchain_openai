Can you please the original file for 8-9-2021 for comparison?

Keri,

Data file used to generated samples is attached.

Thanks.


author: william.kong
comment: Hi [~kdishroon],

I understand that Le submitted samples yesterday. Do you think we can get client approval today so that we can meet the live date on Monday, August 16, 2021. I'm thinking we may need to do a rush parallel as well even though it was not noted on this ticket. Would it be an issue if we are a day or two late depending on when we get approval and finish parallel.

author: william.kong
comment: [~kdishroon]: Per my understanding from your discussion with Le, we are still pending signed work order.



The timeline for this project is not valid. We will need to revisit a new timeline based upon our availability once we hear back from client.

I just put in a date; it can be revised when we received a signed work order.

please advise: print samples dl008 shows "return notice" instead ofunavailable/insufficient funds notice, per SOW DL008 should beunavailable/insufficient funds notice. please request correct samples + endorsement is missing.

[~kdishroon]- do you have approved samples? or pdf samples?

author: kdishroon
comment: Hi [~berezinez] - The 3114 should be return notices; 3112 and 3113 are Unavailable / Insufficient Funds notices:

comment: [~berezinez]

There are 3 types of report for letter 008.

Keri in SOW dl008 should appear:

1.UNAVAILABLE/INSUFFICIENT FUNDS NOTICE
 2.UNAVAILABLE FUNDS OVERDRAFT NOTICE

comment: [~lemoy28] I saw the parallel ticket assigned to me, are there any resources I need to upload?


author: william.kong
comment: [~kdishroon]: Can you confirm if the logic needs to be released today so that it can be applied to Monday morning's processing? If it is for Monday, I need [~lemoy28]to release the code today. But if it is for Tuesday's cycle, then [~TunA]will need to help [~lemoy28]release the code Monday. Please advise at your earliest convenience.



BTW, we are still waiting for [~Shun.Kuwashima]to confirm the parallel process is done per comment above.

Also, pending OPS parallel results from David O.




author: william.kong
comment: [~kdishroon]: Per our conversation just now. Code release date: Mid-day Tuesday. The new logic will be applied to Wednesday's processing at 6:40am PST. I will update the due date now.



[~lemoy28]/[~TunA]: fyi.


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~kdishroon] [~William.Kong] I just confirmed with Le, there are actually no enotices for ewbb, therefore I don't think ISD needs to be involved at all. 


author: kdishroon
comment: [~lemoy28] - Please release code.
