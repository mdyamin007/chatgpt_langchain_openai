Update paperless file name to: idcu_paperless.Month-Day-YYYY.txt

Adding this update from IS-1112 to combine with this release:

Request from customer to update/fix:

_When uploading the archives to onBase they came across a naming error that was causing some issues. They think it was caused by some of the issues they had with the file on Friday. They also say it wasnt hard to adjust the number and the files loaded correctly but CU wanted to make sure that this was not going to be an issue on future runs._

_NOTE: In response to the file name between 200 and 201. The name doesnt matter so much as that the Index file was different from the actual file names. The way the onBase ingests the ARMS is it uses the Index file to fill in the prompts. Where the Index file said 200 then the file names said 201. We just need the file name to match what is in the index file._
