 Did you receive the new test data file that was requested to include more than one account for the Notice 124/S-1724 notice?


author: JIRAUSER11300
comment: Hi [~Natalie.Tom],
Yes. Please find in the attachments to this Story for the new notice and let us know if any questions

Thank you!

comment: Hi [~Juliana Vannik]

The attached 125 information is on the wrong story. I'm asking about the notice 124.


author: JIRAUSER11300
comment: Sorry, [~Natalie.Tom], that was for the different notice. We requested a follow-up with the CU for the new test file and will attach once received.

Project files:
W:\qa\SSCU\SSCUDL100.zip
W:\qa\SSCU\SSCUDL124.zip

As a new data file wasn't provided for notice 124, the sample was created with the test data file (in TS 28120, comment 3) - PS-HLOC-SCHMC.STM
I also wanted to note that the test data file, PS-HLOC-SCHMC.STM, doesn't include the parameter, "Formatted Notice Date | " as seen in the data for other letters so the date above the address was used. Also I wanted to clarify if the data file will also have the member name with a period in between the first and last name as shown in the data file as: "Member Name | Aaron . Smith" because currently the code removes the period and displays the first and last name based on the mapping at "Dear First_Name_0Last_Name_1"

comment: [~Andrey.Kutsenko] - please review and submit for the client's approval
Please let me know if you have any questions

[~Juliana Vannik] [~Natalie.Tom] -  Information for the development and testing provided in a few different sources would be possible to consolidate in the epic or the story; this will expedite the testing process.
Also, I will send the meeting invite if needed.

comment: Hi [~Natalie.Tom], 
Thank you for the samples and comments! I will verify with the customer and get back as soon as receive any update


author: JIRAUSER11300
comment: [~Natalie.Tom],

Please see the customer comments below:
1. For SSCUDL100 (S-61), can we please have a minor edit to the last sentence? Please update "Live Help" to "Live Chat".
2. For SSCUDL124, can we have the date be written ex. June 7, 2022? The Member name won't come through with a period must have been that one account.

I hope that makes sense. Please let me know if you need additional clarification
Thank you!
Juliana

comment: [~Juliana Vannik] 
For SSCUDL124, usually in order for the date to be displayed as 'month day, year', the data file would contain that information underthe parameter, "Formatted Notice Date | ". Is that data going to be provided in data file, PS-HLOC-SCHMC.STM? The date on the sample was obtained from the data file, shown as 03-15-2022.


author: JIRAUSER11300
comment: [~Natalie.Tom],

The customer has just confirmed that they have added the "Formatted Notice Date" to the file and it should come over now.

Thank you!

What's the file name of the data they're sending over?


author: JIRAUSER11300
comment: Hi [~Natalie.Tom],
It should be PS-HLOC-SCHMC_MMDDYY.STM
Please let me know if any other questions

Thank you!

author: JIRAUSER11300
comment: Hi [~Natalie.Tom],

Could you please have a look if we can mirror the other notices in order to solve this issue:
The added parameter 'Formatted Notice Date' in the data file has 'Formatted Notice Date | 06-08-2022' instead of 'Formatted Notice Date | June 8, 2022' - the client double-checked the marker and it's using the same field as the other notices. They are not sure why it's not showing it as a month and thinking it's a bug in the program. Ideally, they would like it to display as June 8, 2022.

Thank you,
Juliana


author: JIRAUSER11103
comment: [~Juliana Vannik] 
 In order to ensure that the date will display as June 8, 2022, can I request that they add another parameter/field that they also have on data files for other letters. They have a 'Notice Date |" parameter for example, 'Notice Date | 06-08-2022'.

comment: [~Juliana Vannik]
Are there any updates on the updated data file for letter 124?


author: JIRAUSER11300
comment: Hi [~Natalie.Tom],
Thank you for checking! We are still waiting for the customer to provide the requested. I have just sent him a reminder

Customer has just confirmed that he added file in /test directory with new data marker. Can you please check if you see it, or do you need the name of the file?

Thank you,

 I just wanted to note that since the letters are still being approved and we still need to go through parallel, that the live date, 6/16, may not be met.
