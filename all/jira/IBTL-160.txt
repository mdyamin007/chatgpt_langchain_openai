comment: [~davidt]:  We have issue. This url is still pointing to Menlo. What is the brisbane IP address so that we can either JAIL the DNS or update the /etc/hosts file.

On Menlo, I can update the code to use [notifyservice-common.infoimageinc.com|http://notifyservice-common.infoimageinc.com/]instead ofinfocloud01.infoimageinc.com.  

On Menlo, i will update the /etc/hosts file to reference[notifyservice-common.infoimageinc.com|http://notifyservice-common.infoimageinc.com/]to point to 10.8.9.55

After above two steps are completed, we we sync code to Brisbane; We do not have to modify /etc/hosts since[notifyservice-common.infoimageinc.com|http://notifyservice-common.infoimageinc.com/]points to IP address of10.4.16.91

Can you see what we can do on Menlo Site to use port 80. William mention that Anil did similar thing on the index file processing

comment: Will,

    OnMenlo, you call the direct tomcat url for notifyservice that uses port. On Brisbane you need to call proxy url which is without port. Also on Brisabane there is no context path(/notifyservice) in the proxy url

For e.g : On Menlo : [http://infocloud01.infoimageinc.com:8080/notifyservice/]



The Brisbane equivalent of this url is : [https://notifyservice-common.infoimageinc.com/](OR)[http://notifyservice-common.infoimageinc.com/]



Notice that there is no port number in the url, also the /notifyservice has been removed from the context path in the proxy url


I recommend using proxy url, because of one node goes down we will have a failover node . But if you plan to keep the configs same in both Menlo and Brisbane then you can use any of the below port url for notifyservice on Brisbane


[http://ca-infotrac-pr-01.infoimageinc.com:8080/notifyservice/]

[http://ca-infotrac-pr-02.infoimageinc.com:8080/notifyservice/]



Thanks,

Surekha Dani

comment: [~Peter.Dang]: Please update the code in Menlo to use:



[http://ca-infotrac-pr-01.infoimageinc.com:8080/notifyservice|http://ca-infotrac-pr-01.infoimageinc.com:8080/notifyservice/]



Please remember to keep port 8080.

I've updated Menlo rhs, rhs2, rh2, rht, pp03 & pp02 /etc/hosts file:
