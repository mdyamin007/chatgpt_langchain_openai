I have edited the Wiki page. Please let me know if you have any question. There are also some development that will need to be done. However, the testing should take priority.

We've tried with blazemeter and Jmeter to test the sso load, but from resindev, when the key is being generated, these tools couldn't read and set the key. That's why we went on a different approach after discussing with Joe, which is to print milliseconds before loading the accounts from backend , and print again after loading to measure the time it takes to load all the accounts. We've printed some lines in ssoOptOutAll.jsp but unfortunately we are not able to see the logs of pilot from today. We've processed some auth files in pilot-pui containing 100,200...1000 accounts to measure how much time it takes to load those accounts depending on their count. Following are the CIFs for those users -

1010001 - 100 accounts

1020001 - 200 accounts

1030001 -300 accounts

1040001 -400 accounts

1050001 -500 accounts

1060001 -600 accounts

1070001 -700 accounts

1080001 -800 accounts

1090001 -900 accounts

1110001 -1000 accounts

I have a rough estimate about the time it takes to load accounts based on their count. Following are the results -



1000 accounts - 1.38.57 mins

900 accounts - 1.20.01 mins

800 accounts - 1.13.47 mins

700 accounts - 58.84 secs

600 accounts - 47.57 secs

500 accounts - 39.58 secs

400 accounts - 32.28 secs

300 accounts - 24.68 secs

200 accounts - 16.99 secs

100 accounts - 8.42 secs



These results won't vary if we change the page Length for a large number of accounts as we are loading all the accounts at once from backend.
