comment: [~dawnl] Per Tun's comment 48 and my initial research, TFCU does not have estatements/enotices, therefore I think this is print only. There is no updates/testing required from ISD, so we can close this ISD story.

comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima]- per Tun's assessment, there are 2 ISD hours to add to eside and test. See the description. Please double check.

comment: [~dawnl] Sorry, I forgot to provide the ticket number in my previous comment. If you look at ticket 28801 comment 48, Tun mentions "Paper ONLY (no enotice or archival)". Also the description in this story says the same thing. TFCU does not seem to be an estatement client, which is why I believe it should be just paper. Can you double check? Thanks
