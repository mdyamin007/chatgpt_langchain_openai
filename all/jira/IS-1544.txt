Rony, client responded to the samples:

Per my communications team, they are concerned that this not the correct font.

"It looks like they are using Times New Roman as the font. We updated to a sans serif font when we went through the brand articulation back in 2014 and we have been trying to update all our Member communications accordingly as they come up for review/refresh. Our preference is Calibri, but Arial will also work if needed. "

Can you verify what font is being used?


author: rony
comment: Hi [~billr]

We updated in production code. We just changed some text and didn't change anything about the font. And current production code is using Times New Roman, so I am not sure how the client is saying they updated the font to sans serif. If a client wants to do a font change then we can use Arial but it should be a separate programming request and billable.



Thanks

comment: Note: I looked back at an old cycle and this letter was originally set up with Times New Roman. Refer to the sample attached in comment 28 on ticket #31411. I am confirming with RWCU if they want to proceed with the font update. If they do, then I will bill accordingly. Rony quoted an extra 2 hours per ticket #33044/33058

Thanks

comment: Hi [~rony], is Calibri a font option for this letter?

Here for the marked part, we are using arial as before, but for the rest, we are using calibri , and the acrobat reader is not showing any font for that.



Thanks.

comment: Hi [~rony], this is approved!

Per RWCU: "These have been approved with the fonts as indicated. Please release."

I re-attached the sample for confirmation/clarification.

I got error when I was releasing for/d/is/cvs/xfer/rumanB/S1RWCUF1.300. Please check with [~rony].

If you never check out any PSEG before, please check out one PSEG first and check in again. IF you did, I am not sure why. Check with Rony and Peter for assistance.

Zoom message me, if you want me to try again.

Thanks,
