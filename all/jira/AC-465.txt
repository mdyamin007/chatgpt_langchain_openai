Last years index files came with the account numbers. However, this years have the member numbers instead, which is good, but are you able to have them include the account numbers as well?

We actually want both in the file if possible, but if not then we prefer the account number to be included so we can pull the member number ourselves. Please let me know as soon as you can.

Yes, we could add the account number to the archival index and the member number. Please ask the client to provide an updated format for the archival index with both the account number and member number.

It will be 2 program hours. Please open a story if the client confirms the change.
