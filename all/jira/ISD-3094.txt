title: 13197 - ASFC - Update Profile Page to allow User to change Paperless Status to Paper
description: None

comment: Hi [~tai.trinh],

where should I redirect a SSO user after changing the paperless status to paper? For DSO user it's logged out and redirected to the login page. But I'm not sure what should be the behave for SSO users since we do not have any login page for them.

Thanks,

Abdullah

They get signed out and that's it. They will have to re-login with the original login method that's managed by the third party. There should be an ssoSignout page.

Thanks,
Tai

Did you commit to pd-tools? I do not think the commit was synced over to the brisbane svn instance. The last commits I see are for the DSO Enrollment. Please re-commit.

Thanks,
Tai
