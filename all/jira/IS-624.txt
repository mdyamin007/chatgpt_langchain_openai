comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com], can you please confirm how the data files are coming over for the new letters? Are they going to be included in the zip file with the other data files or separate? Just want to know whether I need to update the script before submitting to QA. Thanks!


author: william.kong
comment: [~shailendrar]/[~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]: Can you guys please answer [~nischala.manjunath]'s question above so that we can wrap up this spec above?


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~nischala.manjunath]- they will not be sending in the zip. They will send individually.

Credit Plus =BKPL_CreditPlusCollectionLetter_<MMDDYY>.<HHMM>.csv

ILS Outsourced =BKPL_ILS-Outsourced-Mail_<MMDDYY>..csv

Military Loan =BKPL_Military_<MMDDYY>.csv

Welcome Letter =BKPL_Welcome_<MMDDYY>.csv


author: nischala.manjunath
comment: Thanks [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com], I'll update the script to reflect that. We'll need to receive these files at the same time as the zip file to ensure they are picked up by the script to be processed.
