comment: [~hesham.hanna]: Please re-assign back to me when done; Since this is development box, you can start clone at anytime. You don't need to inform anyone when to start cloning.

comment: [~hesham.hanna]: Can you update the DNS to reference ca-isis-dv-01 to 10.4.18.39? Once updated, please change red font too black.  If Prem takes care of this, can you please re-assign this ticket to him:

comment: [~premraj.patil]: One more note, the hostname -i is still pointing to IP address 10.8.9.71 instead of 10.4.18.39:

Can you log into ca-isis-pr-01, ca-isis-pr-02, and/or ca-isis-pr-03 to test it out? I'm not able to get it to work there.



Here's my test case:
