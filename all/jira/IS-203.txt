I just put note inJEF# 47852 to Tohidul (DSI) to add their code in your code in parallel. Can you please review tomorrow morning, if Tohidul added or not?

comment: Hi [~tohidulI] [~TunA] [~rony] [~William.Kong] ,

I copied the updated DFA and loadeddata file attached on JEF 47852 comment 45 "325180113.20210611.LOANXT.100.XML.zip" to my Papyrus locally. I am getting undeclared variable used for "PRINCIPAL", "INTEREST" and "OTHER" variables for some accounts. The first occurrence is the 16th account. Will this be an issue for production?
