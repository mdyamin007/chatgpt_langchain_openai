title: Hypercube - Remove dependency of acctNumberMaskingflag  on visibleLengthOfMaskedAccount flag value
description: Currently, the*acctNumberMaskingflag*flag feature is dependent on*visibleLengthOfMaskedAccount*value. If*visibleLengthOfMaskedAccount*flag is not defined then*acctNumberMaskingflag*feature does not work. But We can remove dependency from this flag by assume*visibleLengthOfMaskedAccount*value as "4" if this flag is not defined in the client properties file.
