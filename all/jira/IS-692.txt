description: ops want the account appears in increasing order per page counts meaning customers with smaller pages will appear first .

For example: if you see wecums1130.c1bmcok.prod (which is from production) in[^wecums1130.c1bmcok.prod.zip]you will see group image(335-339) is not quite appearing in increasing order.



!image-2021-12-24-02-15-50-338.png!



now after updating when I ran in parallel , if you seewecums1130.c1bmcok.par in[^wecums1130.c1bmcok.par.zip]file now this is appearing in increasing order:



!image-2021-12-24-02-17-20-516.png!



so the update was to sort the accounts appearing in the print files in increasing order per group image. If you also notice this sorting didn't mess up any householding entry meaning:

for example*ALICE MAYO FOR EVIN EVERETT*is householded ( there are 2 entries in c1bmcok file with this name ).

How do you know householder from c1bmcok file ?

if you see 0 in column 334 after this row up to the first row which have 1 in 334 column are householder.

!image-2021-12-24-02-23-34-243.png!

per this snapshot line 75626 and 75627 are householder. Another example:

!image-2021-12-24-02-25-27-811.png!

line 84906 to 84911 those accounts are householder. Householding criteria was by name and address.



so after sorting we needed to confirm that householding still intact. So if you can any customer in the parallel c1bmcok file is householder you will this customer is also householder in prod c1bmcok file.



You can call me in zoom if you need any help.



Thanks
