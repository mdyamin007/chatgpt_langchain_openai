comment: Hi [~thomasY],



Are we still tracking for samples on 2/17. [~mac]is requesting the index file on ISD-5862


author: thomasy
comment: [~MattL]Yes it is still being worked on.


author: thomasy
comment: [~MattL]Please provide the pdf archival specs for this new letter and update the SoW with it as well.


author: mattl
comment: Hi [~thomasY]



please see link to updated SOW.



archival specs should follow all other WHCU DN.


author: thomasy
comment: [~MattL]There are multiple archival specs depending on the letter that all have different content if you look above the letter matrix. I need to know which one to use or if it will be another new format.


author: thomasy
comment: Attaching samples for now but I still need the archival index specs.

comment: Hi [~thomasY] [~William.Kong]


Finally heard back from the client. We will have archival information & sample approval by Friday March 4th COB.



Please provide timeline based on approval on Friday.

author: william.kong
comment: [~MattL]: Sample approval date needs to be revisited after we get the specification on the index file on Friday. So next Monday/Tuesday, we can discuss new sample approval date and proposed live date for this project.






author: mattl
comment: [~William.Kong]we already have samples. are we talking archival sample?




author: william.kong
comment: [~MattL]: If I read Thomas's comments above, we are pending the index file specifications. If we are pending index file specifications, that means client needs to test the index file along with the PDF files together. Not separately.

[~thomasY]: Is my understanding correct, you are still pending the PDF archival index specifications? If so, once you get the specifications and finish the coding, please provide+both+ the index file and PDFs to make sure they are working ad packaged correctly. I don't want to give clients bits and pieces to review and approve.


author: william.kong
comment: [~MattL]: Any updates on my comments above? Please advise. Thomas confirmed he is still waiting for the index file specs.


author: mattl
comment: They said they would have that by friday
