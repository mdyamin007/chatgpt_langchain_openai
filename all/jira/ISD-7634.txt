Sorry to ask but would you please try to post the index filewtcu_968192_afp_enotice_05242022.txt to pilot? [~gthillaivel]tried but has dt job id null issue. But, I am not quite sure why. Would it be possible for you to investigate? We re using dt job id136725-C05.01-V20528 for pilot.

comment: [~rony] I believe it depends on whether estatement tracking is enabled, otherwise our process will not fetch the dtjobid from the print database. ISD does not control estatement tracking though, please double check on your end.
