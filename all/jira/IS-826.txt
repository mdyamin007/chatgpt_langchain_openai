After row 409


 * Update checksum log to included zip filename first before showing checksum for individual data files.
 * Update themfcudla_create_std_letters.py regular expression to be more strict with the file naming conventions. Refer to SOW for the latest filenaming convention.
 * Update processing script to concatenatemfcu_ATMNetworkNotices_[0-9]+_MMDDYYYY_[0-9]+ & mfcu_ATMNetworkNotices_MMDDYYYY_[0-9]+ and eliminate the temporarily seg #3 logic.
 * Update processing script to move notices out of the /d/ftpbu/mfcubu/dn/ folder; DP noticed the processed data file was still present in this folder.
 * Update the processing script to take in segment number as a parameter. Please keep the seg #1 & seg #2 business logic within the script. Script should also be able to handle seg #3 and above to process any notice files even if the data file is NSF. Seg #3 and above give DP and customer to send additional files if they do not include in Seg #1 and Seg#2.
 * Update mfcu_AUDIOACCESS_mmddyyyy_seg#.zip.pgp &mfcu_PRIVACYOPTOUT_mmddyyyy_seg#.zip.pgp to use zip file naming convention.

In addition, Neil @ DP informed me that/home/keep/cksum_log/gecu_dl_cksum.log is a+better+ layout for the checksum logic. It would be ideal if you can follow that model
