title: 19140 - GCBK - Enable Account Nicknames And Process from Auth File
description: * Update SSO to use primaryCIF|secondaryCIF format. This update is already on Pilot for the API project. However, we can release this early.
 * Process nicknames from auth file (Bank Number|CIF Number|Customer Type|First Name|Last Name|Application Type|Account Number{color:#ffab00}|{color}{color:#00875a}*Account Nickname*{color}|Account Active Status|Date Closed|Employee Code|Maintenance Code|Email )
 * Propagate nickname to all children CIF (since the CIF file only contains primary CIF)
 * Make sure children nicknames are also deleted when the children CIF are deleted (and also when the parent CIF is deleted)
 * Run data migration script on usr_mapping table
 * Update Admin & Client Site code to display nickname
