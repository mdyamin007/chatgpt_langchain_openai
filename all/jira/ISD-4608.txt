title: 48438 - IDCU - Validate comm loan paperless file postings
description: Mostly IS update, will probably need to help verify paperless file posting and delivery preference updates.


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: IS sending paperless files with prefix c11 (c-one-one) rather than cl1 (c-L-one), pending response from Nar.

comment: Setting prefix c11 (c-one-one) in conf file works, paperless table is now properly updating. May remove this if Nar can change the paperless file prefix to CL1.
