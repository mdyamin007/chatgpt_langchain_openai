comment: QA: JUST A HEADS UP, I ASSUMED THERE WOULD BE NO NEED FOR SAMPLES SINCE THIS WAS A SCRIPTING CHANGE TO PICKUP A NEW XREF FILE FOR THE ADDRESS DEPT CODE. I WAS WRONG IN MY ASSUMPTION AND THEY INDEED WANTED SOME SAMPLES. IN ORDER TO GIVE SAMPLES IN TIME, I BYPASSED QA REVIEW AND GAVE THEM TO CLIENT. I HAVE NOT SET UP A PARALLEL YET BECAUSE THE SCRIPT IS CURRENTLY IN ANOTHER PARALLEL FOR IS-Jira 335 WHIICH GOES LIVE ON 1/31. AFTER THAT GOES LIVE I WILL CREATE A NEW PARALLEL AND POST HERE. IN THE MEANTIME, BELOW ARE THE PRJ FILES AND SAMPLES I FORWARDED TO CLIENT.

comment: [~rodriguez]Thanks forOld afp files.

Output forms generated by Old and New afp files look the same.


author: rodriguez
comment: [~Andrey.Kutsenko]Yes that is correct, we want it to look the same since no cosmetic change was made to statements, all we need to verify is that there is a dept code number after the first line in the address. This number is pulled from the xref file.
