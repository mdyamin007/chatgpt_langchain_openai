Samples are approved by client.

comment: [~Kbittmann]/[~Igor.Khosid]Here is the checklist. As said we will bypass parallel for this as we do not have time for parallel. Will release tomorrow after production is done for 7/1 process.



[~rony]: I will release the merged code of yours and mine to production tomorrow. Will update your Jira as well once done.
