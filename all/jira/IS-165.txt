comment: [~billr]: According to Hosein the client took a while to approve. I'm assuming client missed the sample approval date of 6/25. Can you advise when customer approved the samples?



[~hkhosravani]/[~Peter.Dang]: Please advise ETA on the next steps. Is this going to QA to check the shifting? Please advise the next steps so that Bill can communicate accordingly.
