title: Logstash detect mongo error and reconnect
description: # Start logstash with a Mongo output plugin
 # Write something to logstash --> Data is stored to Mongo
 # Shutdown Mongo (I run Mongo as Service in Windows, so I stop Mongo service)
 # Write something to logstash
 # I get error: Failed to send event to MongoDB {:event=>2017-03-08T08:48:00.057Z _________ t4, :exception=>#<Mongo::Error::NoServerAvailable: No server is available matching preference: #<Mongo::ServerSelector::Primary:0x7354 @tag_sets=[],[@options|https://github.com/options]=:database=>"admin"},@server_selection_timeout=30>>,

comment: There are couple of open issues in the*logstash-plugins/logstash-output-mongodb*repository for this mongo reconnection
 * [https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-output-mongodb/issues/53]
 * [https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-output-mongodb/issues/38]

The current logstash doesn't support this *yet*. but the issues are labeled with *enhancement* flag.

But there is a separate git repository by a user that we need to look at. I don't understand ruby code. so, need to check carefully by someone else.

The repo url is: [https://github.com/username1366/logstash-output-mongodb]
