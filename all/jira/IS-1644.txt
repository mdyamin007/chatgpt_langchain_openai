Looking at the SOW, there are a few issues, please address and update the SOW.
1. In the business rules one line starts with "Should we include 4 images..", what does that mean? The pdf file, W8 and W9.pdf,mentioned has 18 pages or 9 pages double sided as mentioned in the next line
Screenshot of issue: !SOW_Issue1.PNG|thumbnail!
2. Below issue #1, there's a table with an xml file, but it wasn't mentioned in this jira's description. What is it for or is it supposed to be removed?
Screenshot of issue: !SOW_Issue2.PNG|thumbnail!
3. In the printing and mailing section, the table has page 1 stmt as duplex when it should be simplex. It alsohas the issue with the #10 envelope, which will be mentioned in issue 4.
Screenshot of issue: !SOW_Issue3.PNG|thumbnail!
4. For the envelope number issue, the SOW says that it's 4401 house envelope, but this will have 10 pages so it won't fit, what's the code for the bi-fold envelope?
Screenshot of issue: !SOW_Issue4.PNG|thumbnail!
5. In the file naming conventions, for the file destination where is the file going to be dropped? Will the data file be sent outside the oscu folder or to the oscu tax folder?

{color:#4C9AFF}-Please ignore. I have made corrections and deleted the confusing verbiage.

2. Below issue #1, there's a table with an xml file, but it wasn't mentioned in this jira's description. What is it for or is it supposed to be removed?
{color:#4C9AFF}-This is just for internal information. You can ignore this.{color}

3. In the printing and mailing section, the table has page 1 stmt as duplex when it should be simplex. It also has the issue with the #10 envelope, which will be mentioned in issue 4.
{color:#4C9AFF}-This has been corrected {color}

4. For the envelope number issue, the SOW says that it's 4401 house envelope, but this will have 10 pages so it won't fit, what's the code for the bi-fold envelope?
{color:#4C9AFF}- I will get back to you on this{color}

5. In the file naming conventions, for the file destination where is the file going to be dropped? Will the data file be sent outside the  OSCU folder or to the OSCU tax folder?
-{color:#4C9AFF} The file will be placed in OSCU main folder. Since it is an annual job, hopefully it will not be an issue. {color}

OSCU wants to switch to a format that supports a 6x9 letter. Can you please advise what changes are needed from OSCU?

Thanks, Barnett


author: JIRAUSER11103
comment: [~barnetts] 
Please provide the envelope code for the 6x9 envelope. There aren't any additional changes needed from OSCU if the envelope is our internal envelope.


author: JIRAUSER11103
comment: [~barnetts]
Can you provide the envelope code for the 6x9 envelope?


author: barnetts
comment: Hi [~Natalie.Tom],

The stock code is 5333.

Thanks, Barnett 


author: JIRAUSER11103
comment: [~barnetts] 
Is this the correct code? Stock code is usually referred to paper code not the envelope code. Otherwise, is this a custom envelope? If it is, then I'llneed the measurement for the envelope windows


author: barnetts
comment: HI [~Natalie.Tom],

It is a custom 6x9 envelope with a custom message.

Thanks, Barnett


author: JIRAUSER11103
comment: [~barnetts] 
Can you provide the measurement for the envelope windows?


author: JIRAUSER11103
comment: [~barnetts] 
Is the window the same as a regular 6x9 like the envelope with stock code 4412?


author: JIRAUSER11103
comment: [~barnetts] 
Just to follow up from my message this morning, please providethe measurement for the custom envelope windows, otherwise it may delay samples


author: JIRAUSER11103
comment: [~barnetts] 
Samples are due today and I haven't been provided the measurements for the custom envelope windows


author: JIRAUSER11103
comment: [~barnetts] 
Samples will be delayed until a new SOW and the measurements for the envelope windows are provided.



[~TunA]FYI


author: barnetts
comment: Hi [~Natalie.Tom],

Sorry for the delay. I reached out to Gabriel for the exact spec, but the measurement should match the house 6x9 house envelope except that it has a tagline added.
* Imprint tagline on existing house 4412 #6x9.5 permit stock the tagline "IMPORTANT TAX DOCUMENT ENCLOSED" in PMS 1797 Red on the front.

The 6x9 envelope specs are attached. 

Thanks, Barnett

Per OPS
 IS adds jobs to the ETA board; that is not a pc function.

[~barnetts]-- In the Latest print sample for the envelope 4412 , name is parially displayed in the window. Do you want this fixed or pass with notes?

author: barnetts
comment: Hi [~Natalie.Tom] / [~Igor.Khosid] / [~gthillaivel],

I say pass with notes. The name portion that shows due to margins looks very small to me. What are your thoughts [~gthillaivel]?

author: JIRAUSER11103
comment: [~barnetts] 
I found the issue and it's because it needs to have an ENV2, that isn't in the SOW. I've updated the control file to also have ENV2="5333". I will have DP run it again, please let me know if there's a different envelope code for ENV2
