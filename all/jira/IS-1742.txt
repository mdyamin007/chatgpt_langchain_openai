I updated the program, tested with 2 data file.sefc.prod.EXT0571.221017.2103.pgp,sefc.prod.EXT0571.220816.2103.pgp
each file has more than 100 accounts.
I am not able to search on these data file. Contents are encrypted.
I cannot find any sample that related to this update.
Can you tell me which accounts have those changes?

[^sefcml15.pdf]here's the sample fromsefc.prod.EXT0571.221017.2103.pgp

Thanks

But I don't see any "Escrow Deferral" from any account.
here are the sample of other accounts that provided by client:
