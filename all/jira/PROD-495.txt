comment: EWBB confirmed in todays call that they are able to retrieve a response from the Get PDF API. They are not getting any connection timeout error from us, but it is taking long time to retrieve Commercial Accounts Statements.

On their side the time out limit that they have set is 30 seconds and because of the delay it is timing out on their application.

This delay is happening on test environment and they have NOT faced this issue on production. But in near future when the Commercial Accounts will be rolled to production, they are suspecting for this delay on production.

They have suggested that we compress the response in gzip format so it will utilize less bandwidth over the network and the transfer of the document would be faster.

*To Do Tasks :*
 # EWBB to give us sample sandbox API request that took over 100 seconds to respond. Also provide some commercial accounts from production to us for testing.
 # Infoimage will need to verify those requests and see if we can compress the pdf and send in the response.


Thanks,
