I don't see any mock-ups in comment #31. There are documents in comment #1. I am wondering if we should use them for verification?
 Please upload letter templates from TS?

Please, provided updated SOW

comment: [~thomasY]Any updates?

comment: [~tye.wu@infoimageinc.com]There's no new resources


author: william.kong
comment: [~dawnl]: have you received approvals from client? Approval date was due yesterday 10/6/2021. PLease advise so that we do not delay this project further with a new revised timeline.


author: dawnl
comment: The sample was sent to client for approval on 10/5.  They have not approved yet.  I have reached out to client again today.


author: william.kong
comment: [~dawnl]: As discussed in my comment above, timeline to go live is not achievable. PLease let us know when customer responds.


author: dawnl
comment: Thomas,
The samples are not correct.  See comment #82 on TS#20635.




author: thomasy
comment: [~dawnl] Why are they "incorrect"? Seems like they are asking to make additional changes to the letters.

Please attach those new templates to this jira.

New samples are attached.


author: dawnl
comment: Thomas,

The sample layout you provide are different from what client provided which included a phone number.  See the attached Balance Demand letter and CK Closure Warn Letter.  Please check client's comment #82 on teamsupport ticket #20635:

"Our team reviewed the letters and since you're using the notice template you have on file, we had to modify the letter to include our phone number.  Attached you will find the updated letters. "


author: thomasy
comment: [~dawnl]I think you are misunderstanding. Saying the first samples were incorrect is implying we did something wrong and that QA missed something. This is not the case. The first templates they provided *did not have the phone number.*They updated their templates in comment #82 and asked for the phone numbers to be*added*.



*Regardless, I attached samples 6 days ago as mentioned in the previous comment.*


author: dawnl
comment: Thomas, I just said what client said in Comment #82.   




author: dawnl
comment: Client approved the samples.


author: thomasy
comment: [~dawnl]Can you set a new live date now that samples are approved?


author: dawnl
comment: As discussed in today's scrum meeting, Tun will provide the new live date.


author: tuna
comment: Hi [~thomasY] ,

Please provide estimate live date and prepare for QA, since the sample is approved. [~dawnl] will update live date accordingly.

Thanks,

Tun

Dawn, I do not think that the 10.27.2021 life date is feasible

Because QA need to completed testing plus in addition I believe parallel test is requires in this case

comment: [~Igor.Khosid] [~gthillaivel] The index file already looks to be posted and should be viewable on infotrac stage, however all 6 accounts only have letter 052. I believe Tye added descriptions on stage for letter 052 as well as 051. 

[~thomasY] are we going to process another index file with letter 051? 


author: dawnl

I can't find the DPVS.  can you attach it?

Thomas, I just checked the index file and noticed that file provides only the letter #52. I do not see letter #51

Is this letter is suppressed form the eNotice?


author: thomasy
comment: [~Igor.Khosid]Here is nother index file with #51*vwcu_10222021_10222021_171506_vwcu.txt*


author: tuna
comment: Hi [~dawnl],

Here is recap for our conversation between Thomas, you and me.
 - We need to complete QA + parallel test. Normally, OPS needs a week for parallel test. So please set Live date to 11/03 for now.

 - The client provided following file names in TS #20635, very first comment. So please let client knows to use following file naming convention for production files. If not, the program will not pick up the files to process

     40 Day Demand for Negative Share Letter   (file name: LNS.BAL.DEMAND.LTR.DATA)
      Account Closure Warning Letter            (file name: LNS.CK.CLOS.WARN.DATA)

- Please update SOWLetter matrix for above file naming convention.

- Please tell client to inform us when they send the first production file for those two new letters. So that, we can check.

Thanks

Tun
