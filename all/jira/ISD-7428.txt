comment: Hi [~Shun.Kuwashima], I assigned this Jira to you. You can re-assign if needed, just want to get movement on this. Note; the client's target live date is 8/1

comment: Hi [~dyuen] In addition to updating the site logo, I noticed that the logo on the sample pdf shown during enrollment is the old one, so we probably need to ask IS if they can provide a sample pdf with the new logo. I've attached the current sample pdf with the old logo showing as well as a screenshot of the enrollment steps for reference. 


author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~TunA], can you review Shun's comment above and advise?

[~Shun.Kuwashima], I also realize, we may need to update the logo in MM. Is that correct?

Thanks

comment: Hi [~dyuen],

If I understand correclty for [~Shun.Kuwashima]comment, IS needs to update logo for that SEFC application or a notice type. Please open programming request for that particularapplication or notice type, with sample and new logo.

I could not provide sample pdf with correct logo, without updating logo.

Please call me if I misunderstand or need to discuss more.



Thanks,

Tun

comment: Hi [~dyuen], after looking at this ticket again maybe I misunderstood. Initially I thought the site logo was the last place to be updated, however I checked a few different statement types and they all still use the same logo as shown in the enrollment sample pdf. If the client only wants the site logo updated, then maybe we can hold off on updating the logo on the sample pdf until the client wants to update it on all their statements. Can you confirm? Thanks


author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~Shun.Kuwashima], that's correct. SEFC currently only wants to update the logo on their member site. The logo update for their statements and notices will come later.

Thanks!


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~dyuen] Gotcha, in that case the sample pdf logo update can come later. I should be able to get this out onto pilot by eod today, will let you know.


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: Hi [~dyuen], I updated the logo onto pilot for client review. If necessary, I also attached a screenshot of the pilot member site showing the new logo (sefc_new_logo_pilot.PNG). 

Also just a heads up this does require a server restart, so due to our new SOP we need to have it client approved and moved onto stage at least a week prior to production release on a wednesday. Assuming the client can approve it by maybe midday this wed 7/27, I can have it up on stage that same day for QA and then aim to release to production on 8/3. Would that be ok?


author: dyuen
comment: Thanks [~Shun.Kuwashima]. I've notified SEFC, pending confirmation on sample and if it's OK to release code on 8/3.


author: dyuen
comment: [~eric.yan], since Shun's OOO today, please see SEFC's reply to the sample below. Can you confirm if it has to do with the logos they sent us?

!InfoImage Logo.gif!

[~Shun.Kuwashima], FYI

"Daphne, Kacie said that the logo is very blurry on both desktop and mobile. Can anything be done about that? "

comment: Hi Daphne,

I've compared the tested file and the current logo file and they have the same resolution (72ppi). Please ask the client to provide a logo file with higher resolution to improve the blurry issue.

author: dyuen
comment: An updated logo has been requested.


author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~Shun.Kuwashima], SEFC provided a new logo since the last one was kind of blurry. Can you update it with the one attached?

"Logo Updated_07272022"

!Logo Updated_07272022.gif!




author: shun.kuwashima
comment: Hi [~dyuen], I've replaced the initial logo with the 'Logo Updated_07272022.gif' file and it's ready on pilot, however it looks to have the same blurriness as before. I checked the resolution and it appears to be the same compared to the old logo that is sitting on production. Regardless can they check and if possible provide a file with higher resolution?


author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~Shun.Kuwashima], gotcha. I asked if SEFCU can do so. I'll let you know as soon as I get a response.

Thanks!


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: Hi [~dyuen], I updated the logo with the PNG format that wilson provided. Attached new screenshot as well (sefc_new_logo_pilot.PNG), please have the client test again on pilot. Thanks!


author: dyuen
comment: Thanks [~Shun.Kuwashima]! Updated screenshot sent to SEFC for review/approval.


author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~Shun.Kuwashima], per comment 54 on the ticket. This is approved. I'll wait for your next update on next steps.

Thanks!


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid], this is just verifying that the member site logo is updated. Please follow the instructions below for both scenarios of an enrolled and unenrolled user on stage:

Enrolled user:
1. On the SSO test page, click on the 'stage' button and then click on the 'Alkami Primary Stage' tab. 
2. Use the prefilled info to complete the sso steps.
3. Once landing on the home page, the logo in the top left corner should match what is provided in sefc_new_logo_pilot.PNG attached to this story.

Unenrolled user:
1. Repeat step 1 from the Enrolled User steps above.
2. Please replace the following fields with the values below, which should let you complete the sso steps for an unenrolled user:
CIF Number: 100066
MemberNumber(CIF): 100066
AcctNumber: 1698377570
AcctNumber: 1698377570
3. After submitting the ssoKey, you should land on the enrollment steps where the logo in the top left should match sefc_new_logo_pilot.PNG.

Let me know if there are any issues.

[~dyuen] since this requires a server restart, we need to go by our new SOP and the earliest I can release this to production would be on Wed, 8/10. Can you update the due date on this story? Thanks

author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~dyuen] I've released the new logo onto production, please have the client confirm. Note: I ran into some issues deploying the usual way, so I manually moved over the logo file for now. Let me know if there are any issues.
