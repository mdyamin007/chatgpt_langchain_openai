Thank you!

comment: [~Juliana Vannik] 
 The data file used was "SSCU_DL_040822.zip.pgp". File name used for samples was "S61_040722"


author: JIRAUSER11300
comment: [~Natalie.Tom] Client asks for a copy of the notice using the PS_DPIUD file attached. [^PS_DPIUD(1).stm]  This will be the file name going forward.
Thank you!


author: JIRAUSER11300
comment: [~Natalie.Tom] Please find below additional feedback from the client:
1.	Needs new logo.
2.	Change Call Center to Contact Center in first bullet: "Call SAFE's Contact Center...") and title: "VP, Contact Center"
3.	Change "Live Help" to "Live Chat"
4.	Add a return before the signature. There should be 3 lines, 4 returns.

comment: [~Natalie.Tom] Just to add to the feedback:
 # Please use the same logo as used for all other daily notices, it should be their newest version (if this is the one you used, please let us know).

Please confirm new sample date.

Thanks!

comment: Hi [~phoebe.george], [~Juliana Vannik],

I think we are updating wrong notice. "Inactive Account Notice (dl019)" is in old SSCU daily application (SSCUDLA) using data file (S61_MMDDYY.txt).

[~lemoy28]mentioned yesterday that SSCUDLA is not process since04/11/2022. [~Natalie.Tom]told me the data file that client provided yesterday is not the same format with(S61_MMDDYY.txt) for DL019

I don't see new notice name S61 with data file namePS_DPIUD in new notices application (SSCUDLE).

*Is that possible for new setup?*if it is for new setup, we will need to reassess the request. hours and timeline will not be the same.

Please let me and [~Natalie.Tom]know how to proceed.



Thanks,

Tun

comment: [~TunA] [~Natalie.Tom] I confirmed with client. The original notice that this should replace in the current daily notice program (for the core conversion) is notice code 100. This was previously removed from the implementation setup back on 4/5. However, they would like to use this to re-initiate this notice. Can you confirm what would need to be done in order to set this up for the original notice code 100?

Here is the SOW link, please reference the letter matrix at the end of the document:

comment: Hi [~phoebe.george],

Yes we can add new notice as DL100 for SSCUDLE application.

Can you please provide following information for setup? I add new assessment below. But [~Natalie.Tom]can start only after she got all the information she needs. So the timeline depends upon those.



- File naming convention?

- Letter name?

- What output product (Paper or enotice or both)?

- If required enotice setup, do data file has correct account number to post?

Based on the 'New' specifications, we need a NEW Epic and Stories after the estimate/timeline mentioned from [~TunA] has been signed off.
