This update to PROVML11.dfa (Loan Bills),PROVML21.dfa (Neg Am), andPROVML41.dfa (Commercial Loan) is ready for sample review.

Also, provided ISD with index files to post to staging and new pseg to upload S1PROVN4.300 (new resource created as client wants old estatements to have the old message).

Exported project files to shared drive: /d/iss/qa/PROV/PROVML#1.zip
 * DPVS attached[^provml1101_dpvs.pdf][^provml2101_dpvs.pdf][^provml4101_dpvs.pdf]
 * Attached combined sample containing the new message #4 for each of the 3 different loan types[^provml_combined_sample.pdf]

Note that the message list _PROV_MSG_LIST_100121.txt.pgp_from the set of data files used in this test cycle has been artificially modified to have certain accounts display message #4 (as no recent data from production contains all of the updated loan types in addition to containing an account with message #4).

Sam - could you please check the exported "PROVML11.dfa". I do not see the message there. Also - "message list" on papyrus - getting an error

Updates on 1.PROVML21.dfa and 2PROVML41.dfa - looks good

Talked to Igor regarding what he pointed out. PROVML11.dfa should be good to go.

Also, exported local project files PROVML11.zip and PROVML41.zip again so that document #1 for PROVML11 and document #2 for PROVML41 feature message #4.

comment: Hi Sam,

Customer responded to the sample:

"Hi Bill, could we please change this so there are no hyphenated words at the end of a line (Forbear - ance and prin - cipal)? I think there is room to move the full word to the lower line in each case and not use additional lines. Also, so that we are consistent, could we please chance the capitalized word Principal to NOT be capitalized (just principal not Principal) on the third line of the second paragraph."
