comment: I just spoke with Jessica. Since we are pending approvals for the logo update project, we want to get a head start on releasing the logo changes prior to their final approvals so that we do not have to rush tomorrow.





[~thomasY]: Please release the CFCU Monthly Statement Logo updates.



*PC/DP*: Per talking with Jessica, we need to go through approval process for Monthly and HELOC. So after processing, please hold the job for client to review and approve.



[~dawnl] and [~Jessica] : FYI
