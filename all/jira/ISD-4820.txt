comment: Internal update:

Moved initial disclosure onto pilot, had to copy over to pilot proxy 04 to see the change. Pending response from client about the footer.

comment: recent pilot proxy server was made, there was a new path for the disclosures on the proxy servers that was not implemented. Tested again and now works both externally and internally on pilot.

comment: Hi QA,

The disclosure has been updated on stage. Please verify on stage that the disclosure tab and the enrollment steps show the new disclosure. Instructions are as follows:

Checking the Disclosure tab:
 - You can use all the default values on the SSO test page to login and view the change on the Disclosure tab.

Checking enrollment steps:
 - Enter in a random CIF (i.e. 1234567891 should work)
 - Change 'UserType' to P
 - Remove the value in the 'login_id' section, this field should be empty.
 - Everything else can remain as the default values.

An easy way to see the difference is by going to the bottom of the disclosure and checking the last section. The new disclosure will say "How to Contact Us". The old disclosure will have a 
 section that says "COMMUNICATION WITH US".

Please clear cache and try again if you do not see the update immediately. I attached a doc in the Attachments section (banb_disclosure_stage.docx) that shows the expected results for the tab and enrollment. Let me know if there are any issues.
