*Gnana*,
 Did you complete the first round of testing? I do not see any activities. *The story assigned to you yesterday at 2:59 PM*

*Barnett*,

Gnana did not complete the comparison yet, and you already sent it to the client for review?

The *sample date to customer is 10.19.2021*


author: barnetts
comment: [~Igor.Khosid],

Yes, I sent the samples for review. I thought they were ready. SSCU are not quick with their review, so I can always send them updated samples as needed. 

Thanks, Barnett 


author: igor.khosid
comment: [~barnetts] [~gthillaivel]

Gnana, did not finish the first samples review yet, and as you can see, the status on the story is still "Waiting for QA" and not "Waiting for approval."



Gnana,

Please complete testing ASAP

comment: Hi [~jira_naru],

SSCU want the following updates:
1. Updated masking from 9 X's to 6 X's instead in the "Re: Account #" field.
2. Remove the spacing before the 1st X.
For example, "Re: Account #XXXXXX100"
3. Update the footer date from (09/14/21) to (10/29/21) 

Thanks, Barnett  [^Changes Mockup_10.21.21.pdf]

comment: [~jira_naru],

SSCU is stating that the signature looks pixelated. Is there a way we can do to a clearer signature?

Thanks, Barnett 


author: jira_naru
comment: Barnett:

TheSignature.JPG, provided in TS22676, is 72 DPI. We need a 300 DPI tiff image.

If you want to better the quality of the signature image, please request new signature tiff image, with 300 dpi.

Can you update the procs file .


author: jira_naru
comment: Gnana:

Letter 041 is an existing letter, so proc file already contains this letter. No update to proc file required.

comment: [~gthillaivel]: Please confirm QA status as to whether or not it is passed based on Nar's comment above.

comment: Hi [~jira_naru]/ [~gthillaivel],

Per SSCU, "The business is concerned about the off-color white around the signature. Can we use try this signature."  [^JamesRichie.tif] 

Thanks, Barnett 


author: jira_naru
comment: Barnett:

The image file JamesRichie.tif is not 300 DPI, it is actually 96 DPI. So, the signature will not be sharp.

If they want to improve the quality, please provided 300 DPI.

The main contact is out on vacation until 11/8, I pushed the due date back to reflect this.

comment: [~barnetts]: You forgot to update the due date to 11/12; I will adjust this ticket to 11/12.


author: william.kong
comment: [~barnetts]: Any updates? I really do not want to keep delaying this project. PLease advise/.


author: barnetts
comment: [~William.Kong],

I haven't heard back from SSCU. I will follow up with them.


author: barnetts
comment: [~jira_naru],

SSCU responded. They are having trouble getting an updated image of the tiff signature. They said to use the previous 300 tiff image and it is approved.

This letter is print only, mail_code2 hard coded to 'z' in the DFA, so no eNotice for this letter.


author: william.kong
comment: [~barnetts]: I noticed status is "Sample Approved".



[~Igor.Khosid]: Can you confirm if this project passed QA? I'm not sure if it passed QA since the status has changed. If not, can you update status be to "QA In Progress".

comment: [~William.Kong] [~jira_naru] [~barnetts] [~TunA]

Will - as you can see, the status on the ticket is "*Pilot / Sample approved*," meaning that we just did preliminary first-round testing.
If development is completed, the status needs to be moved to "*Request QA*," and we can finish the testing.
*Please, before turning the ticket to QA, be sure all required for the testing information provided*
