comment: [~yameelee] and [~Peter.Dang]: Is EWBB code supposed to communicate in Dev environment to production database? In screenshot #2, i noticed the connection string is asking for a Production connection string.



Screenshot #1: Is a valid error and I don't think will need to address it at this time unless we should adjust the code to ignore FTP call in "Dev" environment.

Screenshot #3: I will need to review that later.

Screenshot #4: Eventually in a month or so, i will work with someone from our team to introduce a Dev PDF Archival processing program.

comment: [~yameelee]: In your email on 5/11, i'm address item #2. It's not really an issue but something that we know longer need:



Can you please help me release the following in parallel? Per Ernest a long time ago, we dont need the following type of logic:

cp /isis/$pdel/pdol3 .

cp /isis/$pdel/FILTER .

cp /isis/$pdel/TIFFG4 .

cp /isis/$pdel/BARCODE .
