comment: Hi [~dawnl]

Who is supposed to provide isd hour? Since this is a new logo we need to provide this logo to isd. So would you please create isd story?



Thanks


author: dawnl
comment: Hi [~rony]- IS needs to let ISD knowIS needs to provide this logo to isd. Then ISD needs to provide the ISD hours in the PR #28440. I need ISD hours to create ISD story.


author: rony
comment: Hi [~dawnl]

So at this point you already know that we need to provide logo to isd would it be possible for you to let them know.

comment: [~TunA]: I'm talking with [~rumanb]right now, parallel has not passed yet. Let's hope it does not fail at OPS. If it does, we will need to fix code and re-release..


author: rony
comment: Hi [~William.Kong]

The parallel is passed.

It's not Ruman's fault . I asked him to do CVS check-in and I think I checked the parallel ts first and saw that ops printed the dpvs,sample . May be I was mistaken or messed up with other ts.
