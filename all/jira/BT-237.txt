title: c/o LSTX Property Management line is added to all documents, unconditionally
description: From what I can see in the samples, all recipients get "c/o LSTX Property Management" line in the address, even if their billing name is NOT "c/o LSTX Property Management".

Could you kindly check with the customer if this is what they meant? I feel that the condition about billing name might be omitted in their comment 24, TS #31553, since they were talking regarding the product codes there.

comment: Here is final change request from client per client in comment #24,TS #31553:

"

I think requests are mixed. What we are asking is like below:

1. Add Additional billing name after customer name( FOR all PRODUCT CODE)

2. Change logic for delinquency notice - add delinquency notice when overdue date count is over 45 (ONLY FOR PRODUCT CODE 5017340001)

comment: Hi [~avannik]

I updated the code now so that "c/o LSTX Property Management" is not showing on all account anymore. Please see my comment on IS-1467 for details.

Thank,
