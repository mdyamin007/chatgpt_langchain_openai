title: TS 31215/31193 | UCCU, SLCU - Decryption Email Alert (Scanner)
description: Files failed to decrypt, one for UCCU, SLCU, etc.

The issue is that an email alerting DP that decryption failed was suppose to send. However, it didn't.
 # UCCU didn't get an email.
 # SLCU got an email, but the email contains null in the email content.
