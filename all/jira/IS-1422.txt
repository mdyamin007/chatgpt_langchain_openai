comment: Hi [~mahbubS],

Can you please answer SSCU question listed below? 

Per SSCU, 
The sample size is large.  Is it everything?  Could we get a couple of account numbers with mail restriction?  Or if you can advise which file was used maybe I could search the data file and give them account numbers? Do you know if this sampling is supposed to be statements with the Do Not Mail indicator? I reviewed over 1000 pages and every statement has a name and full address. I also pulled up a few in DNA and none of the ones I looked at have a mail restriction.

Thanks, Barnett

The data file used for sample is7_MM_STMXT_REGE_073122.txt.

This file is from cycle 0731.

Check below member numbers from sample:

42236, 97429,234554,295145,313587

These members have DO NOT MAIL in data file. In sample the "DO NOT MAIL" is not displayed and 2nd address line is displayed in address as requested.

Thanks

*Please let client know that*, if the address has DO NOT MAIL in 1st line with indicator N, and rest of the address line has indicator A then nothing will be displayed in address area in statement.

SSCU is stating that the account 42236, where if the address has DO NOT MAIL in 1st line with indicator N, and rest of the address line has indicator A then nothing will be displayed in address area in statement. They are stating that the addresses is still showing up. Can you please advise on why the address is still showing up? 

Thanks, Barnett

comment: Hi [~barnetts],

I have checked the data file and the statement.

The member number 42236 has 2 address lines with N indicator. So the 2nd address line only will get printed as 1st line has DO NOT MAIL and no address line with A indicator will get displayed as requested.

I understand what you are saying, but the problem is that attached sample shows something else.

Don't need to check paper sample because all the updates are related to statement that has "DO NOT MAIL".
