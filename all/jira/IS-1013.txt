APCUMS21.zip is in qa folder.

The purpose is to suppress participation accounts from dda.

If you check/z/apcu/apcums2113.print you will see only 1 account is in 4.2o1 rest are suppressed, all are participation accounts.

if you check this data /z/apcu/ms2/data_files/apcums3.dat the last account is the only account which is not participation account, rest are all participation accounts.

The condition for the participation account is to record 200 fields 18 value should be between 8000 to 8999.

Thanks

Rony
