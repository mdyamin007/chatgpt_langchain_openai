Additional testing will be after client approval
1. Please, provide the print samples after the sample will be approved by the customer
2. Please update the summary I do not think it is correct
3. Please be sure ISD story is assigned

Please, provide the index file to validate updated content on InfoTrac and DPVS for the print samples
