title: IDCU - [24148][pvt] Update XML tags used for name/address on Commercial Loan Bills
description: IS and ISD Assessment
 =============
 Hours for development: 2 IS hours + 1 ISD hours required
 Turnover Date :12/17/2022
 Sample to QA Date: 02/02/2022
 Sample Approval Date: 02/09/2022
 Go live date : 02/18/2022

Assessment Details (IS):
 - Parallel required: (no)

 - update parsing script,idcucl1_xmlParser.py to extract from new address tag.

 - update the formatting program IDCUCL11.dfa

 - Commercial Loan Stmt (idcucl1) -> idcucl1_process.sh
 - The XML data file used to generate our loan bills (DF mortgage, commercial, consumer) has been updated to include tags for the co-borrower's name. We need to have the Name/Address section of the Commercial loan bill updated to read the new tag set.



Attached is a mock-up of the Name/Address section that identifies the new XML tags where it needs to be mapped. I have also dropped the following TEST file to the TEST folder on the FTP:CML_LN_BLXTR_111521.7z.gpg.

*Updated 1/10/2022:*

Please refer to to attachments CML_Stmts.docx that was pulled from comment #1 TS# 24148; Apparently, these were not attached when Jira ticket was created.
