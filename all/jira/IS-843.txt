1. Overlay created and look good (Member DIF - removed)
2. Index file processed successfully:
a. Member DIF - removed from admin site
However
b. Data - missing (see attached print screen)
We might need to ask ISD to check on the issue (ISD-6481 - not assigned)

author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~rukmaniR] [~Igor.Khosid] I also don't see any content within the statements either on the admin site or the member site on stage. Is there perhaps a resource that I need to upload? 


author: igor.khosid
comment: [~rukmaniR] [~Shun.Kuwashima] [~MattL]
When I changed the job_sel to "f" - all data disappeared


author: JIRAUSER11100
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] [~Igor.Khosid]
This overlay CAMB78 is already in production and the JEF says the resources are already provided to ISD. Can you make it transparent?

Thanks!


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~rukmaniR] Thanks, I switched them to use the transparent ini file on lower env and I can see content now. 

[~Igor.Khosid] Can you try viewing again?

[~rukmaniR] - please fix issue with displaying on Papyrus
[~MattL] - please request the print samples



author: JIRAUSER11100
comment: [~Igor.Khosid] Thanks for confirming. It can't be fixed in papyrus. Since the paper is pre-print, it doesn't affect it.


author: igor.khosid
comment: [~rukmaniR]The old overlay was transparent. The new one needs to be as well. Or else how will you debug or make changes in the future ?


author: JIRAUSER11100
comment: [~Igor.Khosid] I tried to make this transparent and it didn't work for this one. I checked with Peter and he said it's okay. I can forward your question to Peter again today.

Thanks!

Create pseg and embed in a new overlay


author: JIRAUSER11100
comment: [~Igor.Khosid] This overlay is already in production and in the description it says it's created for DDA.  Peter said since paper statement is preprint, it is okay. And ISD is able to make it transparent and view the e-stmt. If we want to test it in the future, we can test the 's' option without the overlay.

Thanks!


author: JIRAUSER11100
comment: [~MattL] Any update on the print samples?
[~Igor.Khosid] is waiting for them.

Thanks!


author: mattl
comment: [~rukmaniR]will request today was waiting on response regarding the overlay.


author: JIRAUSER11100
comment: [~MattL] Thanks!


author: mattl
comment: [~rukmaniR]do you have a print range you'd like me to pull or is 1-10 okay?


author: JIRAUSER11100
comment: [~MattL] 1-10 should be okay.


author: mattl
comment: print samples attached.


author: JIRAUSER11100
comment: [~Igor.Khosid] I've made changes to the dfa. The overlay is the same. Now the data is visible with the 'f' option.  Exported the latest dfa to the qa folder. Attached the e-stmt index file.

[~MattL] If the samples are already printed, it is okay since it doesn't affect it. If it is not printed please provide them the dpvs I've attached today.

[~Shun.Kuwashima] Can you please repost the e-stmt. Attached the latest index file: aa1_12312021_1_02232022_1348_camb.txt 
The resources are the same. You may need to make it trasparent.

Thanks!

author: JIRAUSER11100
comment: [~MattL] I checked the afp. PO Box is not there. I'll check with Peter and get back to you.

Thanks!


author: JIRAUSER11100
comment: [~MattL] Can you please check the current production prints? 

Thanks!


author: igor.khosid
comment: [~rukmaniR] [~MattL]

Please check on the endorsement location


author: JIRAUSER11100
comment: [~MattL] [~Igor.Khosid] Both endorsement and the PO BOX number comes from the cover overlay which is currently in production. These should be in the same position in production samples. Please compare. 

Thanks!


author: igor.khosid
comment: [~rukmaniR] [~MattL]

Rukmani - could you please provide a production sample? For some reason, I can't allocate one


author: JIRAUSER11100
comment: [~Igor.Khosid] [~MattL] Please request laser to print the production sample. I've attached the dpvs from production. Please confirm with dp if it is the latest dpvs.

Thanks!
