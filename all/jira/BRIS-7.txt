title: Create IS Platform VMs (IS-Dept)
description: Per our Brisbane Planning meeting, we wanted to get a few VM created so that we can install the applications and perform minimal functional testing before the March 1st 2020 deadline.



The goal is try to install things from scratch. For one of the VM (i.e. RHS), we want to make sure Papyrus isrunnable within a VM.



These are the systems we are requesting to get setup from an OS level. Once each VM is setup, I will create a separate Epic per VM so that we can track the details/progress/bugs for each VMs.

*As of Jan 17, 2020:*

**Because of the 1.5 month delay to get Brisbane Server(s), we are going to need a snapshot of all the hardware to do the testing at a minimum. There will be+additional+ servers needed AFTER we get the real hardware in Brisbane**

comment: Kent, should we move the due date to 12/23? I chatted with Prem yesterday and he said "maybe" we are getting vm ready after Saturday maintenance.



Please advise as I'd like to start working on some of the VM during the low activity next week in light of the holidays.

comment: Prem, per our conversation earlier today. I will need dns added and also need Ferhat to help give access IP access from my local IP address. An email was sent earlier with this information.
