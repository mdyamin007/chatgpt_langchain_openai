Update/home/master/apcuud1_process.sh to have logic to copy archival toinfoftps3/apcu/client_pickup/ using the copyToClientPickup.pl as standard SOP. This script will keep a log of all files placed into client_pickup folder.

Would you please releaseapcums2_process.sh apcuud1_process.sh.

Updates are:

adding 2 echo line in *apcums2_process.sh* so it showsapcu_bb_backup.sh was called and successfully exited

add copytoclientpickup script call in *apcuud1_process.sh* instead of using cp command to copy to client pickup folder.



I tested this in parallel.



Thanks
