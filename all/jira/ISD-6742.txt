All the resources look good on my side and the same ones I used for archival and paper which are showing up.

[~eric.yan]can you view the resources to see if they are showing up or empty?

Also the accounts you provided for samples do not have inserts. These are selective inserts and only some accounts have inserts which is why I provided the 14 accounts for the 14 different scenarios.
