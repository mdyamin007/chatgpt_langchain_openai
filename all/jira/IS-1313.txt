Based on the last Rony's comments, my understanding - is that the on-shore team still needs to work on "FICS Late Notice (401)".
Please assign the story to the person who will be working on the story and then turn it over to QA for the sample review.
>>>
Unless "FICS Late Notice (401)" - already allocated as the separate project
[~barnetts] - please coordinate the transition

Print samples have blank page for clcudl001 and clcudl002 (simplex) and for clcudl002 ,does not have blank page after the notice.
As per SOW clcudl001,clcudl002,clcudl003 all are displayed as simplex. As per print samples ,clcudl003 is printed as duplex.
Either SOW should be corrected or print samples should be ..Below is the screenshot

Not sure what is going on. There should not be blank pages but the updated disclosure. We didn't make any other changes besides replacing current discolsure. Didn't change anything about simplex/duplex.

Did you see updated disclosure in print sample ?



Thanks


author: barnetts
comment: Hi [~gthillaivel] / [~Igor.Khosid],

I do not see any updates in the SOW in regards to "Simplex or Duplex"

Please update SOW or [~rony] need to update the script
