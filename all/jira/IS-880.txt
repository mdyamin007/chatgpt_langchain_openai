I didn't see any IS assessment history in TS26909.

Who assess this request? Can you please assign TS26909 to that person? So that we know who will work on this.

Thanks,

Tun

comment: Hi [~William.Kong]

would you please help with the prefix here. It seems like both sncums1 and ms2 need to be updated.

In the script sncums1_process.sh I am seeing 2 more visa file extension besides mentioned in the description. vpr and vpv. So need to disable those also I am guessing.

In the IS assessment section per the Description:
 * *Update on processing scripts and remove logic to ignore processing the following Credit Card Data files:* - Just reconfirming, we will ignore the visa files to be processed?





Thanks

comment: [~rony]: The scope of work for this project to not have any Visa Statement logic since another vendor will be producing their Visa Statement(s). So yes, please ignore and do not process any Visa Statement data.

Sorry, yesterday we were off due to our holiday. The sample is/d/infoftps3/Vend_DSI/client_pickup/print_process/SNCU/sncums1.pdf.

Please ask any IS tech person to pick it up for you.

We used 31MAR22_STMT.zip.pgp data to generate sample.



Thanks

comment: Hi [~dawnl] and [~Jessica] ,



[~Peter.Dang] and I spoke with [~rony] during our weekly status meeting. This project has not been approved nor [~Igor.Khosid] QAd yet. This project do require parallel The live date of 4/29 will be missed. Bear in mind, this project is to discontinue Card Card data from being generated in our combined Statement & Visa logic so that their +new+ Visa Print vendor can print the Visa Statements moving forward.



Please confirm that client is +fully+ aware that we will still continue to produce their Monthly Statement & Visa credit card statement this EOM? I want to make sure that their new Visa Credit Card print vendor does not produce the Credit Card statements since our project here is not approved yet.

We may need to hold on this project for now. See client's update today:

"Our credit card conversion was moved from April to October and will happen at the same time as our core conversion.

I assume we'll still need to go through the same process. The file that was put out there is no longer there.

Perhaps we should touch base with Phoebe who is our PM on this conversion.

Thanks!

Kathy"

comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid]

/d/ac-secure-share/ac/dawn/is-880/sncums1P138.pdf is the sample pdf. There are 2 updates remove visa product and unmask account no.

This sample was generated from31MAR22_STMT.zip.pgp which also visa files but if you see the pdf there are no visa account info , also the account no is unmasked.

[~kericapote] [~dawnl] this should go through parallel too. Would it be possible to move the live date by 1 more week, 10/07 for both removal of visa and unmask account no?



Thanks

comment: Hi [~rony],

Per Phoebe, thisupdate is cancelled and the work order will be billable based on the work already completed even though we will not be releasing the change. See below (comment #61 TS#26909).

"Dawn, as mentioned in my comment #55, based on the original request for this programming update, the code release would have been needed if the CU wanted to move forward with discontinuing the VISA statements prior to the core conversion. I believe that the programming should be 'cancelled' based on Kathy's confirmation, and the work order should be billable based on the work already completed (programming hours), even though we will not be releasing the change.

"

Comment #55" But Kathy is correct, there is no programming update/change that needs to happen any longer to split out VISA statements from monthly statements.

10/1 production cycle will be run "as is" with Mo and VISA statements combined.

As of 11/1 production cycle, the new program that Keri is working on will REPLACE the existing monthly statements based on the core conversion."
