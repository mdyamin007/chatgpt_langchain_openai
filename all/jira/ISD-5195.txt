title: 22144 - BANB - PDF Captcha Code issue
description: Multiple customers are having issues with going past the PDF Captcha step during enrollment on production. However after clicking on the 'I CAN see PDF' again, they can move on to the terms and conditions page. Based on the logs, it appears that sometimes the actual captcha code shows as 'null' instead of showing the actual code. Below is a snippet I found from the hypercube logs showing the actual captcha code as null:

2021-08-19 14:32:50:3000 - info: banb server/methods.js :: enrollEstmtVerifyCaptchaCodeLog - actual captcha 'null'
2021-08-19 14:32:50:3010 - info: banb server/methods.js :: enrollEstmtVerifyCaptchaCodeLog - input captcha 'gFpQmc'
2021-08-19 14:32:55:6020 - info: banb server/methods.js :: enrollEstmtVerifyCaptchaCodeLog - actual captcha 'null'
2021-08-19 14:32:55:6030 - info: banb server/methods.js :: enrollEstmtVerifyCaptchaCodeLog - input captcha 'gFpQmc'

Below is the client's experience:
1.  Click on Statements from within Online Banking
2.  Presented with the PDF Verification Screen
3.  Input CAPTCHA Code
4.  Receive Error for Invalid Security Code
5.  Did not change anything in the box where I typed the code and clicked the 'I CAN see PDF' button again.
6.  Accepted the code and moved to the next step to review and accept the T&Cs.  
Garth experienced this today in production at approximately 1:15 PM PT with CIF G001056

I've also attached a document provided by the client that describes the issue.
