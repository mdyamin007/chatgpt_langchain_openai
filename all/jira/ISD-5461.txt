title: SNFB - Pioneer Bank Merger (Pre-ingestion)
description: Load pre-ingestion files for SNFB Merger.

NEW LIVE DATE of 5/6/22.

comment: For pre-ingestions, should update the create_time of the p_jobs to a past date that is really old. That way, these jobs won't show up in any of the recent accounting reports. It will minimize the questions we get from Accounting.

E.g. set create_time = '31-AUG-2000' (preferably a date with no existing cycles), job_num = 'PreIng'. Easy to do a sum later, too.

comment: Run 24 months of pre-ingestions. Pass through the manual scanner. Remember to turn off emails before processing. And make sure no cycles are running around the time so that production cycles are not affected.

comment: [~tai.trinh] [~Ethan.Yu] I have received an update set of test files from the bank and attached here. They added the disclosure backer to the eStatement PDFs. 

Note that they are aware that the disclosure is appearing twice in the PDF; they will be correcting this before they send the PDF files to us for full pre-ingestion. Here is a recap of the schedule: Attached is the file - please confirm that this can be loaded to the pilot; let me know target date of when it can be completed.

+[^SNFB_ms1_09022021_1.zip]+



+Final Pre-ingestion Files+:
 # SNFB will be sending 2 years total of pre-ingestion files.

Files will be sent in 3 batches (based on how FIS provides):
 * Batch 1 = 11/1/2019  9/30/2021
 * Batch 2 = 10/1/2021  10/31/2021
 * Batch 3 = 11/1/2021  11/5/2021

 # InfoIMAGE will setup a new sub-folder in the FTP directory.

_UPDATE:_ This has already been done; sub-folder name = preingestion
 # Schedule:

 * InfoIMAGE will need to benchmark processing time once an initial full production batch is provided (for one month of statement PDFs).
 * FIS is behind schedule, but will be sending the hard drive of data to the bank by Monday, 10/18.

Based on receipt, the bank will target to provide the initial batch of data the week of 10/18.

Based on the file size, InfoIMAGE can review a transmission schedule with the bank for the 2 years of data.
 * Target goal is to load all pre-ingestion files by end of day 11/5/21.

This will be best case scenario based on receiving all pre-ingestion for Batch 1 data by 10/25/21.

NOTE: InfoIMAGE will load recent cycles first and work backwards to older data once received.

comment: [~Ethan.Yu] can you confirm target ETA to post the 10/19 file to the pilot site? Thanks!

SNFB got their new/final merger live date approved. It is scheduled for 5/6/22.

Back in October, we had loaded test cycles to the pilot site. These files will still be the same ones used for pre-ingestion. I can't access the account numbers that were loaded to the pilot site anymore, since they are past the 90 days.

[~Ethan.Yu] Can you provide about 5-10 account numbers from these previous cycles that you had loaded to forward to SNFB to review. If all is good, I'm hoping we can move forward. Thank you!

comment: [~Ethan.Yu] [~Tin.Chak] Hoping you can provide an update on this today - see my previous comment.

On 3/22, SNFB sent another test file with some updates to re-packaging the file into smaller segments for the bigger batches - based on the current program that you have in place, can you try test loading this cycle?

Thank you!

comment: Hi [~phoebe.george] ,



I'll try and load this today. I'll need to discuss with you on what steps need to be done resuming this effort as I've forgotten where we left off.

comment: [~Ethan.Yu] Can you provide an update on this today, I need to update SNFB on the possible testing and timeframe. Thank you!

comment: Hi [~phoebe.george],

I'll let you know when this is loaded today.

The client might need to make changes. The file wasn't able to process. I'm looking into the issue.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~Ethan.Yu] Per our discussion, SNFB has made the necessary changes for repackaging the preingestion files and re-sent a batch last night. Can you try processing/posting as soon as possible today to confirm if all loaded successfully?

Thank you!

comment: [~Ethan.Yu] The pre-ingested files that were loaded to pilot have been approved by SNFB based on access through pilot Admin Site and SSO.

They want to still test through DSO, but need to have some of the merger accounts loaded in the Auth file. They sent a test AUTH file on 4/13 - can this be loaded to pilot site so they can provide final approval on viewing the posted pre-ingestion cycle through DSO channel on pilot?

Received 4/13:
|test/SNFB_TESTAUTH_041322.PGP|


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~Ethan.Yu] I received approval on the pilot site. Customer accessed and viewed the posted cycles through SSO pilot, DSO and Admin Site. All displayed as expected.

Please proceed with next steps for file processing for preingestion. Let me know if we need to setup a call to discuss how best this can be done.

Tai assisted with a high number of preingestion files when we worked on STAR, so not sure if we should follow the same process, or if DP will assist with processing. We have all current pre-ingestion files already that can be used for production. Let me know if a call should be setup to review internally.

Let's set up a call to get on the same page for this production run. I should have time tomorrow.

I've run 19 files for the last batch of SNFB merger. Please confirm if this count is correct. If so I'll close out this ticket.
