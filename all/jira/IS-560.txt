The first round testing completed and sample - ready for the client review


author: dawnl
comment: Hi Mahbub,

Please upload the sample to PFCU client pick up folder.   Client needs to review and approve the sample.
I don't have access to this DSI folder /d/infoftps3/Vend_DSI/client_pickup/print_process/PFCU/sample/pfcums11314.2o1.pdf.

Thanks.


author: mahbubs
comment: Hi Dawn,

I hope/d/infoftps3/Vend_DSI/client_pickup/print_process/PFCU/ is already the client pickup folder.

Which client pickup folder you are suggesting?

If you can access/z/download/pfcu/pfcums11314.2o1.pdf then please copy this file to your desired directory.

Thanks
