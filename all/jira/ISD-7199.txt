I need to confirm what the enotice tab should be named? Since all three letters would be under the same tab. Would "E-Notice" be ok?


author: eric.yan
comment: ext_type_mapping is updated with new NCR code in all env.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~eric.yan]- yes, "E-Notice" will be ok.
