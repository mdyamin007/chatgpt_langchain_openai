comment: Comment from Tai:

We might want to introduce a flag that will delete the UFA for clients that want to configure this way. Otherwise, it's a pointless operation for clients that have Auth file processing. If the Auth file is not updated, the UFA get added back in anyway. So for such clients, the Auth file should be the thing that manages UFA.

There's an additional layer of business logic to consider also: subusers. Taking HTBK as an example from Prism:
If user is Primary User, UFAs are only set back to pre-reg. Actual deletion is left to the Auth file, once it's up-to-date.
If user is Subuser, UFAs are deleted, since subusers are SSO only.



Comment fro DSI:

right now the user does not get removed completely rather it just sits there inactively. that's why the verbiage is like that. we can update as you suggested and thus the user will be removed from that account. we can also introduce flags as Tai advised so that it can be configured for individual client

comment: I need to follow up with DSI and check when the fix will be implemented.
