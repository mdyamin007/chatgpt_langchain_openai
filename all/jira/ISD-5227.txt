title: 22224 - SEFC - InfoTRAC Internet Explorer issue
description: We are no longer supporting some modules in InfoTRAC via Internet Explorer. There was an announcement from Microsoft that they are going to stop supporting internet explorer browser on June 15, 2022. See link to announcement. This led to us to disabling support via IE. 

For RWCU, we have updated configuration to use old account management tab since they have only internet explorer available. If sefc has no such restriction we should ask them to use other browsers like chrome.
