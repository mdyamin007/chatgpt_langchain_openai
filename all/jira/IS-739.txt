Parallel Required: No

Program name: tfcume2 (HELOC):

Update program to fix first page veribiage and backer disclosure verbiage:

For the regular heloc, please refer to attachment "Updated TECH CU statement HELOC-TCU_jc 111721.docx". In this word document, please update the verbiage with the green font.

Looks like the DFA backer is typed in and not using a PSEG image.



Add new logic to use different verbiage for HELOC Point statement.

Look for Product Type 894 in Record 500 Field 7.

For this 894 loan product type, use a different verbiage, please refer to attachment "Mock up HELOC-POINT.docx"

comment: Hi Anwar,

Thanks.

comment: Hi [~dawnl],

Sorry for the late response. Here is the sample.[^TFCUME21.pdf]
1st account normal HELOC, 2nd one POINT.

Thanks,
Anwar

comment: Hi Anwar,

Here is the feedback from client:

"

Julie and I reviewed the samples and have the following questions:

1. Were these two accounts from the test file that we provided. How did your IS team determine which account was new POINT Heloc product 894?

2. The cycle and statement dates weren't correct for Heloc.

3. We can't distinguish which statement is new POINT and which is revised Tech CU statement.

4. Neither of them are updated to match the backers per our WO request.

Kindly let us know asap if we would receive a new set of samples or if we need to have a meeting for further discussion.

Thank you

"

Please check.



Thanks,

Dawn

comment: Hi [~dawnl],
 * POINT Heloc looked up by record 500 and field 7 == 894
 * Didn't realize they provided us test data. New sample uses this file 'tfcu_heloc_122321_TEST' & 'Loan_verbiages_09272021'
 * POINT Sample found 2 account:[^TFCU_HELOC_POINT.pdf]
 * HELOC first 50 accounts:[^TFCU_HELOC.pdf]
 * "LATE CHARGE" paragraph comes from 'Loan_verbiages_09272021', so may not excatly match like the word document. 
 * I didn't understand no 4. From my understanding they just updated verbaige of the backers. Are they saying it doesn't match excatly like the word file here? For example, colors ? Please clearify "match the backers".
 * Followed these two documents:[^Updated TECH CU statement HELOC-TCU_jc 111721.docx] [^Mock up HELOC-POINT.docx]

Thanks,
 Anwar

comment: [~dawnl]/[~anwarh]: Is this project still pending client approval. This Jira ticket is way over due (2/14/2022). Please advise status and when we can get client final approvals. Then we can revisit timeline for QA and go live date since this project does not require parallel.


author: dawnl
comment: Here is the feedback from client:

3/3: Thank you for your understanding. We will have the test file submitted by tomorrow or early next week.

2/14: The changes look good and matched to request on our WO.

However, we are going to perform end to end testing and would like to create another test file. Would you kindly let us know if it would be doable?

We will let you know the live date for the current Heloc statements once I get a confirmation from management."
