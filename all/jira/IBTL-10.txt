title: RHS:  Modify all of the scripts to not use hostname but instead System Environment variable OR global configuration
description: Please analyze the code to confirm the purpose of why using hostname and convert them to use environment variable.



*+Common Case #1:+*

hostname to check if system is 'rht'. The main purpose is to check if we are running on a machine use "development" mode. If so, i would suggest to either use an global environment variable or global configuration.

e.g. code: /home/master/fnbkcm1_process.sh,/home/master/tax_process.sh, /home/master/daily_mail.py, etc...



*+Common Case #2:+*

There is code that needs to use hostname for the sole purpose to determine which machine the process is running on and outputs to log/report. In these cases, there is *NO* need to change the logic. For troubleshooting, we do need logic to output the host name into the log/report to know which system it is running on.

e.g.

/home/master/isisdisk.sh: echo -e "hostname=$HOSTNAME" >> ${isd_share_fileid_folder}${fileid_idx}



Here are two grep functions to research:




{noformat}
grep -rH 'HOSTNAME' /home/master/* | grep -v '$HOSTNAME'
grep -rH 'hostname' /home/master/* | grep -v '$hostname' | grep -v '${hostname}' | grep -v ' hostname ' | grep -v "[._]hostname" | grep -v "[ ]hostname,
{noformat}






I would suggest the following modes to consider:

prod

parallel

pilot

dev

dr

test



Suggestion is to leverage the /etc/profile:




{code:java}
export runmode=dsi
#modify the/home/master/env_init.sh code:
if[ $RUNMODE = 'test' ]; then
  export d_dir ='/d'
  export pdel = '....'
elif[ $RUNMODE = 'parallel' ]; then 
  export d_dir ='/z' 
  export pdel = '....'
  if[ $LOGGROUP = "DSI" ]; then
    export d_dir='/home/test/z/'
  fi
fi
{code}
