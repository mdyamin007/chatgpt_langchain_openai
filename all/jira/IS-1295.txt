----------------------Per Tricia (comment 23)----------------------------------

We are upgrading our system on 8/7/22 and there are a couple of new transaction descriptions in the statement raw data file that we will need to change for our 8/15/22 Visa statements.

This is the current mapping for the transaction descriptions:



There are some accounts that will have a description noted after a payment. We dont want this description listed after payment, we only want it to list Payment.
<Transaction AmountType="Credit">

 <FeatureName>Purchases</FeatureName>

 <MerchantCategoryCode>6012</MerchantCategoryCode>

 <ChannelType>ExternalInteractive</ChannelType>

 <TransactionType>Payment</TransactionType>

 <TransactionDate>6/7/2022</TransactionDate>

 <PostingDate>6/7/2022</PostingDate>

 <EffectiveDate>6/7/2022</EffectiveDate>

 <Amount>-2501.68</Amount>

<Description>Highest rate payment applied to PrincipalDebit transactions.</Description>

 <DescriptionSummary>Payment</DescriptionSummary>

There are also some accounts that will have a description noted for the periodic finance charge. We dont want this description listed after the periodic finance charge, we only want it to list PeriodicFinanceCharge


</Transaction>

 <Transaction AmountType="Debit">

 <FeatureName>Purchases</FeatureName>

 <MerchantCategoryCode>6012</MerchantCategoryCode>

 <ChannelType>Batch</ChannelType>

 <TransactionType>PeriodicFinanceCharge</TransactionType>

 <TransactionDate>6/9/2022</TransactionDate>

 <PostingDate>6/15/2022</PostingDate>

 <EffectiveDate>6/15/2022</EffectiveDate>

 <Amount>1.26</Amount>

<Description>DaysInPeriod=31; Balance=115.00; Rate(APR)=12.900000; Rate(Daily)=0.035342</Description>

 <DescriptionSummary>PeriodicFinanceCharge</DescriptionSummary>

Here is a snip of the payment with the black line through what we don't want to print on the statement.

project WECUMV11.zip is in qa folder.

Parallel id:20220712084839

This is simple update of removing verbiage from description whenDescriptionSummary isPeriodicFinanceCharge orPayment. I think we don't need dpvs or index file for that.



checklist attached.

Following code has been rolled back. You may need to change status from "DONE" to something like "in progress". So that you will remember to release again.
