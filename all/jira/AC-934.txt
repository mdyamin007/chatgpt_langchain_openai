Document verbiage update: Before > After
 * Member > Account
 * Visa Credit Card > Credit Card
 * Home Equity > Home Equity
 * Loan Statement > Loan
 * Screenshot of current verbiage on eSite

*Details*: Update tab names on member site.Update tab names on admin site (this should also update email template names). This would require code updates and server restarts since their member and admin sites are still on prism/older application. Based on that, here are the hours and tentative timeline below:

Note: The email template names would also change, therefore just an fyi the client may want to update the subject lines accordingly to match. For example they want the 'Visa Credit Card' app to change to 'Credit Card' but their credit card email template has 'Your SAFE Visa eStatement is now available' as the subject.
