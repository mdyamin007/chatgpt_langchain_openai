So there will 2 messages for monthly statements.

Should we display theGeneral Message #2 first and then theSelective message #1 (Print and Electronic) or vice versa? Will theSelective message #1 (Print and Electronic) need to be displayed in seperate page or it can be in same page with where the statement content ends.



Those are not needed for archival, right ?

The Selective message #1 (Print and Electronic) and General Message can be displayed together or separate.

This was supposed to release today but we got late approval. If by chance qa finished today and this has to be released and we are not available at that moment would it be possible to release it? Parallel id:*20220926031949*



[~barnetts] if Qa gets completed and this has to be released and you can't reach us please would you please ask [~TunA]to help to release it?
