title: 44312 / 11277 - MWCU - XML Statement Format Update - New Default5.JSP
description: Overall here are the area that need to be change from both teams.

1. Account Number to Member Number - ISD Need to make code changes for statement 6/30/2020 forward. This mean we need to create a new JSP (default5.jsp)

2. Add account number for each share/loan section - IS need to add the addition account number in the XML file under share/loan section. ISD may need to update code depending test result.

3. The verbiage on the bottom of the statement also need to be update from IS side as we are getting the old message in the XML file.

PDF show 'Your Merit Rewards ...' but we got 'Relationship Advantage ...' in the XML. ISD do not need to make update in this area.
