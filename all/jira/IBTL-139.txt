comment: [~Velasco]: Per our conversation, please try to run the job not on your remote PC but on the Brisbane Jump Station. I believe the issue is because you SSH timed out for this job. Long processing jobs will disconnect ssh (i think).



Le reported this similar issue in IBTL-67 as well. I re-ran the job since 9:50pm last night and this morning it is still running...I hope it will not break since I'm running on the Brisbane jump station

comment: [~Velasco]: Did BANB EOM finished normally before you tested cycle 9/15? Please advise.


author: velasco
comment: [~William.Kong]No it did not. If failed because of the session timing out. I did not retry since you had a check image/cripple issue in IBTL-143.

Should I try EOM now?


author: william.kong
comment: [~Velasco]: Let's hold off now. Would like YaMee to review the 100% cripple issue on IBTL-143


author: william.kong
comment: [~Velasco]: Please re-test. We re-did the entire preprocessing02 server by cloning the Menlo Preprocessing02. The check image parsing is working now. I did a quick test and it worked:

comment: Anil, can you see why some account got the error message when we try to look it up? I was able to search some and able to view statement. At first when I test 1032, I saw the same error but after few try, I got the account not found. Please check to see if one of the backend server is not working correctly.

1032 - the one that got the error earlier (shouldn't exist)

100450511 - also got the same error earlier but now it work.



Thanks

David

When I searched today's infotrac logs on ca-infotrac-pr-01 machine, I see some account search requests failed. Logs say that connection refused when trying to connect to infoservice URL. Can you check if infoservice common url was down that time or was there any other issue.

Infotrac proxy url is not working and you are working on enabling that (ticket : https://jira.infoimageinc.com/browse/BRIS-240). Mean while, I have asked Neil to use[http://ca-infotrac-pr-01.infoimageinc.com:8380/login.do]direct url to access site. But he is not able to access site. Does he need any port access to access site?
