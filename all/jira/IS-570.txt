Got it. I will use the new logo.

comment: In progress.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~andyp] Please keep this on HOLD again; a recent DPVS from another programmer showed that the color is still bad on the new TIFF logo.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~andyp] We have finally received the corrected logo from the final test print. I have attached here - when possible, please update for a new DPVS.

For now, I will be updating the live date to 4/22/22, but will confirm with IS managers and QA.
