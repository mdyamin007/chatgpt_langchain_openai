title: SUCU - Updates to COOP Return File to Include Changes Only
description: 

Update DefaultReportGenerator for the COOP Report to extends from the ContinuousReportRegistrar (this will utilize the p_job_time table).

Update the ExtIdMappingReportStrategy to filter out records that have paperless modified date older than the last processed time recorded in the p_job_time table.

--Probably will need to update the Stategy to accept the Registrar as a reference, so that it can access certain values such as the p_job_time that's obtained.

 

3 hours programming. 

Note that an initial p_job_time need to be inserted into the database, and the last processed time cannot be null (this is how the ContinuousReportRegistrar is implemented).

comment: [~lina] Test file is approved; please prepare for release - this has to be released on 3/7/22 so that the report begins generating as of 3/8/22. I'll update the live date accordingly.

comment: Hi @Phoebe,

The client's last COOP report was on 01/12.

The test report covered 01/12 - 02/23.

I am assuming that the test report was just a test and the next COOP report generated on 03/08 should cover 01/12 - 03/08?

Thanks.
Lin

comment: [~lina] [~Tin.Chak] For the first file, it should be a fll file from 1/12 - 3/8 data. Then starting 3/9, it will be back to the 'partial' file that will just include changes. 



Please confirm we can release no later than 3/7/22 for the CU's re-launch.

It will be released by 03/07 and the first report will be generated on 03/08.

How often should this report be ran?

Regards.

comment: [~lina] Thanks for the update! The file should run daily (Mon - Sun) at 2pm PST. It should get copied to the FTP client pickup folder when ready. No email notification is required when copied. Thank you!

comment: Hi [~phoebe.george],

Can you please confirm that the client does not want to be notified when a new COOP report is available?

The old configuration was that they will be notified via email at dp@sfcu.org.

Thanks.
Lin
