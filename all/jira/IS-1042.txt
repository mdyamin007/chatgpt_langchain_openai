comment: hi [~rukmaniR],



Client approved the files you sent. However they are requesting test files for:

Tax File

Savings File

Loan Statement File


author: JIRAUSER11100
comment: [~MattL] Savings and loan statement files were already placed in client pickup.

Savings: ACBK_Savings_04142022_1_1.zip.pgp
Loan Statement: ACBK_LOAN_04042022_1_1.zip.pgp

I'll talk to YaMee about tax file and get back to you.

Thanks!


author: mattl
comment: Hi [~rukmaniR]I guess they're requesting them to be sent again. Please re-send once you get the tax file.
