comment: [~mamunur.rashid], can you please check TKCU. There is an issue when opening statements/notices it will show an error but if you hit refresh it loads the statement properly. This is present on pilot and stage.

comment: [~Patric K], there was a problem with tkcu_afp2web.pm file in afp2web end. There was a mismatch in that file between 2 servers for tkcu. Afikur fixed it. It's working now. Please check and let us know if you find any other issues.

Thanks
