comment: [~phoebe.george]: The ticket live date is set for 12/31. What should be the correct revised live date for this project so that we can plan the release after ISD addresses their issues. Please allow us 5 days to prep.

[~phoebe.george]: This ticket date is still past due. We cannot have a floating date as this month is very tied up. We need at least two weeks advance notice.
