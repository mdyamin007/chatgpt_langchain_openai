title: EQBK - Console Log Error Removal - Errors on Disclosure Page and during SSO Enrollment
description: The Disclosure and Account Reconciliation tabs have console errors. (We probably should check the other clients, too, if these tabs were skipped).



Also, during SSO enrollment Step 2 of 3, when the user click Accept, for a brief moment a console error occurs regarding some missing "validate function.

The Disclosure tab and Reconciliation tab leads to two pages that also have console errors. (We probably should check the rest of the clients if these were skipped).

Also, during SSO Enrollment Step 2 of 3, when the Accept button is clicked, there is a console error during the transition logic. For a brief moment, I see a complaint about some missing "validate" function.

Thanks,
Tai
