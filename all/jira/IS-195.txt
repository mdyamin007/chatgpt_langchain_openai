comment: [~kdishroon]: Live Date is set for 7/19/2021. Look like we need to have time to run parallel to test the resources and the positioning of the address. Does this have to go live by Monday? If so, we need to rush and get client approval and kick off parallel ASAP. please advise.


author: william.kong
comment: [~kdishroon]: Look like the live date is today. We still have not received approval and start parallel. Today's live date is not achieved. We will need to reschedule the live date as soon as client provide approvals.

comment: Verified new address on eNotices. Address is changed correctly.

I don't see any statements to verify address. The index file was already processed.

Do I need to verify address on statements?

comment: [~nprimak],

This updateis for wfcuml1- Mortgage. I think the previous index file need to be taken down and repost with new one. Any account should show the new PO box.
