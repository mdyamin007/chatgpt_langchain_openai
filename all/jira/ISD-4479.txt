title: 14010 / 48389 - WECU - Enable Popup Alert
description: Enotice and undeliverable pop up:

InfoTRAC:
- Enable pop up alerts tab in Client Management
- Set up pop up alerts by going to the pop up alert tab and selecting everything that should have pop ups (types of enotices and undeliverable).

Hypercube code:
- Add "popupAlert": true in properties.json
- Edit popupAlert.html

Enotice:
 * Post enotice index file
 * Change enotice stamp to before today and change viewed to N
 * Login and pop up should show
 ** Used cif: 12345, acct400837467 / type NA, acct0810095114 / DD --change sesslastlogin to 1/1/19 and pop up should appear for estmt, enotice, and etax.

Undeliverable:
 * Make updates to code and conf file before proceeding:
 ** Addbounceback flags to invalidate email address to status B
 ** Code update to upload2/bouncebackReport/ReportGenerator in processing-ui core code. (see pilot)
 * Post an ms1 index file with at least 11 entries
 * Change an email for one acct to the bad email address, and the rest to my own
 * Trigger emails, 10 should be successful and 1 should get bounced
 * Trigger bounceback report, should update the email valid status to B
 * Login with the bad email address and undeliverable should show
 ** cif876694 should have both undeliverable and stmt pop up (if sesslastlogin is changed to something like 8/1/20)

Update: Client requested verbiage changes to the pop-ups, located in client/views/popupAlert/popupAlert.html
 * Enotice popup
 ** -Change to Unviewed Document(s)-
 ** -You have *the* following unviewed document(s)-
 ** -Remove 'Click on Dismiss button below to go to view your document'-

* Undeliverable popup
** Add a line of white space before Unviewed Document(s)
** Change entire verbiage to: "We haven't been able to send you notification emails, which may be because we have an outdated email address. The email address we have on file is: [insert email]. To update it, close this window and click on Statement Options."

To do: 
Find out why emails are not working on stage.
Test if bad email is flagged as bounced, and if so run bounceback report to check that the bad email gets invalidated properly.

comment: Application pop up works on pilot. Testing bounced email sending and added bounceback invalidate flags to edit the np record valid status, currently pending email job to finish before running bounceback report.

author: shun.kuwashima
comment: Pending new due dates


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: Due dates updated to 7/23. Client approved initial popup functionality, but they still need to check the verbiage updates. They used the wrong email address so the undeliverable popup did not show on pilot, having them try again.


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: Client requesting more changes:
- There is a space between the email address and the period.
- Add the word 'the' before 'Statement Options'.
- Add a line of white space between the Unviewed Documents and the previous verbiage.
