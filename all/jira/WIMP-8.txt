comment: Joe is looking at alternative solution from iText API.

4/15:  Joe found another API/Tool for Ernest to evaluate last week.  Ernest had not have a chance to review.  Post AFPOSE.

4/29:  Ernest still has not had an opportunity to review the PostAFPose

5/13:  Per Joe, Rose asked to put this project ON-HOLD.

7/1:  Will wait for Eric/Rose to give us official decision to keep this project on hold or cancel it permanently. 8/12: Per Eric this is highly competitive product. Rose will put on hold to EOY.
