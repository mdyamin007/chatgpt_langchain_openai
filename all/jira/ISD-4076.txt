*estmtselinsert*this flags inserts a message inside a statement file at a specific position with predefined height and width. when you click on a monthly document you will be able to see this message in that document. In the prism front end, we show the*Insert*column in the prism front end based on a different process which is the *insert process*.As far as I have seen in the database, DB values are in the Database so you should have been able to see the messages in the monthly documents.

Can you confirm which one you can't see on the front end?

Thanks,

I posted last week on pilot and checked some accts... and it seems the eselective insert is missing (see image). Beyond the*afp.default.estmtselinsert=true* flag what else is needed to enable this feature for HTBK?
