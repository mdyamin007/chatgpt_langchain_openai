comment: Hi [~jun],

The new samples looks the same as the first one; can you make sure you attached the correct revised sample? Just to clarify, the client is looking to have the same amount of white space on all 4 sides of the logo.

The new tif resource look very similar to previous one. I only noticed the font of the logo is bolder than the previous one.


author: kdishroon
comment: [~jun] Can you reduce the logo size so that there is equal white space around it?


author: jun
comment: [~kdishroon],

Attached new pdf samples with smaller logo and more white space.

comment: [~kdishroon]: Please note we cannot release project today. Too many last minute changes. We will need to revisit the next code release date after 11/3 of next week and assuming we get their approvals early next week.





BTW, [~jun]does not see the revised logo attachment from your comment above. Please attach logo to ticket. [~jun]will 'try' to work on it later this afternoon if time permits.
