title: Afp2Web Issue/notifyservice auto start issue
description: *afp2web*

When we reboot afp2web VMs (ca-afp2web-pr-01/02) and check the docker process for afp2web, it seems to be running, but actually the afp2web service is down. You have to manually stop and start the docker instance to make it work. For docker, do we need any auto startup script ? We have a property alwaysrestart if we set this to true will the docker be automatically started up reboot



*Notifyservice*

When network brought back theBrisbaneservers this morning, I have seen that notifyservice on ca-infotrac-pr-01/02 did not start automatically. But when I did a reboot of the VM, the docker instances for notifyservice got started  need to test this multiple times to make sure the docker instances start upon reboot
