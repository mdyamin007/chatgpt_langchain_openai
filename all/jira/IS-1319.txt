What letter do you have for 50?


author: JIRAUSER11101
comment: [~Kbittmann] 
Please check the IS-1050. That's the mortgege_dq letter


author: JIRAUSER10911
comment: [~zhuoxinT]

Okay. Please move letter to 51.


author: JIRAUSER10911

The client would like to confirm the below. Please advise.

1) Prior to encrypting AutoTitle.MMDD file so it becomes AutoTitle.MMDD.pgp, what file type are you expecting (.txt using pipe delimiter, .csv using comma delimiter)?

2) Since we are asking for archival, what file name should we expect to get back from you? Also, what content, if any, should we expect?


author: JIRAUSER11101
comment: [~Kbittmann] 
 1. AutoTitle.MMDD.pgp is good. we don't need any extension like other data file name for wfcudla.

2. We will generate and drop to client pick up folder:
 the file name is followed what we have right now. 
 'ATR' can be changed,
 LOANID is from data file.

the pdf naming convention:*WFCU_ATR_\{LOANID}_\{SEQ_NUM}.pdf*
 index file : *WFCU_{color:#ff0000}ATR{color}_index_mmddyyyy-\{SEQ_NUM}.txt*

The pdf and index files will be zipped up inWFCU_Adv_Letter_mmddyyyy_\{SEQ_NUM}.zip with all other pdf files.

No new updates. Are you needing to confirm something?

comment: [~Kbittmann] 
If client is good with the above setting, I think we can move to QA.
