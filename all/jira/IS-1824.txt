It will be with their daily notice file.  I am going to have a call with them to go over the questions that Tun asked of them and will be able to clarify that and get a new test file tomorrow.

We are going to have to place this request on hold, despite best efforts client is waiting on an IT resource to create a test file.  Once client is able to obtain the new test file, I will request an updated timeline.
