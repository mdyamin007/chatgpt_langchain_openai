title: WTCU - Backbase API Setup Specs Doc through Trexis
description: Request for Auth doc only for WTCU API setup for Trexis/Backbase development and testing.


author: tai.trinh
comment: double check the official name for the vendor, whether it's trexis or backbase and use one of the two

comment: I let Ethan know via spark that we should use Backbase, as Trexis is a 3rd party vendor that is doing the coding for the API.

[~Ethan.Yu] please confirm if the Auth doc will be ready today, we had notified Trexis that this would be available by 11/5 and so we are behind a day. Thank you!

comment: [~Ethan.Yu] WTCU has approved testing for the API setup; can you confirm next steps to proceed with our code release? Let me know target date and/or lead time. I'm also waiting to hear back from the CU on what date they would like to target for release. Thanks!
