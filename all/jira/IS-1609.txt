comment: [~albertM]the data file attached

[^LN6660p_HBT.txt]

is missing the end of line data we discussed in the turn over meeting. Is this correct?


author: JIRAUSER11504
comment: Which end of line data? It seems to match my specifications document and mapping.


author: JIRAUSER11003
comment: [~albertM]I thought at the end of the line there was information about the record !image-2022-09-29-09-51-24-750.png|width=693,height=273!

comment: Many / most of the Loan Bills have a control information out there. That does not apply to the the Escrow Analysis.

As far as I can tell the specifications document, mapping and sample data files are all complete, consistent and do not reference that. 


author: JIRAUSER11003
comment: [~andreav] [~albertM]I will have a sample ready later today for review with the new datafile

Please review so I can make changes as needed. I will work on providing a larger sample set. I still have a lot of back end work before we can process


author: andreav
comment: New logo attached. Please include in next set of samples and also provide the dpvs so I can ship physical samples to client for approval.

Updated sample: [^hrtbes1-1.pdf]

Please provided feedback so I can make changes before print samples are sent to client.

comment: [~jasonV] - Here is my feedback:
- Logo color is incorrect, too blue. See snippet of logo from Notices. Please get from DSI using same size and position. Date sits too close to the return address so hopefully logo sizing will help this.

- Font is not correct, looks too narrow. See snippet from Loan Stmts:
 !screenshot-2.png|thumbnail! 
- Account number on top right should be masked: Show last 4 digits, use 4 preceding digits. If less than 4 digits, use zero filler.

comment: [~andreav] [~albertM]Please print the first 3 accounts first (12 pages) and review before we send to client.

comment: [~jasonV] - The sample still shows the incorrect logo color and font. Did you send me the most updated samples?


author: JIRAUSER11003
comment: [~andreav]is the logo correct now

author: andreav
comment: [~jasonV] - See my feedback below:
# Logo color is still off. It should be like a forest green and larger like on the Daily Notices. 
# Also, the font is still not right. 
# Not sure if Al told you but the address block should be in the same case as it comes in the data file. The sample you provided shows all upper case. 

See snaphshot comparing to a Daily Notice sample for reference on how the color and font should look.

comment: I messaged Tanmay to provide. I guess he'll provide tonight. 


author: JIRAUSER11504
comment: The masking of the account number is the wrong style. it should be four X and four digits. The digits need to be zero filled in case of a short account number. You might be able to copy code from any of the HRTB Loan Statements.

 The MICR line spacing needs to be adjusted. I am sending an email with feedback from HRTB on loan statements that has images showing what is needed.
