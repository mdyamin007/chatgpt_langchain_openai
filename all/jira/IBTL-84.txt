comment: [~hkhosravani] & [~Peter.Dang]: The share and ftpbu drive are not connected. Does any of the scripts from ISWK read from these directories? Please advise which script is reading from these directories missing.



[~hkhosravani]: Can you clarify what you mean on SUNW? I just check Menlo and Brisbane the D:\sunwym1 folder is present. Please where is sunw is missing so that I can research further.

comment: [~hkhosravani]: I'm not able to create \\dell-2100\share\ on this ca-ritan-pr-01 box. The issue is that the temporary 10.4.32.6 is not really "dell-2100". This server has to be labeled as "dell-2100" in order for me to mount. 

For now, i will consider this testing an exception. By the time of the conversion weekend, we are going to+move+ our Menlo Park Dell-2100 server and the ISWK servers over to brisbane.
