comment: [~kericapote] I've seen this issue before in past tickets, I believe PC needs to enable ejob tracking on stage in order to see the tabs in job status. Can you confirm with them on this?

comment: [~gthillaivel] PC enabled ejob tracking.  Let me know if you can see it now.
Thanks, Shun!

All/Paper/Estmt tabs are displayed now. Status of e-stmt is still running, does not display the completed status

comment: [~kericapote] Seems like they never had the configuration set up to show estatement job details on job status (even on production). I had to enable a Mail tracking configuration on infotrac settings to resolve the above. Not sure if we bill them for this, but I enabled it on stage only in the meantime so that QA can proceed with verifying this if necessary.

[~gthillaivel] Estatement job should be showing as completed now, I had to enable a configuration and repost the index file.
