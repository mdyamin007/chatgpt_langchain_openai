/d/Iswk/afp2web_v2.1b10/*bbbbys1* folder.

/z/Iswk/afp2web_v2.1b10/*bbbbys1* folder.



Can you see why we don't have this in Menlo Data Center today?

comment: [~hkhosravani] and [~Peter.Dang]: Can you update the afp2pdf_report_handler.py in the "Menlo Park" DataCenter code today and release tomorrow into parallel & Production? Once released, then let me know. I need to "manually" sync the code from "Menlo Park" to Brisbane since we've+temporarily+ disabled sync.

comment: [~hkhosravani]: My apologies!!!! Literally at 11am, Network team informed me that we no longer should use:



msgps, but instead use ca-msgps-pr-01.infoimageinc.com



Can you fix that?
