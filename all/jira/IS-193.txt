comment: [~kdishroon]: Look like the live date is today. We still have not received approval and start parallel. Today's live date is not achieved. We will need to reschedule the live date as soon as client provide approvals.

comment: Hi Jun,

Below is the client's feedback, I know we are only changing the PO Box, but are you are able to adjust or do we need a separate ticket for these?

"Page 8,

comment: Hi [~kdishroon],

As you stated, these are outside the scope of work. If this can be done under 1 hr, we will be make the accommodations.



[~jun]: Can you confirm these changes can be made under 1 hours time? if so, please proceed. If not, please let me and [~TunA]know the amount of additional hours required.  Please reach out to Keri if you need clarification on how the alignment is needed. Also, please let me know when you think you can get this completed so that we can update the live date from 7/19 to 7/___



Ideally, would like to get this approved by Thursday and released by Monday.





Thanks!

 Will

comment: Hi [~William.Kong] [~kdishroon],

There are different "balance types" that show the variable interest rate that are also not aligned. Currently, the sample only show 3 balance types. The data isn't applicable to make the other types to show. Since the data isn't applicable to make all the other types to show, I am thinking I would need to change the conditions to true to make the rate show to verify the alignment, which I think would take a little more time.

The alignment is a quick fix. However, I was wondering should I align the other variable interest rate for the other balance types too?



These are currently showing but no aligned:
*STD_PUR_APR*: V580_F90 == 1
*STD_CASH_APR*: V580_F94 == 1
*STD_BAL_XFER_AP*R: V582_F75 == 1

Data not application so not showing:
*PRO_PURCH3*: NOT EMPTY(V580_F75) AND V580_F92 == 1
*PRO_CASH_ADV*3: NOT EMPTY(V580_F77) AND V580_F96 == 1
*PRO_BAL_XFER3*: FOUND_582 == 1 AND V582_F77 == 1
*PRO_PURCH*: NOT EMPTY(V580_F76) AND V580_F93 == 1
*PRO_ADV*: NOT EMPTY(V580_F78) AND V580_F97
*PRO_BAL_XFER*: FOUND_582 == 1 AND V582_F78 == 1
*PRO_XFER_5*: FOUND_582 == 1 AND V582_F79 == 1
