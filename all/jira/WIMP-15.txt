comment: 12/16:  As discussed today.  Let's move forward with training regardless if Ron has a live client to demo in Texas Prisma server.

comment: Will, would you come up with a date for the training? I am open to any date, it depends on the staff schedule.

comment: Monday, December 23 since most people will be here before Christmas and I don't want this to go into Tax season.



Please schedule meeting globally for IS using the outlook calendar and finding the best spot with the least amount of conflicts.



I would like Diego & Enrico to be there too.
