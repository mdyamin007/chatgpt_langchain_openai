comment: [~nischala.manjunath] I know you're very busy, wanted to confirm if you are still on schedule to provide a DPVS for this?

Let me know if you can use the latest 9/30 (10/1 production) file for your DPVS test. Thanks!


author: nischala.manjunath
comment: [~phoebe.george] - Yes, I'm working it now and will be able to provide the DPVS by EOD. Found the 09/30 file, will use it for testing. Thanks!


author: nischala.manjunath
comment: [~phoebe.george] - DPVS is attached  [^brilms1130.print]. File - brilms11304.2o1.afp, image range: 281 - 304, accounts: 139 - 146. Thanks!

comment: [~phoebe.george] - PDF archival sample is attached  [^BRIL_DDA_Archival_09302022_1.zip]. Thanks! 


author: phoebe.george
comment: Thanks Nischala, I will confirm once approved.

Also I moved the live date to 11/9 (for now), as I don't believe we'll make the 10/31 date, and I need to review QA times with Igor since they are pretty backed up too. Thanks!


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~nischala.manjunath] The PDF archival samples are approved; the bank confirmed that they were able to load the file successfully into their archival system, so this part is approved. Thanks!

Still waiting for the DPVS samples for QA and shipping to customer though for final approval.

comment: Hi Nischala, print samples are good/approved.

I have also attached the hard copies here and sample tap test that passed.

Please proceed with next steps. Thanks!

author: phoebe.george
comment: [~Igor.Khosid] Can you confirm on this one also, as I want to confirm if you had started this, or if you need to review with me. I thought on our last call you said almost done, but please confirm. Thanks!
