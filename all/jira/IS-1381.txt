Sample is due to client for 8/9 but I heard that that will be a public holiday and DSI will be out of office. Can you please confirm sample will be ready in time? Thanks!

Per client:

One last question. Can you ask this to your team.

I see in the statement the interest rate now shows 0.020%

The request to show the interest rate as is. It should not be rounding up or down.

Is this correct?

Please provide update, thank you!


author: anwarh
comment: Hi [~Bryanl],

We are not doing any rounding. '0.020%' is coming from the data itself.

For example, if I modify the data as '0.029' it shows up correctly.

Also, as the due date is over, can you please let us know a new live date for this?
