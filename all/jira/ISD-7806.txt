comment: [~phoebe.george] We already have enotice setup on our end. Mainly we just need to add a new prefix dnb and the letter code/description, so it's mostly adding configurations and verifying that the index files from the client can post successfully.

[~rifat.mahmud] In addition to the new prefix and letter code, we would also need to add the filename convention star_dnb_yyyymmdd_n.zip.pgp to the scanner so it recognizes the file.

Test file is in /d/FTPBU/ftpbu/starbu/test/dnb_20220913_1_20220913_1223_star.txt, please try posting on pilot.

comment: [~rifat.mahmud] Please confirm target pilot site date for loading the dnb test file.

[~Tin.Chak] FYI

Thanks!

I posted that file on pilot. But for every line in that file ImageCount was set to 0. That's why it failed.

Please provide me with the correct file. Prefix dnb is set on pilot.

comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] Per my zoom message, here is the request from Mamun:

I tried to post that file again with imagecount as 1. But I noticed that there is no associated zip file in pui-pilot server. Could you please ask Shun to place necessary file in pui server?


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~phoebe.george] [~mamunur.rashid] I was able to repost the index file successfully on pilot.

Mamunur, I think you should also have been able to run the test zip file through our internal pilot scanner. I believe that should take care of everything including folder creation/file placement and posting.

comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] Thank you!

[~mamunur.rashid] It posted successfully to pilot, but can you update the Notice Description to: Digital Wallet Notification

Once updated, I will have STAR review pilot and update the image count as well. Thanks!

I have updated the enotice description for PUI.

Is it necessary to update the entoice tab name in Infotrac and infoservice-jaas?


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~mamunur.rashid]The InfoTrac pilot site is still showing the descriptions as 'NA' - does the name have to be updated for InfoTrac pilot separately?

comment: [~phoebe.george] I checked just now and I can see the description on infotrac pilot:

[~mamunur.rashid] I don't think you need to update the tab name unless instructed otherwise by Phoebe.

comment: [~mamunur.rashid] [~Tin.Chak] STAR has opted to setup this dnb notice for print as well. So we will be cancelling this as a separate e-only application and will be adding this notice for print/elec to a Phase 2 for the current print notices that are in progress for setup now.
