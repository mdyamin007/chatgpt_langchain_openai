The CreditDebitIndicator field is empty in the data file. It would only display if it's D or C

In such a case, it may be possible to exclude these records (if 'CreditDebitIndicator' is empty) from Transaction Active.


author: diegof
comment: This only happens when displaying the beginning balance and ending balance. Otherwise it always has the "C" or "D".
