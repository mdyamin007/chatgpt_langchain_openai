title: UTCU - [29174][pvt] UTCU - New CD rate
description: We have 2 classifications of CDs with 13 line items each on them.  The updated form that we sent on 5/13 has extra lines to accommodate for the new certificate (22 month) that we added in May.  I pulled the maturity file that we sent over on 6/2 and have copied it here with the highlighted new CD.  There are 13 lines per classification also in the maturity document.
