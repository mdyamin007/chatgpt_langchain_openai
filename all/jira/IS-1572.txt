comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] Hello Stephen, I finished writing and testing the code needed to send the dpvs. The block of code is located in the sefcml5_processing.sh from line 432 -439.

Testing method:
1. Created a dpvs file containing 
this is a test dpvs for sefc ml5 auto script

-- delete this when finish testing --

2. comment out every other section irrelevant to the test and run the script in rhs
The result is:
!sefc_dpvs_testing.PNG|thumbnail! 

Please review this script and let me know if it's ready for QA. Thank you!

comment: Hi,



Can you please send me the dpvs to review? stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com


author: terrence.tong
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] Sorry for the delay, I had to make some last-minute changes to the script using Tanmay's script. The updated script and dpvs are available for review. The code can be located from lines 432 - 439.


author: terrence.tong
comment: [~tanmay] Please let me know if I can use parallel id: 20220825070255 to release the code. Thank you!

comment: [~OIR]- Looks good!

comment: [~tanmay] Did you release the code?


author: tanmay
comment: No that one is still parallel testing, after passing we will release .

Did you merge your code in parallel , i dont see your code in parallel. Please let me know




author: terrence.tong
comment: [~tanmay] The code is merged and updated using parallel id: 20220825070255. I forgot to mention that Stephen looked at the code last time and he said it's good. Please release the code once you're ready, thank you!


author: terrence.tong
comment: [~Igor.Khosid] There are no changes to the DFA, dpvs, etc. The script is updated to send the dpvs to the client once it's available. Please let me know if there's anything else that you need to look at. 

Here is a snippet of the change from sefcml5_process.sh (line 432 - 439):

fn="${working_dir}/${cid}${jid}${g_segment}${cycle_no}"

if [ -e ${fn}.print ]; then
    subject="SEFC Monthly Loan - cycle ${cycle_no}"
    message="SEFC: Monthly Loan DPVS for cycle ${cycle_no} is ready"
    python ${home_master}/master/daily_mail.py 0 "${subject}" "${message}" ${maillist_external} "${fn}.print"
    echo "done sending email"
fi

QA is completed.
 The script is updated.

Wilson Yu a couple of questions:
{quote} - you also changed *sefcml5_mail.lis* (adding the new parameter "test=Wilson.Yu@infoimageinc.com"), will you keep those changes?
 - in addition, the file (*/home/test/master/daily_mail.py*) has been changed (new verbiage has been added to the body of the letter), will you send these changes to Prod?{quote}

Thanks.

comment: [~Andrey.Kutsenko] 
1. -I don't plan on removing it since it doesn't cause any issues.- Updated the maillist and removed test email
2. I didn't make any changes to /home/test/master/daily_mail.py, where did you see that?


author: JIRAUSER11104
comment: Hi [~OIR] (Wilson Yu).
 [~terrencet], fyi

1. You didn't fix this file on Prod:
{code:sh}
[oper1@rhs ~]$ cat /home/keep/maillist/sefcml5_mail.lis
internal_maillist=infoimage@sefcu.com,dp@infoimageinc.com,daphne.yuen@infoimageinc.com
external_maillist=infoimage@sefcu.com,dp@infoimageinc.com,daphne.yuen@infoimageinc.com
test=Wilson.Yu@infoimageinc.com{code}
2. On the Parallel the file (/home/test/master/daily_mail.py) has been changed. New verbiage has been added to the body of the letter (see screenshot):
 !scr_determine_content.png|thumbnail!
{code:sh}
[oper1@rhs ~]$ diff /home/master/daily_mail.py /home/test/master/daily_mail.py
