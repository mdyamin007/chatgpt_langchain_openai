comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid]

There is an issue in grouping the insert. Previously for household accounts ( multiple accounts in one envelope) insert was not grouped correctly and for that reason, not a single household account got the insert.

Take a look at the production paper txt file for hvy:

!image-2022-08-19-14-01-46-132.png|width=1087,height=236!

see those first household accounts from line 1-6, only the first line has 11 which mentions bin3, and bin4 but for the rest of the lines from 2-6, the field is empty. Since those accounts are grouped that 11 should pass through each account, meaning since lines 1-6 are household the insert value should be the same for all these lines. But since this is not happening in production not a single household customers are getting insert.



We updated the code to resolve this. Here is a snapshot from hvy paper txt file:

!image-2022-08-19-14-08-44-045.png!

now the insert no is same 11 for all household lines.



I am attaching both hvy paper file from production and parallel if you want to take a look.



The best way to test this is to print the dpvs to check if insert gets pulled for household accounts.



dpvs:[^oscums2131.print]from hvy print page 17-29, 253-271 and please check if insert 3,4 get pulled for first range and insert 3 gets pulled for the last range.

Test result (grouping the inserts) - *PASSED*.
 Checked - line2-7; line93-104 in file:
{code:java}

Print samples ( [^IS-1428_OSCU_PrntSmpls_08232022.pdf] ) look good.

[~rony] please attach IS checklist if needed.
