title: GCBK - Mobile ui color off iPhone
description: Hi Shahadet,

The client told us the dropdown for account number list for iPhones are different colors. Can you look into this?

Attached is a screen shot of the dropdown where it says "Checking - XXXX48474". You can see the difference from my testing on pilot on an iPad.

comment: Hi[~Bryant.Tran],
In gcbk, the account type in statement page account dropdown and in profile page wasn't matching for acct_type NA. In statement page, it was showing "null" and in profile page, it was showing "unknown". I have set "unknown" for both of the pages. Please let me know should i keep it like this or as before.I have also fixed some responsive issues for iphone.

thanks,
Moshiur

I tried testing on pilot and I do see the change working, but I do not see the caret (triangle). I think it is because of the"-webkit-appearance: none;" code added to the acctNum.jspf.

*before with caret in red:*
