comment: [~ernestw]: Can you help me review this error on ca-isis-pr-03 (rhs2) 10.4.20.40?

Is the error because you own this file on /d/temp/:

comment: [~lemoy28]: Do you know where in the code is breaking? so that I can research further?

I noticed eStatement zip files were created: /z/isd_input/indiv_afp/apcu/afp-archive/apcums2-20200831/:

I also found the following message in /z/apcu/apcums21318.log

2020-09-08/12:05:35.216 000001/000002 PPCS0026F Unhandled signal 10/'HANGUP' will be ignored.    [pcsdll/pcssig.cpp,102]


author: william.kong
comment: [~ernestw]: Per my spark message, can you review the "HANGUP" error to see if indeed it is a real issue?



[~lemoy28]: Can you confirm if the archival completed or not completed even with this error message?



For now, I will keep this ticket assigned to me.

comment: Hi Will,

The process was incomplete. No pdfs were created.


author: ernestw
comment: According to the log, the processing did finish normally and the full afp was generated. Not sure why it has "Read from remote host 10.4.20.40: connection reset by peer. Connection to 10.4.20.40 closed" when 10.4.20.40 is the ip for rhs2. The connection message was not from Papyrus.


author: lemoy28
comment: Per Ernest, he cannot find the error code in the Papyrus error code reference for "PPCS0026F Unhandled signal 10/'HANGUP' will be ignored." that appears in /z/apcu/apcums21318.log on 10.4.20.40

comment: [~lemoy28]: i got further per our spark.. i didn't change anything other than delete the cksum record in /home/test/keep/cksum_log/ . 

The new error is missing/z/Iswk/afp2web_v2.1b10/apcums2. So I created the folder in both Menlo Park and Brisbane rhs2 server. 

Looks like it is running pdf conversion now..

After process is completed, the file will move to /z/download/apcu/STA.5A.083120.zip.pgp

comment: [~lemoy28]: The program ran past through archival and error out on missing client_pickup directory. I created it just now, but I think the program is runnable and did not disconnect with connection issue. Please QA the results for me:

comment: [~lemoy28]: I've been processing since last night at about 9:50pm and this morning I checked that it is still running.




author: william.kong
comment: [~lemoy28]: It finished. Can you check the results?

Also, can you run this in Menlo Parallel on RHS2 as well.

#1. Run:



echo 'start time' >> /d/iss/apcu_ms2_benchmark.txt; echo `date` >> /d/iss/apcu_ms2_benchmark.txt; /home/test/master/apcums2_process.sh 1 bypass;echo 'finish time' >> /d/iss/apcu_ms2_benchmark.txt; echo `date` >> /d/iss/apcu_ms2_benchmark.txt;

Please share the results.



Here's the benchmarking time from last nights re-run:

Start time: Fri Oct 15 10:00AM

Finish Time:

Fri Oct 16 09:21:02 PDT 2020





#2 Review the results from what I finished this morning on Brisbane RHS2





#3. Run AFPcompare between Menlo & Brisbane again.
