Please upload the attached index files to pilot.

[^ml5_12312019_1_20211214_1643_ewbb.txt]is for 1098 Taxes and [^ml6_01272020_1_20211214_1654_ewbb.txt]is for 1099-INT Taxes.

These index files were produced from parallel environment with the staging DT_JOB_ID rather than on pilot, but it should be good.

Thanks!

The ml5 and ml6 index files are on DOC file format. Currently P-UI don't have support on P-UI to process etax files on DOC.

P-UI needs the etax index files to be on ETaxData3 format.



Thank you.

I have manually copied over the folders containing the zip files from /_z/isd_input/indiv_afp/ewbb/afp-archive/_ to _/z/isd_input/indiv_afp/ewbb/etax/afp-archive/_.

I have not yet made the changes to the processing script to reflect this as there may be conflicts in the zip file folder naming convention between the ewbbyt tax applications and this ewbbml etax (e.g.1098-[closing_date]-[segment] ) as a 1098 and 1099INT exist in both applications. Per Tai, we may need to designate special segments to make the zip file folder names unique  will discuss this with Peter/Tun/Pheobe.

In the meantime, please try to post.

Thanks!

[^etax_1099INT_01272020_1_12252021_160607_ewbb.txt](ml6) is posted successfully.

[^etax_1098_12312019_1_12252021_154532_ewbb.txt](ml5) is not posted. The date format in the zip file name and also the afp file names inside the zip are not in correct format. The date format should be "MMddyyyy" instead of "yyyyMMdd".



Thanks

comment: [~Azad] We have finally received final approval on the pilot site for all of the ML applications - I'll update the remaining tickets, but wanted to let you know in the meantime. I'm meeting with the IS programmers today to confirm QA and timeline. Please begin to prepare necessary steps for QA while we finalize a new live date. Thank you!

Are dma([Welcome Letter eNotices|https://jira.infoimageinc.com/browse/ISD-5852])and etaxes(this ticket) included in ML applications? Or by ML applications, you mean the ml1([Mortgage eStatements|https://jira.infoimageinc.com/browse/ISD-5853]),ml2([ARM eNotices|https://jira.infoimageinc.com/browse/ISD-5854])and ml4([Escrow Analysis eStatements|https://jira.infoimageinc.com/browse/ISD-5855])only?

Thanks

comment: [~Azad] I noted on a separate Jira ticket, but EWBB had previously approved the pilot site.

QA is in progress on the IS story. Please prepare your items in preparation for parallel testing, I'll be submitting this once QA is completed.

I will update each of the Jira ISD stories with this same update tied to this project. Thanks!

comment: To QA,

Process _*etax_1099INT_02152021_50_03222022_175632_ewbb.txt*_ to test eTaxes.

Index file and zip file are already on place. Run the job with 'Test' checked to process on test mode.

For testing purpose, Etax process will create account if new.

Thanks!
