# In disclosure in subsection b is *E-Sign*, there wasnt any info about E-sign in the SOW.  so, are we going to provide them this feature? 
# There is *Reconciliation* for this client so I still need that document.
# I  need the confirmation about CIF file and its formate to start auth process.

comment: Hi Abdullah,



Ill ask about questions 1 and 2 and get back to you on those.

For 3, the CIF file is provided in the input/I3/process-files/ffin folder that Joe mentioned up above in the comments.



Let me know if you have more questions. 



Thank you\!

comment: Hi ethan,
The CIF file joe provided doesnt match with any existing auth index file formate. So, I need to know if I have to make a new data class for that or they gonna provide in a file formate that already exists. 
And about those file that joe provided I already ran the script for pre enrolment without any issues so that part is done.
Thanks.

comment: Hi Abdullah,



Attached is the file specs for CIF_FILE formatting. 

We will need to create a new auth file process for them.



Thank you\!

comment: hi Eithen,

is  FFIN going to use NCR?





author: 5ba31365b1a4b82e99864b79
comment: DigitalInsightV1 I believe. Since FFIN is a bank. Is that correct? Q2, and DigitalInsightV1.


author: abdullah.baki
comment: Yes, you are correct its a bank and so far from our analysis from SOW we found Q2& DigitalinsghitV1.  Since you have provided password for NCR,I asked that for confirmation. 



author: 5ba31365b1a4b82e99864b79
comment: Yeah, by NCR we meant digitalnsightv1. Not the ncr sso method.

Thanks\!

Ive committed the hypercube code in the trunk. but I still need the reconciliation as of now I'm showing disclosure in place of reconciliation. if possible I need a logo with proper dimension cause this logo stretched out in hypercube. 
also, do you start working on *infotrac*?




author: 5ba31365b1a4b82e99864b79
comment: Hi Abdulluh, Ill let them know. 

What dimensions does the logo need to be?

Thanks a lot\!

Ive started on InfoTRAC Pilot Env already. It should be set up.

David made me aware that moving forward DSI is supposed to set up InfoTRAC.
