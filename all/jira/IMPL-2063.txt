comment: [~Ricky Lopez] Please check back with Sean on this as he asked if you can create a new story for ISD for him to assign. Please assign to him and ask him if we can still make the pilot for 6/8. Please update Kristi on the team support ticket once the pilot is ready. Just let her know you are assisting while I'm OOO. Thanks!
