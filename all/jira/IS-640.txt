Mahbub--I see only mail code change in the diff( MAIL_CODE = 'M' )

1. Is there any control file changes too for this ticket.?
 !diff_qa.PNG|thumbnail! 

2. Is the Endorsment enabled for the heavy?


author: william.kong
comment: [~andreav]: This project live date is overdue (i.e. 12/3/2021). Can we move this live date to 12/15? I do not want to go past this 12/15 date; Hopefully all the QA issue just reported are resolved timely. Please advise so that we can update this story to manage this project resourcing correctly.



[~tanmay]: Please review feedback from [~gthillaivel]above in her comments.

 1.Previously letter 017 was redirect to file id sm1 that's why we used mail code M. But now we need to redirect it to 5.hvy based on insert bin 2 weight, if any bin weight is greater than 3.295 it will go to 5.hvy . So for that we just need to reset the mail code . so only change in dfa end
 2. yes endorsement enable for heavy
