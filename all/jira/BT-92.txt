comment: Hi [~Andrey.Kutsenko]

Your sso attempt failed because of the password mismatch. The stage Hypercube expects a different password, not the password we sent from the client-test page. This tab is for Pilot only.

I have added a new tab for doing sso on Stage. I've attached an screenshot of that tab.

Also, to perform a client side sso for PFCU, you would need a user_fi_number that has a mapping with accounts which has Escrow Analysis statements processed for them. Use the user_fi_number(cif) *999999*. This cif has mappings with 3 different accounts. 2 of them has escrow analysis statements processed for them and the remaining one does not. So you will not see any escrow statement for that account.

Let me know your feedback.

Thanks

Fixed.
Checked for acct_number(user_fi_number): 2020007494(1004), 10053601(100536), 1000610(10006)
