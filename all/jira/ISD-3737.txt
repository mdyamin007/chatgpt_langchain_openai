About the migration,
 # OSCU eStatment site has a *_Routing number_:_323274270_* hardcoded on the footer. I didn't find any business logic related to it on the ROOT module. I need some clarification about this.
 # OSCU has only one step of enrollment.*Terms & Conditions*and*Email*(Delivery) both are on the same step. We can divide this step into 2 in Hypercube. Will it be fine?

Thanks

After analysis, we found that sso only supports existing user, if cif is not in mapping table, user cannot login. However, there is also a logic on enrollment part, that if account number or cif is not found in DB, then create one, which will not be executed ever as sso is not permitting such accounts.
So we need to confirm if auto_user creation should be on or off.

Also, I asked you about routing number, can you give me any idea on that.

Thanks

I only have the PR I attached in the main ticket.

Hi [~Azad]
 # On Hypercube, I think we have a way to add footer also? I think RWCU has it. Let's just add that verbiage in.
 # Yes, we can split it into two to conform with Hypercube flow.
 # Auto_user creation should be off. The user creation is done through Document Processing with the autoRegister flag on. So they must have a document for them to be able to log in.

Thanks,
Tai

 # OSCU(Prism) has a feature that will send an email notification if the user changes their email address in the Profile page. But Hypercube does not send notification for email address changes it only sends out notification on changing notification type from email to sms or vice versa . What should be done about this?
 # About routing number, what RWCU has, is on the Profile page. Routing number will go in the footer, in Global space. We can do this by adding a new flag in properties.json file. Will it be okay?

Thanks,
 Azad

 # No, just leave this out for now.
 # The routing number can either go in area 1 or area 2. Either is fine. No need to add anything else. It doesn't have to be exactly like Prism.

OSCU(Prism) sends out an email if the Delivery Preference is changed. But Hypercube does not send out email for DP change(Paperless to Paper or vice-versa). What should we do about this feature?

Sorry, I had meant to do some part of this myself, but I do not have the time to.

Please take care of the entire hypercube migration project.

You can work on ISD-3703. There are delays on the client side, so we do not need to rush anything. We have already finished Hypercube anyway and that is the most important thing we need for the client to test SSO when they are able to.

Thanks,
Tai
