comment: [~zhuoxinT]-client has request on date format

Can the date on top right of the letter be spelled out?

Example: instead of 9/22/2022 can it say September 22, 2022.



Can this be done?


author: JIRAUSER11101
comment: [~Ricky Lopez]

comment: Client request:

[~zhuoxinT]Can we spell the date out in the letter? I believe its the 2^nd^line in the first paragraphinstead of x/x/xxx can we spell out like we did at the top.



Thanks,

Ricky

The date in the first paragraph is from the data[^MINOR.LETTER]
Is it possible that client change that?
If they cant, I will need more time on this.
