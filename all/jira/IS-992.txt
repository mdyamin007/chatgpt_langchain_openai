I updated the code in the parallel environment. Can you request DP to process for testing?

The MPT 28374 (UTCU) has been created. Can you please fill out so I can request DP process in parallel ?

Thanks, Barnett

Per our conversation, this job doesn't need a master parallel and you'll request for DP to process.
