comment: Please note, per William, we will need to enable AOLP via InfoTrac for the first cycle only so the bank can review an approve the first set of samples. Please let me know if you need anything. I'll let ISD know they need to turn on as well.

I have posted the *ms3_20220831_1_20221010_2010_west.txt*index file on pilot.

And I used 'saving' as stmt_type, please correct me if I'm wrong.

I'm seeing differences in the pilot vs our version.
