comment: [~eric.yan]: The i3.socket.pl will fail because of the following. The pui-stage.infoimageinc.com is not present. ISD is setting it up this week so I hope this will be made available later.

For now, I will keep this ticket assigned until the server is ready.

comment: [~eric.yan]: Can you re-test this if this program run on RHS? I don't recall which server you tested this. If it is RH2, then let me know because we need to wait and activate the Papyrus license. 

I believe the ISD pui-stage.infoimageinc.com is up now which mean I3socket.pl should be able to communicate. If it still doesn't work, please re-assign to me.
