Attached is an archival sample for balloon file only.

[^RWCU_NOTICES_DLA_Archival_03282022_1.zip.001]

please send this to the customer for approval.



For the other file wcurtchgMMDD there are some changes I see in data file which I think might be issue:
 # No header - previously there was header{color:#4c9aff}Letter Name,Last 4 of Card Number,Primary Cardholder Name,Address ,Address ,City,State,Postal Code,Current Rate,New Rate,Same Rate,Credit Line{color}
 # {color:#172b4d}2nd column is empty{color}
 # {color:#172b4d}PreviouslyCurrent Rate,New Rate,Same Rate had -(minus) and %(percent) sign, but new data doesn't have it.{color}
 # {color:#172b4d}PreviouslyCredit Line column had $(dollar) sign , but new data doesn't have it.{color}
 # {color:#172b4d}I am assuming the last column is now the full account no, why don't client use the same 2nd column for account number instead of last.{color}



I am attaching the new data here( that client attached in ts) if you want to review too.[^rwcudlR.dat]

Let the client know about those issues.

comment: [~rony], please see following response from RWCU:

This is from my programmer after we compared the test file that was sent over and the most recent that we had sent on 3/23:

Comparing the two files:
 * Neither file has a header.
 * Neither file includes negative signs !https://jira.redwoodcu.org/images/icons/emoticons/forbidden.png|width=16,height=16! or percents (%) on the rates.
 * Neither file includes dollar signs ($) on the Credit Lines
 * The 2nd column (last 4 of card number) is blank in both. This is probably a bug. We stopped recording the card number to the loan record in 2017, and didn't update the programming. I can fix it.

When InfoImage is saying the file has changed, are they also actually looking at the files, or are they looking at their documentation/programming?

Please confirm.

Please check these data forwcurtchgMMDD

[^rwcurtchg1114.csv] - old version

[^rwcudlR.dat] - new one provided in ts

Please ignore the file naming (csv vs dat) for now. Just look into the content. You will see the points I mentioned above.

Thanks

comment: Hi [~TunA]

sorry to bother you here. But wanted to share some information about rwcurtchg(R2) file .

I loaded the RWCUDLR2.zip from /d/iss/qa/RWCU/ and when I open the data file it looks like the file has header, percent sign, dollar sign

[^RWCUDLR2.DAT]



!image-2022-04-02-02-11-58-297.png!



And I check out the production dfa from production and there is code that actually ignores the header part .

!image-2022-04-02-02-13-21-099.png!



But now when they are providing new data it looks like this no header, 2nd column is empty where previously account no appeared:

!image-2022-04-02-02-15-03-073.png!

[^rwcurtchg0323.csv]

But when I bring this issue with data file change in comment 1 client's response looks like there were never header before or any dollar or percent sign in this data file. But the current production code will skip 1st record for current data file client is sending.



Would you please provide your comments here.

Since the client does not remember header line, can you please add these line? So we can handle both condition.

Please let me know if you have concern.

Looks like the progress of this task got slow. Would you please ask the client, that data filerwcurtchg will always have the 2nd column empty and the last column is full account no?


author: rony
comment: Hi [~dyuen]

Any update?

Would you please arrange a meeting with you Tun and me. I will shortly discuss the data file issue I am seeing in currentrwcurtchgfile.

comment: Hi [~rony], just an FYI from RWCU:

"We will need to update the programming on our end but the business unit would like to see what the letters look like with the data in the second column empty."

Still pending an update on how to proceed.

Thanks

comment: Hi [~dyuen]

Below is the pdf sample for old data and new data the client sent for this update, generated from the same production code. I also attached the data file so that client can compare data vs output.

[^rwcudlr_new.pdf]data file[^rwcudlR_new.dat]( with no header and 2nd column empty )

[^rwcudlr_old.pdf]data file[^rwcurtchg1114_old.csv]

author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~rony], we're still waiting on an updated test file for the wcurtchgMMDD.csv file. RWCU in the meantime reviewed the balloon archive sample, please see their feedback as follows:

These came through all wrong.

The <Cabinet> should be NOTICES

The <DocName> and <Type> should be BALLOON PAYMENT NOTICE



Please correct and provide a new sample.

Thanks

comment: Hi [~dyuen]

Before doing any archival-related update I want to provide a sample with production code without any change to the code.

[^rwcudlr.pdf]



My findings of the new data:



The header is missing from the data file

_Letter Name,Last 4 of Card Number,Primary Cardholder Name,Address ,Address ,City,State,Postal Code,Current Rate,New Rate,Same Rate,Credit Line_





The *Current Rate, New Rate, and Same Rate* values were with % sign in data file before, but missing in new data.



Anyway please provide the sample to the client for feedback. After that, I will change for archival.



Thanks

Rony

comment: Hi [~rony], sorry I missed this a few days ago. I added the above to the ticket for RWCU to review.

Thanks


author: dyuen
comment: [~rony], please see the following question from rwcu;

"I was just looking at the current file that we send for rwcurtchgMMDD.csv (the last one was rwcurtchg0629.csv) and there were no headers present in that file either nor the two before that.

Do we need to provide headers in the update to this file? The only difference is we are adding the Full Account member account number as the last field."


author: rony
comment: Hi [~dyuen]

Yes, per existing production code data should contain header. But I can modify the code to adjust that so that client doesn't need to add header.

Other than that any feedback about the sample I provided from production code on my previous message?



Thanks


author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~rony], no response yet on that. I followed up.

Thanks


author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~rony], per RWCU: "The samples were good. Let's go ahead and adjust for no headers."

Please confirm once adjusted and if new samples will be provided.

comment: [~rony], please see feedback from RWCU:

"Can we change the XML on this file?

Can we set <DocName> and <Type> toVISA COURTESY CHANGE NOTICE

instead of using the verbiage in the data file for all the differing letters? I.E. Do not use SECURED WITH DECREASED RATE, etc."

Please follow up with [~billr], while I'm OOO between 7/13 - 7/15.
