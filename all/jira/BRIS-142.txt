comment: [~kent.chan]: Going to change the specs. Can we temporarily create a download-nas02 instance to test? I do understand this box will be replaced physically, but i need to still write files to test out our programs (e.g. /d/iss/, /d/download_tax/ /d/download_root/download_ext, etc etc etc..)
