comment: Hi [~Ethan.Yu],

currently, *the ROOT site* GCBK show (*acctDesc + Masked acctNum*)on enrollment, profile, and account select drop drown.

For *MSM*, there is an *account number drop-down* *box* along with other information such as account status, CIF number, customer name, etc.

Where will this *nickname* be displayed? and which information will be removed to show nickname instead it's not clear as there's no PR document. I need this information before starting to code.



Thanks

Abdullah
