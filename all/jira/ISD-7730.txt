For this update, we are adding a new letter code 167. Can you tell me what would be this notice's description? For now, I've added 'Confirmation Letter Single' as description for 167.

N.B. For letter code '009', the description used is 'Debit Card Privilege Confirmation'.

Let me know if the description needs to be changed.

Thanks
 Azhar
