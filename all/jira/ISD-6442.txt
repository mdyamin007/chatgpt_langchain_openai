title: 26550 - PLBK - Infotrac settings suddenly changed
description: tested behavior on dev and can consistently replicate:

-First open account management properties for client A
-Make an edit and don't save yet
-Open another infotrac dev tab and go to client configs for client B (view only mode)
-Save configs for client A. Once the save goes through, it will show the profile for client B.
-Check client B and it will have client A configs instead. Changes don't apply to client A.
