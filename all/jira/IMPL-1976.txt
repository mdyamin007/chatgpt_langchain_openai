Description/Assessment:

IS Assessment
=============
Hours for development:  5 IS hours



Assessment Details (IS):
=================

- Create post processing script to duplicate 1099INT etax index file and testing for etax posting with ISD

(reference to fnbk_etax_idx_duplicate.pl)

- Add link for etax index duplicate script

/d/tax/prep/mvcu/mvcu_etax_post_handle_1099i.pl -> /home/master/mvcu_etax_idx_duplicate.pl

- 1099INT data file must have only one combine Rec-B for each member.

- Use only SSN# to get all member# and post same tax form to all member#.

Note: Tax form cannot display account# in box. Because the box cannot fit multiple account#.

- client will send two separate xref files - one for FICS data file and the other for Corelation data file.

- xref file will have two fields (SSN#|Member#)

example:

SSN#|Member#

123456779|12345

123456779|123456

123456779|1234567
