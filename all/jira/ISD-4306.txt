title: 19050 - NVCU - Issue printing statements from web browsers
description: Client is experiencing issues printing their statements from the web browser, Chrome in particular. It seems there is no error message, it simple does not print. Notes from the client are as follows:
 * Printing from test account (Bob - user 1476210) - Chrome, IE and Firefox all worked. His eStatement is 3 pages long.
 * My account (user 1426140) - IE and Firefox worked but Chrome does not. My eStatement is 7 pages long.
 * I can use Chrome on my personal laptop to print our test account's eStatement which is 3 pages long but it won't print my personal eStatement which is 7 pages long.
 * User printed a Feb 2021 statement (6 pages long) in early March using Chrome and it worked. They attempted it again on 4/2 and it does not print.



Client can still download the statements, save as PDF, open the PDF in Acrobat Reader and print from Acrobat just fine.

Client also mentioned that there was a new certificate recently installed near end of March. It appears they just started experiencing printing issues coincidentally around the time of this certificate switch. Overall, they suspect it may be due to this new certificate and/or the number of pages. So far they only mention errors with Chrome, so perhaps a recent update may be related to the issue.

*Update*: Client mentioned there was a recent Chrome 89 update on 4/1, which is the same day this issue started occurring.[https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/|https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchromereleases.googleblog.com%2F&data=04%7C01%7Cdhinz%40novation.org%7C6c0f9635b9ed417a2f0508d8f94db29d%7C1aa13eb92bff44eeb4795e03828af0b4%7C0%7C0%7C637533459392023238%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=K47rgUTMEXn2JBOWOUJmONxq5Bths4pmJdif6RzLUz4%3D&reserved=0]

*Update 4/15*: Reproduced the issue on Chrome over a troubleshooting call with the client using a production acct. Only first 3 of 7 pages printed successfully and rest were blank. Additionally, we could not print the same stmt at all when attempting a 2nd time. We think the newest version of Chrome might be blocking the data after the 2-3 page mark.

comment: Tested printing from nvcu pilot, both iFrame and normal sso html page. Was able to successfully print a 7 page stmt from both pages on Chrome 89 and Chrome 90.

comment: Chrome 90 appears to have worked for the client
