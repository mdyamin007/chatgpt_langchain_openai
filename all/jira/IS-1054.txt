UTCU has updated the specs. They want to remove (BUSINESS_ODLC - DL021) and have a minor verbiage change. I am working on updating the ticket. They will also send a new data file. 

Thanks, Barnett 


author: barnetts
comment: Hi [~zhuoxinT] / [~berezinez]

The verbiage looks the same. [^ODLC_eDisclosure_4.25.22.docx]

the data file name will beUTCU_NON_BUSINESS_ODLC_DISCLOSURE_04252022.csv.pgp, right?

And also will send it with all other data files?

 I have to update all the scripts, please confirm ASAP,

I will try to re-process it today, hopefully we can get the sample later today.

Thanks

just want to confirm that we are only generating 1 letter, dl020 for this job right now.

Thanks.




author: barnetts
comment: That is correct [~zhuoxinT]. we are only generating dl 020

comment: [~barnetts]: This is not considered a fasttrack project when the estimate is 8hrs. Anything less than 3.5hrs is considered FastTrack. Please consult with Jessica on this understanding. I've fixed subject line to remove [FastTrack]

Do we need parallel for this new letter?

[~berezinez]- I updated the script, it is generating 1 letter now. Please double check the new DPVS and index file.

comment: [~zhuoxinT]

[~barnetts]- please request a new set of samples for DL020 if needed.

comment: Hi [~zhuoxinT],

It looks like UTCU has an existing DL 020 and 021 
20	Safe deposit Box - Drill
21	Safe deposit Box - Drilled

Is there a way you can change the DL code to 22?
