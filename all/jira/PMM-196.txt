title: Data Encryption at Rest
description: * This vendor states they do not encrypt data at rest but that files sent by SEFCU are encrypted for archive. Can you clarify exactly what is and isnt encrypted at rest that is stored in this vendors environment including backups performed by vendor?
 ** Data that is sent to InfoIMAGE encrypted is re-encrypted after decryption and processing. Files that come in unencrypted are not. If SEFCU sends files encrypted then their files are encrypted at archive. HOW MUCH WORK IS INVOLVED TO HAVE THIS DONE FULLY- Anticipate Q4 2021
