title: EWBB - [33042][pvt][in-house] Mortgage Statement Account Number Update
description: Hot fix for Mortgage Loans (ML1 and Ml2 applications):

Loan number'6810004737' is 10 characters long while our mortgage billing statement formatting program currently expects up to 9 characters. So, the loan number is being truncated to '810004737' in the e-statement index file and individual afp filename.Update EWBBML11.dfa to correctly handle up to the maximum number of characters expected for variable 'ACCT_NUM'. 10 characters should be the maximum expected. If not, other mortgage applications may need to be updated as well.
