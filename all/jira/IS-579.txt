comment: [~jun]: This project does not start until February. Going to assign this project early so that it is in our radar. However, if for any reason Dec/Jan is not a busy tax season, do get a head start so that we can get this project out of the way. Tax is highest priority out of all your projects.

Per BCCU,
All looks good , but we do need the SmartIndexLookup=true deleted from both the statement file and visa file.
Other than that the files all uploaded correctly.
