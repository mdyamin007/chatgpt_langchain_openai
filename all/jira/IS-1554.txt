comment: [~phoebe.george] [~rony] I was able to post the index file successfully and see the dtjobid 133991-C22.01-V22504 on PUI stage, however looks like job status is not showing estatement jobs. I believe PC needs to enable some estatement related flags so that they show on job status.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] Thanks! I've requested PC to enable.

[~gthillaivel] Please confirm once QA is good.
