 [^pfcuml11164.2o1_Part2.pdf]

Note: About the bottom box, I can make it even bigger, but the font size won't match with the rest of the statement. 

Thanks

comment: Thank you Anwar.  I ahve sent the samples to client.

comment: Hi Anwar,

Client requested more changes. See below and the attached pdf.  If any of the requested adjustments push beyond the original scope, please adjust the work order cost accordingly. 

"
Ok, we are done with our review and they all commented that these are looking really great!  We have the following adjustments if possible:

1) Remove the text under the account info box on the top portion of the statement 'AutoPay Enabled - See details below.'  That text is now redundant and removing it will free up a little room to slide the actual AutoPay messages up a half line to give room for accounts with multiple AutoPay messages.

2) Modify the actual AutoPay messages so that they all start with 'AutoPay Enabled - ...' instead of just 'AutoPay - ....'

3) Remove 'Thank You.' from all AutoPay messages.

4) Increase the font size of the member address block on the coupon with little more space between each line to help with readability.

5) The new size of the account table is perfect, please center the box vertically between the return address logo and 'Federally Insured' text to avoid any snooping of the account info through the return address window.

Are the dimensions for the message manager window what we should plan on using going forward?  4x1.1inch and 330x105px

Here is the updated sample.
 [^pfcuml11164.2o1_v2_Part2.pdf] 
 [^pfcuml11164.2o1_v2_Part1.pdf]

No need to change the work order, these are related changes.
 About snooping through the envelope window, I'll check that when it's in QA and will adjust accordingly.

And yes, that's the dimension of message manager right now.

Thanks

comment: Hi Anwar,

Can you confirm that the new message manager image size that we need to provide going forward is 4x1.1inch and 330x105px?

Client approved the update sample.  Please request QA.

Thanks.


author: anwarh
comment: Hi [~dawnl], I already confirmed it in my last comment. But yes, it is "4x1.1inch and 330x105px". 
Currently, it's only changed in the pilot, I'll gradually change it in stage and prod.
