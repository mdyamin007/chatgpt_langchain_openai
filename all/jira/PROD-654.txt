comment: QA need to test posting of index files for TFSL. TFSL e-statement index files are created and uploaded on to ftp servers by customer. This posting is just to trigger emails. This posting will not show or delete pdf files from account management or hypercube site.



Use below index files inside test folder to post and test email jobs. For email to test, change email address of account number after posting from account management tab.
