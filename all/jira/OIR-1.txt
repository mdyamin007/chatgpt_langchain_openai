title: Handling Reprints & Sample Requests in Prisma Production (t18667)
description: The Print Team is having a difficult time of handling reprints and sample requests on the color printers.  In Prisma Production, the backer and blank pages are counted as images which doesn't correlate to the actual image counter on the printed output or DPVS.  The Print Team has to manually search for the actual images in Prisma's viewer which is very inefficient and time consuming.  We need to come of with a better tool for handling these types of print requests (reprints, parallel test print ranges, sample request print ranges).

Project Scope - create an utility to calculate for Prisma print range based on account sequence

comment: On 5/6 enhanced program to handle:

Case 2 - mwcu  - print mode is DD
Case 4 - sncu - print mode is DS (duplex monthly statement, simplex visa statement)

On 5/12 enhanced program to handle:

vwcums1/vwcumv1 - householding
