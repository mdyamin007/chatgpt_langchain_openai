title: UFCU - [28343][pvt][in-house] Manual Approval Process
description: After experiencing several months of no data issues, we would like to remove the manual approval process from monthly statements. Marketing will still approve the statement message or insert as included in those processes, we will just remove the final "approval" allowing InfoImage to go directly to production and expedite the creation of the archival file.

Per client:

Pilot environment looks good. below is a screenshot, so if we are looking at this correctly the approval has been successfully removed.

comment: Hi [~Kbittmann],

According to comment of CU, we can consider this task is approved.

So I am going to request for QA today.

Thanks

comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid],

Please start QA on this.

No need to upload updated project to qa folder. Because the task is to disable online proofing.

The update is done only in control file (ufcums1.control).

You will only need to check in infotrac job status, online proofing related features should NOT display.

I hope DPVS is not needed for testing.

If you need anything, let me know.

Thanks
