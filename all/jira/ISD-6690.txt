description: Paper AOLP only

comment: Hi [~kdishroon], just a reminder per the AC meeting today that this also involves IS updates. As mentioned in Will's comment 37 on TS 26380, we will need to ask PC to create DT_JOB_IDs for Dev/Pilot so that DP can run a current statement cycle for testing. In the meantime I can add the AOLP flag into our PUI configurations so that it's ready by the time DP runs a cycle on pilot, but we won't be able to verify until other departments have done their portion.

comment: Hi [~Shun.Kuwashima],

The client had some questions during our training:
 # They want to know if it is possible to just have to approve the paper; they don;t want to have to approve e; is this possible?
 # Can a link to InfoTRAC be included in the email notification that they receive telling them the statements are ready for approval?
 # If they do not approve have a certain # of days, can it be auto-approved?
 # Is it possible to have double approval? Meaning one CU associate reviews and approves and them an then a 2nd associate reviews and gives final approval. (Currently the AC has to go in an initially approve; is it possible to instead give the CU the ability to give that initial approval?)

1. Yes we can have AOLP only for paper. I've disabled the estatement approval buttons on infotrac, which also means we can revert the aolp configuration changes on ISD end.  In that case, I don't think ISD needs to do anything else besides ensure that the print online proofing configuration exists on infotrac.

I don't think we support the rest of the functionalities they are requesting. Please talk to Sean/David to confirm whether we can/should support these.

comment: [~kdishroon] Since you previously mentioned the client only wants AOLP for paper and not e-statement, there is nothing to release on the ISD side. We can close this story.
