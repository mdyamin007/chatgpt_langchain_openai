"We have one change request to the sample provided earlier today.  Please have the Electronic Consent BOX lowered to be in the center of the line instead of the top of that LINE."

comment: Shun - client approved sample.  Please request QA.

comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid],

Disclosure verbiage and layout updates are deployed onto SSO stage. Please have someone test the following:

* Log into stage SSO using the prefilled info and account number 12345 on the SSO test page. Upon logging in, you should see verbiage matching this screenshot: !mpcu_enrollment_stage.PNG|thumbnail! 
* Please double check that the checkbox is horizontally aligned with the text "I agree...". Beforehand, the checkbox used to be slightly above the text.
* There should be only one hyperlink in the first section that says "ESign Agreement". Please confirm that it is clickable and will direct to this link: https://www.mapscu.com/maps/media/documents/Maps-ESIGN-Consent.pdf
* After logging in, there should be a Disclosure tab at the top. Please confirm that it contains the same verbiage from the first section (In other words, everything from "Electronic Consent" and downward should not show up here on this tab). Screenshot here:  !mpcu_disclosure_tab_stage.PNG|thumbnail! 

Let me know if you have any questions. 

Thanks,
Shun
