TKCUYS001.zip is in qa folder.



Requirements: Previously the below paragraph is programmed to display only if record 714 position 63 is a 1. Now, the customer is requesting to display the paragraph if rec 714 position 63 is a 1 or 0.

The data file inside theTKCUYS001.zip has only 2 customers. One with a record 714 position 63 is a 1 and the other with 0. For both customers[^IS_Checklist.docx], the above paragraph appeared.

The client already approved the sample in the ts [https://app.na3.teamsupport.com/?TicketNumber=29814]comment 41. Sorry I did the sample work before creating jira.



We didn't add any new verbiage here, The coding change is only this:

!image-2022-08-17-04-00-00-704.png!

So that both for 0 or 1 the paragraph will appear now.



So I think no dpvs or index is necessary here. Only papyrus project testing should be sufficient. But if you think you need it let me know.



Hi [~billr]after qa we can release immediately.

Thanks

Rony

Rony, client is asking us to forprovide them with 20 production samples to review. I have asked them if they could provide the data file for the new samples.

Rony, client changed their mind about new samples, the current samples are from the most recent production file. Please release the code when possible and let me and Jessica know so we can update the client.
