Hello, I have attached final artwork "Grayscale_Business and Consumer Fee Schedule Combined.pdf" to Jira for inline insert, thank you!


author: bryanl
comment: [~rumanb]

Hello, client sent an updated final artwork pdf so I have deleted the previous pdf and replaced with "Grayscale_Business and Consumer Fee Schedule Combined UPDATED.pdf", thank you. Please let me know if this will impact sample date of tomorrow and I can let client know.

The sample is at /z/download/ufcu/UFCUMS11.pdf

The sample has 100 customers. Please review the inline inserts that are added at the end of each customer statement.

And you will notice the pagination is considering the insert pages. Escalate this to client if they are ok with this or let me know if they don't want to consider the insert pages as statement pages.

Thanks

[~Bryanl]and Pam are worried about the file archival file size will be so big and cannot upload by client. So can you please work with DP process in parallel environment and send entire archival file to client? So that, client can confirm if it is worked for them.



Thanks

Client has approved sample and are okay with page count, thank you!

comment: Hi [~TunA],

I ran the archival with a data file having only 100 customers. I tried to check how much time it takes and the size of each pdf.

With the inline insert each pdf file size is around 1.8 MB (2 or 3 page statement).

And for 100 customers it took almost half an hour.

!image-2022-03-07-19-13-40-278.png!

And I think it may take more than two days if we run the archival process using the big data.

Please raise these concern to client.

Currently the archival samples with 100 customers is at/z/infoftps4/ufcu/client_pickup/ufcu_stmt_archival_03072022_1.zip.001.pgp

[~Bryanl]please check the archival sample.

Thanks

comment: Hey [~Bryanl],

I copiedthe archival samples with 100 customers in production client pickup folder for UFCU. You can request the client to review.

/d/infoftps4/ufcu/client_pickup/ufcu_stmt_archival_03072022_1.zip.001.pgp

Also, as [~mahbubS]mentioned above, please explained client, it may take more than two days if we run the archival process using the big data, And, confirm Sakib that we still need inserts in archival or not.

Thanks
