Client updated the ticket today asking for the MICR to be removed - let me know if is possible and if more programming is needed. Client response below:

Bill, I connected with Peggy, and she said that since we use a vitual ticket, we can remove the MICR on this LN6281 Statement rather than mask it. Let me know if you have any questions.

It looks like the account number in the Loan Information section also needs masked.

The samples - are ready for the client review

[~billr]
*Please provide print samples - after clients approval*


author: rony
comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid],

This is a change just to mask to account no. So do you still need dpvs for this change? We don't have much time gap between client approval and release date.



Thanks
