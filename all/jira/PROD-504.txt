title: Pop-up Alert:  Display Account Number and Link to Documents
description: Desired Outcome - The client would like the pop-up alert feature that their members view upon logging into their account be changed to allow for more visibility. The pop-up alert would show if there any "new" notices or statements since the last log-in. The alert would then populate with the account number, account nickname, and a link to the notice/statement that the pop-up is referencing.  

Please do analysis and create some markup of new design so that we can review.
