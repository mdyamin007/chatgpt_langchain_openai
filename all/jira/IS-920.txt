comment: [~tohidulI]: Per speaking with [~kericapote], we are targeting 5/19-ish as the release date if approved. I will update due date from 4/1 to 5/19 now.

comment: [~tohidulI] can you confirm the name of this index file? Above you call it ms1 but it should be ms9. This file seems to be month end statements, Can you provide an ms9 index file? [~mac] can find anything that is ms9.

Thanks

currently the estmt index file of slcums9 uses 'ms1' as jid. I asked William if we should change it to ms9, but he suggested we should keep it as it is. I forwarded an email.

comment: [~rony]please provide the new index file like in [IS-921|https://jira.infoimageinc.com/browse/IS-921].

comment: Hi [~avannik]

ms1_20220228_1_20220923_0209_slcu.txt is index file for ms9.

!image-2022-09-23-16-35-05-278.png|width=813,height=300!

As you see in isisdisk_daily.sh for slcums9 it is assigning jid to ms1 . Possibly client wanted the estatement notice in sam tab as ms1 that's why for ms9 index file has ms1 in it's naming.



Thanks

comment: Thanks, Rony, I get it. We do have ms9, but its index file is routed to ms1. A bit confusing, but as they say: as long as it works, don't touch it :)

As I suspected, processing job fails at Staging just like for ms1 index file.


author: rony
comment: Hi [~avannik]

I will ask new dt job id for ms9 and process it and let you know.



Thanks
