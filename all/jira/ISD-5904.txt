I need confirmation about the flags below for setting up PUI and Infotrac:
 # What should be the file name prefix? (i.e: dla, dlb)
 # What should be the global.enotice.desc? "Compromised Card" or "Compromised Card Letter".
 # Will they send automated email notifications after enotice posted?
 # Will new accounts be created from enotice process?
 # What will be the archival period for the Compromised Card Letter?

Please let me know.

Thanks

comment: [~kericapote] [~ratnam] Please see ISD's questions in above comment and address with customer and/or IS accordingly to confirm.

[~Tin.Chak] There are some questions that need to be confirmed internally, can you help address from the PUI side?

comment: [~phoebe.george] [~kericapote] [~ratnam] For item 2, it's more about the letter description on the site. Not sure about item 4, but for some CID, we used to not post the enotice if the account doesn't exist. Do we still post the enotice to an account if it doesn't exist?

[~mamunur.rashid]global.enotice.desc in the PUI should always use a generic E-Notice.

I have set up and processed the file that Tohid provided on PUI pilot. Also, I have set up Compromised Card Letter on Infotrac pilot. I also set up a test email template for compromised card letter.

Will SFCE send automated email notifications for compromised card letter?

Thanks.

comment: Hi [~Tin.Chak]

I ran the process but the e-statement is not appearing on "Job status" tab.

can you check?

comment: [~tohidulI]It's there now. The enotice was not posted due to previous posting is still active. I have to undo the old one.


author: 5b1ee5a72eea651bacdeca2e
comment: [~mamunur.rashid] I have to make a couple of changes on pilot. The enotice tab should always have a generic name like "E-Notice" or similar. It can't have a specific name like "Compromised Card Letter". I also need to add the enotice statement type to the Infoservice and Infoservice JAAS. Please add them next time if you see other apps have statement type defined.

comment: [~mamunur.rashid] [~Tin.Chak] sample on the InfoImage pilot site approved. Please QA. (NOTE: SFCE's OLB won't have the OLB DN Tab ready until June. For now we are just preparing the e site but we will need to test connectivity when they are ready in June.)


author: mamunur.rashid
comment: [~kericapote],

As SFCE's OLB DN tab won't be ready until June should we release it now?


author: kericapote
comment: [~mamunur.rashid] yes, please send it to QA and release when testing is complete . We will need to do connectivity testing in June when they are ready.

comment: Steps for testing:
 # Process files that start with dlb.
 # Check Infotrac stage if there is E-Notice tab there and the processed enotice is shown under the E-Notice tab.
 # Also, test if E-Notice email notification template can be created from Infotrac.

comment: [~mamunur.rashid] thank you.
 hecked InfoTRAC stage (used index-file "dlb_20220203_1_20220325_0632_sfce.txt")
 * Compromised Card Letter when viewed correspond to the client's approved samples.
 * E-Notice email notification template is generated and sent (see Notification Template Management).

comment: [~kericapote],

As QA is completed should we release it to production? Or it will be released in June?

If we release it now SFCE will see E-Notice tab in Infotrac but no enotice data will be there.



Thanks.


author: kericapote
comment: [~mamunur.rashid] why won't it show in e? It won't show tot he CU's members but InfoImage and the CU should be able to see it. I need to parallel first then we can release.

Conf file is committed and deployed to PUI production. I have set up E-Notice to Infotrac prod and Infoservice prod. I also set up e-notification template configuration for E-Notice in Infotrac. I haven't set up Infoservice-jaas yet.

Thanks.

comment: I am going to send this to parallel.

comment: [~mamunur.rashid] I don't see the enotice description showing on InfoTRAC stage. I checked the doc_desc table on all environments and I don't see any enotice codes/descriptions in there. Can you check on this? We need this for parallel testing.


author: mamunur.rashid
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima],

I have added doc_desc on all environments. Please have a look.

Thanks.


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~mamunur.rashid] Thanks, I can see it showing on stage now.
