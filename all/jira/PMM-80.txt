title: Timeline and Setup for Discovery Documents
description: My estimates below:



Analysis of short list products  2 day

Confirming with AM/Rose  1 day (not a must)

Adding products to JIRA for tracking purposes  1 day

Assigning those JIRA tickets  1 day

Creating of Confluence page for (19) products - 1.5  2 months

Training of AM team  week of Aug 17



Our goal is to have this list be done by Aug 17^th^, this of course can change based on what Trisha and her team come up with but this is what I foresee now.
