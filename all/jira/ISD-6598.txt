We are releasing InfoConfig Production this weekend and am currently in the middle of code freeze.

Is it possible to go live on Monday instead of Friday?

comment: Lin,

I don't think that will be an issue, I will follow up with the customer.

It does not look like It will be going live on Monday.

I have not received the approval from client and it will take another 1-2 days to rush through QA.

comment: Hi [~billr],

This will need to go through QA.  I think target live date of 04/06 would give enough time for QA.

Can you please update the live date?

Thanks.
Lin

comment: Lin,

Customer agreed with new live date 4/6/22.

Can you get someone do this testing on Stage.  Can it be completed by tomorrow morning?

Testing on Member SSO site:
http://client-test.infoimageinc.com:8070/sso/
Type in "ewbb" and click on "EWBB".
Click on Stage.
Enter "1011613" in usr_fi_number.  Enter your email address in Email.  click Submit.
Copy the value after "key=" and paste it into ssoKey.  Click Submit.
From dropdown, select Loans - XXXXX02064.  This account has two loan statements dated 06/03/2020 and 01/31/2020.
Under Loan Statements tab, you should see only the loan statement dated 06/03/2020.  The loan statement dated 01/31/2020 is outside archival period.


Testing on MSM Admin site:

Type in "ewbb" and click on "EWBB".
Click on Stage.
Type in username and password and click Submit.  If you do not know this credential, please reach out to me.
Search for account number 301002064.  This is the same account we tested in Member SSO site test.
Click on any one of the customer name.
You should see only the loan statement dated 06/03/2020.
