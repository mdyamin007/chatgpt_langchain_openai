comment: Hi [~jun]: Jira story is assigned to you per your assessment.

Hi [~kericapote]: Next time, please assign JIRA to engineer according to assessment "Engineering resource: JunM". DO NOT leave it as unassigned. IS will not know who will work if you leave Jira as unassigned.



thanks,

Tun

Sorry, the parallel id should only have SACUMV21.dfa. I've created new parallel id. Please use this one instead.
