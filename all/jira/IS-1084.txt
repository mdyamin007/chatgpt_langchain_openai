comment: Hi [~SamV2021], please see attached feedback and updated test file.

Per GCBK:

"I've attached the feedback received from the first round of testing; only a few things were noted.

Also, there is a change needed on our end for #3, so I've attached a new test file for this."

Attached updated samples.[^gcbk_collection_notices_051722_sample.pdf]

Regarding #4 in client feedback: There doesn't seen to be any extra space after the dollar amount on any of the letters.


author: dyuen
comment: Thanks [~SamV2021], updated samples have been provided to GCBK.


author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~SamV2021],

I spoke with GCBK and [~Peter.Dang], they need to add one more change to the letter. Right now, the letter has the date and masked account number on the right of the notice. Can you have it moved to the left as shown below?

Note: GCBK does not want anything in the yellow highlight to show in the window.

Please see updated samples:[^gcbk_collection_notices_051722_sample_new.pdf]

Also, I am not sure if we can meet the due date of 05/31 (next Tuesday) since we need to receive final client approval, have print samples provided to QA, and do parallel testing.

Thanks!


author: dyuen
comment: [~SamV2021], per our zoom, I notified GCBK to provide approval of the samples by tomorrow, EOD so that I can get print samples and parallel initiated on 5/31.

[~berezinez] [~Igor.Khosid], FYI.


Thanks!


author: dyuen
comment: [~SamV2021], GCBK thought that the date was a little too crowded, so they requested that the date be moved to above the account number, as shown in below screenshot. Can this be done?

Also they aware this additional change will push out the live date again.

Per GCBK:

Now that marketing is seeing this change, they pointed out that it's a bit too crowded at the top.
They have requested that the date go right above the Re: Account line instead.

Below is where she has requested it be moved

With this change, I'm guessing we won't meet the EOD sign off, which we understand."



Thanks,
Daphne

 # Please update the status for waiting for QA
 # No endorsement on the print samples - please request a new set of samples.
 # please provide an index file with the latest updates.




author: dyuen
comment: [~berezinez], the print samples do not have an endorsement because per SOW it is on the outer envelope.

[~SamV2021], please provide update ASAP so that we can turn over for parallel.

Thanks!

 * Re-exportedproject files to shared drive: /d/iss/qa/GCBK/GCBKDL023.zip
 * Like Daphne mentioned, it looks like the endorsement line is not expected, according to what I see in the afps of the gcbk daily notices in production. The samples provided to client thus far contained an endorsement line as they were generated from locally, and there was a local variable setting that had the endorsement turned on. So, endorsement is not expected on the print samples.
 * Provided ISD index file to post:dla_20220517_1_20220527_1340_gcbk.txt
 * Since the archival file is too large to post here, I have copiedGCBK_DLA_archival_20220517_1_1.zip over to /d/iss/alis (i.e. \\download-nas02\alis)

Thanks!

comment: [~SamV2021], I know this is in parallel right now, but did an archival file get generated? If so, can you place a copy in their client pickup test folder? GCBK wants to test import into their system to ensure there aren't any issues.

Thanks!


author: JIRAUSER10906
comment: [~dyuen]

Yes, I have copied overGCBK_DLA_archival_20220517_1_1.zip to their client pickup test folder.
