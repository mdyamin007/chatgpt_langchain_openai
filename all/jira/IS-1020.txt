author: phoebe.george
comment: [~thomasY] [~TunA] [~Peter.Dang] [~William.Kong] IS - please provide a sample date for this. It was turned over 5/9 and need to provide SUCU with a sample date. Thank you!


author: thomasy
comment: [~phoebe.george]Please set a sample date of Fri. 6/3 for now, but it will likely be done earlier.


author: thomasy
comment: [~phoebe.george]I placed a sample in their client pickup:

sucu_ms2_archival_20220531_1_1.zip.pgp


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~thomasY] Thanks, I have informed SUCU to pull down from the FTP for testing.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~thomasY] Also updating live date for a tentative date of 6/17 for now.


author: william.kong
comment: [~phoebe.george]: Please advise status on Approvals. Live date is Friday, June 17 and we need to have time for QA and Parallel run. I really don't believe we can make 6/17 live date. If this is going to be a concern, please let us know ASAP. We do not want to miss another launch date for this client and get escalated by the CEO again.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~thomasY] We received approval of the test files. Please confirm if we can update the live date to 6/28/22.

Thank you!


author: thomasy
comment: [~phoebe.george]Yes, 6/28 will be ok.


author: william.kong
comment: [~thomasY]: Per our conversation, please submit this to QA.



[~phoebe.george]: This project will require parallel.
