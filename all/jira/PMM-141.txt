title: TeamSupport Ticket #13250 - DACB
description: DACB - Update to Email Notifications



he following is from Bob Christensen:

We opened this ticket after finding out that email notifications are being sent to all associated customers on an account, after it is enrolled in electronic statements. This is a huge issue for us. We have customers who open accounts with someone as a POD (Payee on Death). These customers do this and do not want the POD to know. So, you can see the issue.



We also have businesses where people who are Authorized Signors on the account, should only have access to do certain things on the account, like perform the functions to do Payroll, or ACH Collections. They are not to have access to the statements, yet they are notified when the statement is ready. Granted, they should not be able to access the statements via online banking due to the access granted them, but that does not stop them from gaining access via the DSO. The notification needs to be limited to the person that enrolls and enters their email. There should be a way to limit this without requiring us to remove emails from our Core System.



Thank you for your time.
