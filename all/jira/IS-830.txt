I know you have several things on your plate. Please don't forget about this ticket.

Thanks, Barnett


author: thomasy
comment: [~barnetts]Looks like there is some issues with the data file format. The comma inside the fields with the city state zip is causing parsing issues.

Can they surround each field in quotation marks or change the field delimiter to use something other than a comma?

[~barnetts]I will still need to know if they will be able to change the data format from the comment above or if we need another solution.

Please see SANA feedback below. 
They want it possible to code the Applicant Name, Address (Street, City & Stat)  and Salutation in proper case however we would like this in all CAPS to be consistent with our statements and notices format. 

Thanks, Barnett 



author: thomasy
comment: [~barnetts] Are they saying they want the name, address etc. in all caps? The feedback you wrote above is conflicting and confusing.


author: barnetts
comment: Hi [~thomasY],

Sorry for the confusion. Yes, they want all CAPS.

comment: [~barnetts]: This project has exceeded it original time several times and changed specs during the middle of the project. This needs to be the last round of samples. Any additional changes may incur additional programming hours. Again this project is past due (5/5/2022). Can you advise when client confidently can provide us realistic live date. Please advise.


author: barnetts
comment: Hi [~thomasY] / [~William.Kong],

Please see the requested format update for their 2nd page.
1) Please remove the decimal. The Credit Score is 3 digits. It should be "652" not "652.0"
2) Please only map the date not the time. The format should be MM-DD-CCYY 
Mock up of changes is attached.

Please see SANA response [^SANA_Correction_Mock_up_5.20.22.pdf]  below.

comment: FYI, per 6/15 meeting with SANA, they found an issue with the data on their end. They will be sending a new test file and request a logic change.

Note, when they provide the new test file, they would like to have samples from the full file for review. The full PDF file can be dropped in their client pickup TEST folder.

[~barnetts]


author: william.kong
comment: [~dyuen]: Just a FYI. Several month's ago, I had advised [~barnetts]that we had exhaused all the estimated hours for this long running project and client keeps going back and forth with changes. If this change is out of scope, we will need to bill accordingly for the additional changes.


author: dyuen
comment: [~William.Kong], I've notified SANA and asked Pam to create another PR for IS to assess. If I remember correctly, depending on the hours quoted, SANA may not be billed since they have a special clause or agreement in their contract. I will let [~barnetts]confirm that though.

Thanks


author: tuna
comment: HI [~dyuen] ,

I believe Your previous comment is for TS# 30115. I assigned the ticket to [~thomasY]to review the following additional changes request. We can adjust new timeline after that ticket is assessed.

Thanks,

Tun





Additional Update requests on IS-830:

- If Vendor_ScoreID is blank, DO NOT print or display below verbiage and
use the "We thank you for this opportunity to consider your request. Sincerely, Credit Human Auto Lending Department."
(aka "closing verbiage" as referred to in TS #30115, comment 136).
- In addition, when the Applicant_TotalScore field in the data file is blank,
then Your credit score: on the adverse action notice should be blank not 0.
(See attachment in TS #30115, comment 143)
- Test data:SANA_IAAdverseAction_061522_1.csv.pgp
- Format program: sanadl014.dfa is under IS-830 (Thomas's parallel id 20220321180556)

The data format was incorrect as well. Please have them make sure the quotes in each field are removed, they were not there in the previous test file. I manually removed them this time.

Can you please advise where the date field (top right of the notice) comes from? 
Do we generate them or does it come from the data?

comment: [~barnetts]That is from system date.


author: barnetts
comment: Thank you [~thomasY],

SANA is stating that the Date located in the section with the credit score and score range be MM-DD-CCYY however it is still reflecting CCYY-MM-DD. They are referring to the date in the credit score section (located in the second page/image of the notice) which comes from the <Score_RequestDate> field within the data file.  Can this be corrected ? 

Thanks, Barnett 


author: thomasy
comment: [~barnetts]The format of the date in the test data has changed. Please have them confirm that the date will be arriving as YYYY-MM-DD from now on.

author: barnetts
comment: Hi [~thomasY],

Per SANA,
The date of the notice (located at the top right of the notice) is not included in one of the fields in the data file; I believe it is the date the file is processed. On the field mapping document, it indicates it is <Todays Date (Calculated).
As for the <Score_RequestDate>, I will confirm that it will be formatted at YYYY-MM-DD.

Thanks, Barnett 


author: barnetts
comment: Hi [~thomasY],

SANA confirms that the <Score_RequestDate> will be in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD) going forward.
