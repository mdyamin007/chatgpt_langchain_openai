title: 19468 - SEFC - AOLP divert feature
description: Enable Estatement Divert on client configurations for SEFC at 12pm on 7/26. 

Did testing on pilot with some existing pilot jobs posted on job status:
* Clicked on job details
* A divert check box shows up on the right most side, tested clickin on 10 of them and hitting submit
* A divert job gets triggered on the pui (no log file, not sure if expected)
* There is a divert report on infotrac, which should show all the accounts that were diverted.
* The statement status is updated to 8 in the database, which should make the statement not viewable (tested infotrac, tried testing sso but there were some hypercube sso issues)

comment: Tested divert feature on pilot, divert process automatically triggers and statements are not viewable as expected.
