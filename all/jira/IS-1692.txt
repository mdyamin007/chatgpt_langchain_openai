This project is assigned to Chad as per the IM Report, and he is not on Jira. [~enricob] is going to turn this over shortly, so I have assigned this Story to you.

Thank you!

Possible missing tiff?

Is that graphic?

Hey Guys, just following up on the missing tiff.  !WHY_Statement.png|thumbnail! 
For reference, on the IDCU app the tiff name is IDCUEY. 
It's the text that reads: "Why are you receiving this statement?"

Thank you!
Chad

comment: [~Juliana Vannik], Please ask Wilson to create the same TIFF as IDCU"Why are you receiving this statement?" but in COMM color.
