title: SNFB - [26683][pvt] In-Line Inserts Update
description: 

Assessments

1. create resources for each insert - can probably use S1SNFIN[1-6].300 for the 9 inserts

-Excessive NSF insert is in production - S1SNFNSF.300, can reuse this for 9th insert

2. read in each file list into array in SNFBMS11.dfa

3. For Excessive NSF, check all accounts (. For all other inserts, check only Savings accounts

-if account exists in array list, assign insert flag=1

4. after the PRINT_CHK... format, check to see which insert flag is on then display that insert

-there should be a max of 3 inserts

-order of inserts should be as :

 a. For Savings statements: Savings Change in Terms, Sign&Save Match and then if the savings has an Excessive OD notice add it last.

  b. For savings accounts that are combined with a checking, and the checking is on the Excessive OD list: Excessive OD list, Savings Change in Terms and then Sign&Save Match



Timeline:

Turn over to IS 3/9/22

Samples to QA 3/18/22 - also provide resources to ISD

Samples to client 3/23/22

They will be providing a new list for the Excessive OD insert. The insert will remain the same each quarter, but the account list will be new each time.



What is the latest date the client can provide the finalized account lists prior to releasing this update?


author: yameelee
comment: [~Kbittmann] I can use the ones we have (old one for Excessive OD) for samples unless they want to send new lists for samples then I would need it by tomorrow. As for production, I am not sure on how many days you guys need to prep the dockets etc, so should be on your side.

Please see the below feedback from SNFB:

We are working on getting the finalized lists for all inserts, but I dont know if we will have them all available tomorrow. For samples, we are fine with you using the lists you have, including the old one for Excessive OD.

Estmt index:ms1_12312021_1_03242022_1717_snfb.txt (requested ISD Jira from Joye, will add to it and have ISD upload resources on it).

Attached DPVS for test print - includes all scenarios I can find on qa list. Please have laser print all accounts (14) from qa file.




author: yameelee
comment: Here are the samples ([^snfbms1_selective_inserts.pdf]converted from .qa print file). I only include one account per scenario that I can find in the snfbms1_selective_inserts.pdf sample file - using the lists from ticket comment #40 and 1/1/2022 data file per client (all accounts are in the test data file - snfb_insert_test.dat - exported to qa folder).

*accounts with 1 insert*

1101000171 - ExtendedSavingsPT806.txt

1102207790 - SuperbSavingsPT825.txt
1900540021 - InvestmentSavingsPT820.txt
1900573353 - Sign&SaveSavingsPT815.txt
2100637858 - StatementSavingsPT801.txt
4301063910 - FirstKidsSavingsPT803.txt
8300047530 - EssentialSavings-PT802.txt
9300017740 - Excessive_NSF_OD.txt

*accounts with 2 inserts*

8101010910 - Sign&SaveSavingsPT815.txt & Sign_and_Sign_Match.txt

1100952344 - StatementSavingsPT801.txt & Sign_and_Sign_Match.txt
9300014363 - EssentialSavings-PT802.txt & Excessive_NSF_OD.txt

*accounts with 3 inserts*
1101003151 - Sign&SaveSavingsPT815.txt, Sign_and_Sign_Match.txt & Excessive_NSF_OD.txt
150125818 - StatementSavingsPT801.txt, Sign&SaveSavingsPT815.txt & Sign_and_Sign_Match.txt
150134701 - StatementSavingsPT801.txt, Sign&SaveSavingsPT815.txt & Sign_and_Sign_Match.txt



*FYI:*for [^snfbms1_combined_with_checking_inserts.pdf], I couldn't find a scenario with checking and savings combined that has all 3 flags so I include this account on the 3 inserts to show that if there is a combined account with checking, the Excessive NSF insert will go first, then the Change in Terms, and the Sign and Save ([^000162649098.txt]).

1, please request print samples.

2. is this update has pdf archival? or print side and eside only?

[~yameelee]

please let me know once eside posting is ready for verification with all new resources.




author: yameelee
comment: This is for archival as well. I got the pdfs of the same accounts and zipped them up( [^12312021_1101003151_34416.pdf] &[^12312021_150125818_22856.pdf]). You can get the rest in/z/pdf_afp/snfb/snfbms1/pdf_ftp/ folder. I did copy them all to my folder and review them just did not want to post too many PDFs on here.

NOTE: I did not finish the archival process because after more than 5hrs it still did not finish creating the PDFs so I killed the process to start something else. But all of the accounts in the sample list above are created so you can get them to show the inserts.(production takes over 1hr to create 10k PDFs).
