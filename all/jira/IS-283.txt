comment: Hi [~dyuen],

In the test file "sefc_dn_pdf_071621.zip.pgp" from comment 18 ticket 21121, the sefcudpdf*INDTD.pdf data file for this letter has the address and content in different positions for some of the PDFs. The data for the address and an anchor needs to stay in the same position for all the PDFs for Redtitan to correctly parse the files.I am thinking of using the salutation "Dear ..." verbiage as the anchor. Please check with client if they can make the address and salutation "Dear ..." stay in the position for all the PDF.

comment: Hi [~dyuen], next available would be notice code 414.

comment: Hi [~jun], here is SEFC's feedback:

"I don't think that will be a problem. We've run into some field mapping issues back on the MeridianLink side, so I don't think our initial target of 8/27 will work on our end as we're waiting on their support team for an enhancement. "

Let's work on getting samples to them and I'll keep you posted on when they can go live.

Thanks!

comment: Hi [~dyuen],

Sounds like they're going to make update to the format of the PDF files. I wouldn't be able to provide samples until they send the new data files, unless they plan to use the same format as one of the existing test files from "sefc_dn_pdf_071621.zip.pgp. But I would need to know which test files to use for development so I can map it correctly.


author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~jun], good point. I updated the ticket for the client to confirm if we will be getting new test files or not. Thanks!


author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~jun], client confirmed that we will be getting a new test file. I'll push out the due date and update the ticket once I have a new test file.

Thanks!

comment: [~dyuen]: Any updates on this? We may need to push this project even more further our to the following month. Please advise.


author: dyuen
comment: [~William.Kong] [~jun], no, I don't have any updates. I already followed up with SEFC on my call yesterday. The new test file delays is largely due to their vendor. I will provide an update as soon as I have one.

Thanks


author: jun
comment: [~dyuen], Is it okay to push this live date further out for end of month September?


author: dyuen
comment: [~jun], sure. I updated the due date to Sep 30th. Thanks!


author: william.kong
comment: [~dyuen]: Any updates or ETA for [~jun]to get the test files? Live date is in 3 days and we may need to delay again in light if this pending deliverable.


author: william.kong
comment: [~jun]: Per your observiation on the EPIC ticket, this job is on hold.

[~dyuen]: I've marked this project on-hold per your epic comments


author: william.kong
comment: [~dyuen]: Do you have any updates from this project? have SEFC's vendor responded? Please advise.


author: dyuen
comment: [~William.Kong], nothing yet. Thanks


author: william.kong
comment: [~dyuen]: Any new updates or can we cancel this project since their vendor is non-responsive?


author: dyuen
comment: [~William.Kong], no response. Let me keep this open until next Thursday since I have a regular call with them. I can then confirm if we should cancel or not. Thanks


author: dyuen
comment: [~William.Kong], this ended up being re-opened as a new ticket, see ticket #26299. With that being said, I can update the description and ticket number above. Do you think the timeline can be adjusted?


author: william.kong
comment: [~dyuen]: I had asked [~jun]to review the new PDF data files to see if there are major difference where we need to quote additional hours. Based on his quick assessment, he observed the Saluation needs to move from 3inch from the top to 3.6 inches or it will show through the window. This was how it was in the old test files.



Can SEFC send is updated data file and then we can revisit how we can fit this project back into the timeline.


author: dyuen
comment: Requested for an updated data file. Thanks


author: william.kong
comment: [~dyuen]: Any updates on getting the replacement data file with the salutation position adjustment? I will still place this project on hold for now.


author: dyuen
comment: [~William.Kong], per my updates on ticket #26299, SEFC is working on getting new samples. I told them that if I get new samples by April 4th, we could still meet the timeline that Tun quoted.

comment: [~William.Kong] [~jun], we're going to have to keep this project on hold. I spoke with SEFC today and they still don't have the updated samples. Let me know how you want to handle the JIRA.

Thanks

This project is holding for a while.

I will remove from developer resource list, if we don't have any action within one week from now.

Developer will not reinitiate project until we setup new timeline.

Please let me or Peter know if we need to restart the project.

Thanks,

Tun

comment: Hi [~TunA],

At this time, SEFC has not re-opened the ticket. I'm not sure when they have new samples/files ready either. For now, should leave the Jira in "Hold'. Will this interfere with anything? [~Jessica]should the Jira be marked "Canceled" then have InfoCARE open a new epic once everything is ready to start?

[~jun] [~Peter.Dang][~William.Kong]

Thanks

comment: Hi [~dyuen],

We can just leave as "hold" for this Story.

But we will need new timeline when client wants to resume this project. Because the developer may busy with other projects.

Please let me know when client wants to resume project.

Thanks

Tun

comment: Hi [~dyuen],

Just FYI. I removed from resource schedule. We can just leave as "hold" for this Story.

But we will need new timeline when client wants to resume this project.
Because the developer may busy with other projects.

Please let [~Peter.Dang] or me know when client wants to resume project.
Thanks

comment: [~dyuen]:What is the status on this project. We've had this project on-hold for over a month now. If client is not interested to resume, can we bill can close out this project? Please advise.


author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~William.Kong], I think we will have to close out this project. There has been no movement from the client on this as they're pretty busy with the Black Knight conversion. I don't think there was any work done therefore I don't think it would be billable at this point. Agreed?

[~Jessica], FYI.




author: william.kong
comment: Agreed. I will close this out now.

[~jun]: Per [~dyuen], since there is no movement and you did not do actual coding, we will cancel this project.
