OPS responded to the sample print request:

The print range you requested (161-168) is out of the print range for the sheldla 121.sam.afp file.

The only file that has that range is the 4.2o1.


author: JIRAUSER11101
comment: [~billr]

Can we do sheldla1214.2o1.afp (445-459)?


author: billr
comment: [~zhuoxinT]

Thanks, just sent a revised request.
