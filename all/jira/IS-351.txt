title: SPCU  Bad Email Daily Notices
description: Setup Bad Undeliverable Processing Script for Daily Notices (dna & dnb) as part of the Corelation conversion project.

Please use JID: jba and jbb

Please refer to the old/home/master/spcudcb_process.sh when working on the jba and jbb script. We need to setup the process for the two new daily notice scripts (dna & dnb) to process. 

[~Shun.Kuwashima] from ISD will update their script to create the undeliverable index files:

from /d/ftpbu/spcubu/bad_email/spcu_dlb_undeliverable_1_MMDDYYYY_HHMMSS.txt.pgp to /d/ftpbu/spcubu/bad_email/spcu_*{color:#ff0000}dna{color}*_undeliverable_1_MMDDYYYY_HHMMSS.txt.pgp

He will also create another one called/d/ftpbu/spcubu/bad_email/spcu_{color:#ff0000}*dnb*{color}_undeliverable_1_MMDDYYYY.txt.pgp



Please don't forget to create the procedure file for spcudba.procs and spcudbc.procs for this project as well.



Parallel is required

No samples needed

No client approval needed.
