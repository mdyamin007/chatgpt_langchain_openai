Naim said he can't connect to the following. I believe MSBK has not been created but 17/18 should have.

ca-proxy-pr-17
 ca-proxy-pr-18
 ca-proxy-pr-17/18 VIP 10.4.8.217
 ca-proxy-prod-msbk-01
 ca-proxy-msbk-pr-02

Thanks

David

comment: Kent,
Please look at Golam's last comment.  Look like one VM still need access to Proxy.
Thanks
