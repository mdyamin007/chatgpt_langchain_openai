comment: Dave, this is done. I highlighted parts not done in yellow because they are not yet available. There are also a few questionable items:

ca-elk-st-01 10.5.16.156 to ca-rhstore-pr nfs - _why not to rhstore-dv_

ca-inforeach-st-01/02 10.5.16.197,10.5.16.198 to ca-mongoreg 27017 - _why not mongoir?_

ca-pui-pi-01 10.5.16.188 tomailer-pui-dev - _struck out in the brisbane server list, not needed?_

ca-prism-pi 10.5.16.183/10.5.16.184 totx-dds-pr 1433- _Why no ca-dds-pr?_

ca-prism-pi 10.5.16.183/10.5.16.184 topvnas-pr nfs - _why writing to prod not dev?_

I checked both destination servers you are reporting the ACL is not working for:

ca-mysql-dv0-01 is NOT listening on 27017

!image-2020-10-23-16-50-34-586.png!

ca-mongoreg-dv-02 is NOT listening on 27017

!image-2020-10-23-16-49-50-597.png!



The issues are at the app level, not network level. Check these before reporting that the network access is incorrect.

also, please note that a "connection refused" means the destination server is not listening, but the network access is good. Connection Timeout means the network access is not open.
