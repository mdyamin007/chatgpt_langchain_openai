comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] Can you confirm if you previously setup this application (prefix ls1) for FCBT applications? It was tied to original setup JEF #47979. 

IS is working to rush this setup and possibly providing an index file. I believe you had set this up on the ISD side for pilot, but IS had not provided an index file at that time. Can you confirm?

Thank you!

comment: [~phoebe.george] Yeah, looks like prefix ls1 is already setup on all environments, including production. Assuming there's no issue with the index file itself, then they should post successfully.

comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] Can you assist to post this index file:

comment: [~phoebe.george] [~jasonV] I tried posting that file onto pilot, but the account type is longer than expected so it threw an error. We should be seeing a 2 letter type such as LN, DD, etc but instead it is showing as 'Statement'. Can you look into this?

comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] thanks!

[~jasonV] Account Type should be 'LN' for all. Thanks!

comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima]I will try to see why Account type is'Statement' and not LN

comment: Thanks [~jasonV], this one posted successfully on pilot.

[~phoebe.george] It should be viewable on infotrac pilot under the Statements tab, please check this acct 595436001.
