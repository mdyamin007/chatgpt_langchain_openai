this is to deactivate letter 012. I updated the procs file accordingly.

And inrwcudlc_process.sh script:

!image-2022-04-20-12-52-08-570.png!



so from now on letter 012 will not be processed.

Today I ran with
rwcucdgen0325_TEST.txt.asc which is for letter 013
and
rwcurespadult0321.txt.asc which is for letter 012.


You can check the dpvs /z/daily/rwcudlc/rwcudlc119.print only letter 013 entry is there. Also can check:

ls -ltr /z/daily/rwcudlc/*afp

you will find only afp for letter 013.

comment: Letter was not included in the SOW originally, but I added it but struck through it to indicate that it is de-activated.
