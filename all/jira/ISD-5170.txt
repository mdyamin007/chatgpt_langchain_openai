comment: [~MattL], this will require a PUI restart, therefore I probably will have to release this EOD after most jobs are finished posting. I'll update you once it's complete.

comment: [~MattL], I released the necessary code updates on production and currently running a purge of all DD accounts. It's taking a bit longer than I anticipated, but it should be done in a few hours. I'll check on this first thing tomorrow morning when I log on.
