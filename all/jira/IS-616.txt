According to Thomas, comment #32, he +thinks+ we just need to add a condition to check var[7] to the total logic to take account for Everyday Money shares. An example of the 09  EVERYDAY MONEY ACCOUNT product share is in comment #26.

Please see below client feedback and advise:

Would it be possible for you to send us samples with transactions on them? In the first samples we received there were samples that had transactions on them, the group of accounts chosen for this sample set did not have any transactions so it is hard to know for sure if the samples are correct.{color:#1f497d}I also noticed that there were some accounts that had two Everyday Money shares in our system but only one share would appear on the statement sample. An example would be the statement for Earl Andrews, account ending in 1920. Our system shows that he has two Everyday money shares with account suffix 08 and 09 that were opened on the same day. They should both be showing on the sample but only share 08 is populating.{color}

There is two statement having named Earl Andrews. But none of them have multiple Everyday Money Share account in the data file I have.
Thanks.
