comment: Hi [~andreav]



There is some issue going on on the Infotrac site. We are communicating with the ISD team to resolve the issue. So at this point, I can't commit to providing a sample tomorrow. But coding is done on our part. As soon as the InfoTrac issue gets resolved the pilot will be available. We will let you know asap.



Thanks

We ran for a pilot today. Check for dt job id139221-C01.01-V22736. But only one account is there.
