title: Tool tip hidden issue in profile page
description: The toolbar icon is being covered. I found out the issue, is that if there is more than one account, the accounts can collapse and expand. Because of this, the *panel-body* and the *collapsed-details* classes get the style of *overflow: hidden* if you remove the *overflow:hidden*, then it will pop up in image number 2
