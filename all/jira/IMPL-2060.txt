title: MFCU - [28957][pvt] Additional Signers _ Duplicate
description: During out review of the member monthly statements, we found that the "Additional Signers" line will show the same name repeated 2 or 3 times.

We believe this is happening because the statement process must be looking for Joint members at both the+account+and+loan+levels.

While it is correct for the logic to show the member's name each time the account is flagged as a joint, we would prefer for each unique additional signer's name be printed only once.

Please see the attached document for 2 examples.
