10.8.14.55:27017 -> ( ca-mongojob-pi-02.infoimageinc.com:27017, ca-mongojob-st-02.infoimageinc.com:27017)
10.8.9.187:27017 -> (ca-mongojob-pi-01.infoimageinc.com:27017, ca-mongojob-st-01.infoimageinc.com:27017)

Based on your matrix, same IP points to different url?

comment: [~anil.dasa]: Can you confirm if the comments Terrence has above is correct. We want to be 100% sure these two IP address point to the correct server name.

We have same mongo instances for pilot and stage. But collection name will vary for pilot and stage. We are consolidating all mongo collections in ca-mongoreg-dv-01 and 02 on lower environments. So we don't have separate instance named as ca-mongojob-dv-01 and 02. This is same as menlo replica in lower environments.
