comment: Dave a lot of the items were open with the pilot/stage/dev request



Can you confirm if there's anything different needed

comment: Kent,

I updated a shorter list from the original one that I uploaded.

Please check if these are open. Naim said they tried to mount to some of the isilon but port was not open.

Thanks
David

comment: [~davidt]- this is mostly done....there is some outstanding items such as:

There is no mailpost pilot

swift dev is connection refused, issue is at server level



MOST of what is on the list already existed. Blue is added, green was already existing and red is issue with the destination server service.



Ive attached the updated list

I have just tried -

ca-apipui-st-01 to ca-isilon01-nfs Port: NFS
ca-apipui-st-02 to ca-isilon01-nfs Port : NFS

I have not tried the others, can you double check.
