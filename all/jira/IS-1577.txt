comment: Hi Nischala, can you please reprocess with the Pilot DT JOB ID so I can see the job on Pilot InfoTRAC Job Status?


author: nischala.manjunath
comment: [~eric.yan] - The new eStatement index file is ml1_20220906_1_20220930_1236_gmbk.txt, can you please post it to pilot and upload the attached resources?  [^S1SNFBMO.300]  [^S1SNFB12.300]  [^S1SNFBNB.300]  [^S1SNFBM3.300]. 
[~andreav] - I processed on pilot with the DT JOB ID and paper shows up under Job Status but eStmt says currently running. [~eric.yan] - can you please advise?
Thanks!

comment: [~nischala.manjunath],

Just wanna confirm, S1SNFBNB.300 is an old resource right?


author: nischala.manjunath
comment: [~eric.yan] - If it already exists, you don't have to replace it. Wasn't sure if these resources were provided to ISD before. Thanks!


author: andreav
comment: [~nischala.manjunath] - Please move this to QA once posted. QA needs to review before releasing to client for review.

Ready for the client review


author: andreav
comment: [~nischala.manjunath] - - Client has approved InfoTRAC and the API set up. Please provide QA what they need to start reviewing.
They have decided to only pre-ingest back to core conversion live date as per original scope.
