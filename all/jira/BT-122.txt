comment: [~gthillaivel] All the letters in index file dlc_20220606_1_20220729_1226_sefc.txt are letter code 027, not 049. So from ISD's perspective, this looks fine since we have letter 027 mapped to 'HELOC Draw Reminder Letter (6 Months Out)'.

[~thomasY] Can you confirm if the index file is supposed to contain all letter code 027? Gnana seem to be expecting letter 049 based on her screenshot in the previous comment. If the index file is fine, then I don't think this is a bug.
