This is an update in script only.
If a the data file contains the line
*"No data exists for LN6660P today"*
then the script will send an email to internal. I've already forwarded you the mail which looks like this

My test data is /z/download/star/loan/ln6660P_10192021_01.txt.PGP

Thanks,
Fahad.

comment: [~fahad]: I don't see the program transfer form again! This was the same issue last time. Please make program transfer form is attached so that[~TunA]can help release the code.



[~phoebe.george]: The original live date was 11/19. Since it just got passed, i've updatd live date to be 11/23 to give enough time for us to release code.

comment: Hi[~William.Kong],
 My apology for that. I thought transfer form is supposed to get provided for new application setup. So should we provide transfer form for all the update release even if it's a single existing resource?

Hi[~phoebe.george],

I've attached the transfer form.
 Thanks
