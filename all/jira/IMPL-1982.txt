title: SUCU - eCredit Card Processing Script Update for Un-zipping files
description: Permanent update to the processing script to unzip an inside file as well for processing. Here is how the files will be arriving moving forward - please confirm hours and timing needed to update the processing script to eliminate any further manual packaging of files:

Outer zipped file: sucu_cc_mmddyy_1.zip

The outer zipped file will then be encrypted with PGP and will look like this:
 * Outer zipped PGP file: sucu_cc_mmddyy_1.zip.pgp 

Inside the zipped and encrypted file will be:
 * CardStatements_mmddyy.zip
 * CardStatemenIndexmmddyy.txt

From SUCU: _When I download the files from Coop I get the .txt file and all the PDFs are in a zipped file. I dont plan on unzipping that zip file._
