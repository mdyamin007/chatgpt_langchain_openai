per the client:

Can we add some additional spacing at the end of the letter?
 * Add more space after the bullet points.... and
 * space between the last two paragraphs, especially for the one that starts "Thank you for your business....".


author: JIRAUSER11800
comment: Hi [~MattL],

1) More space after the bullet points added.

2) Space between the last two paragraphs, especially for the one that starts "Thank you for your business...." added.

Qa checklist is already attached.

Yes, ffin0001.source is the correct one.



Hi [~MattL]

Just FYI, may be dp already trained about this, but dp needs to create ffin0001.ins in /home/insert/ folder.



Thanks
