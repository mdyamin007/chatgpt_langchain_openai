Per client:

I reviewed the sample statement and what I saw looks good. BUT I did not see any transactions showing the corrections we requested. The Check #s is not in this sample statement. Can you have the programmer provide a sample with Check Cleared Examples?



Thank you!

can you check the page 10 of the sample pdf? There is an account with "Checks Cleared" section.
