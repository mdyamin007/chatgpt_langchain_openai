title: Hypercube - Support unenrollOnDeliveryPreferenceChange feature for one to many
description: Currently, ifunenrollOnDeliveryPreferenceChange feature is enabled for any client then if the user changes any one of their accounts DP to paper, hypercube will unenroll the user and log out. But now it will check for all of the accounts dp. If all the accounts are not changed to paper then it will not unenroll the user.


 * *For non-selective:*

Hypercube will check for all of the accounts DP. We will not unroll the user until all the accounts DP are changed from paperless to paper..
 * *For selective:*

Hypercube will check if all the accounts selectivePaperless status. If all the accounts selectivePaperless status is Paper then hypercube will unenroll the user, otherwise, it will just update the DP.
