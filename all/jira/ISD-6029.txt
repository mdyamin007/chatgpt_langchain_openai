title: Scanner - Introduce Pre-Ingestions Commands
description: Add preing-doc, preing-enotice, and preing-etax.

For these processes, they will work exactly like doc, enotice and etax respectively, except for the fact that when the command is sent to PUI, the additional parameter "byPassDtJobId:true" will also be sent.
