Have you already sent the sample to customer?

Thanks

comment: Hi [~rony],

I have not. I need the signed work order from WASH. I also need QA to review the sample before I send to client.

Thanks,

It's not in QA folder, please reexport dfa into QA folder.

comment: Hi [~berezinez]

hmm wait, it's just sample review, not qa turnover that we do normally after client approval, right? If sample looks ok, then ask [~dyuen]to send to client after client approval I will turn over to qa, with parallel id dpvs project.



Thanks,

Please provide the project to Alis in the the QA folder. This needs to go through QA before I submit to client.

Customer reviewed samples and is asking:

"Is it possible to add Statement Date to the left of this date so that customers know what the date represents?"
