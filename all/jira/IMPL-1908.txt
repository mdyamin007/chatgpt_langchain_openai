comment: [~phoebe.george]please create separate IS JIRAs (at least 3) as they will go to 3 different programmers.

comment: [~yameelee] Sorry about that, I created 3 stories total, let me know how you want me to label based on how the programmers will be assigned. Thanks!

comment: [~zhuoxinT] [~Natalie.Tom] [~SamV2021] Because the 21st is a holiday, FCBT/PLBA will want to release on 2/22 instead. They do not have any large files arriving over the weekend, but just in case, we want to do this during the week, rather than going into a weekend.



Thanks!
