Will you please create a parallel form ?

Thanks!


author: JIRAUSER10912
comment: Hi [~TunA] 

According to *TS - 33166*, parallel testing is complete. So We need to release this.

Here is the transfer form :[^IS_PROGRAM_TRANSFER_FORM-2.doc]
Resources are available in :*/d/is/cvs/xfer/rumanB*


Thanks


author: tuna
comment: Hi [~rumanb]

I think parallel is not completed yet, per TS-33166 comment#5 ( 9/16/2022 6:58 AM). The last status is "DPVS released to TXOPS." by Jose. I don't see LASER print and confirmed.

Please confirm with LASER and Zoom message me if we should remove.

Thanks,

Tun
