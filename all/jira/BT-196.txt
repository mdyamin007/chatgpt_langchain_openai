I believe the banner name is standard and not configurable. It's the same for all statements applications.

comment: [~eric.yan], I'm afraid you are wrong. See below:

Enotice is a separated application from statements.

comment: [~eric.yan], and ARM Letter is not a statement, it is a notice about interest rate and payment terms changes.

It's even in the text: {color:#00875a}*WHY ARE YOU RECEIVING THIS NOTICE?*{color}

{color:#172b4d}I would like to see the document called ARM Letter, but if it is not possible (which seems weird to me), at least make it a notice.{color}

comment: [~Juliana Vannik], [~phoebe.george] FYI

IM confirms this application is a notice, not a statement

Yes, I understand the "ARM Letter" is a notice by its business sense.

However, enotice is a *single application*, which has the tab displayed as "Notice". And "Statement" is a different application *type*, which allows the setup of separate applications, like the "ARM Letter" in this case. And all "statement" application types would have "Statement" displayed on the tab.

So it's not possible to change it to "Notice" in the tab in our current application architect.
