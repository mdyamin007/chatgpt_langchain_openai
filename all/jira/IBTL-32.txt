comment: [~rodriguez]: Can you retry again? I think during that week were moving and shutting down the IPAS authentication system. If it still doesn't work with the same error, pleaser re-assign back to me.



Thanks!

comment: [~ernestw]: Can you take a look at this ticket please to see if this is a Papyrus authentication issue.

comment: Leo, would you try 1 more time?

comment: [~ernestw]: Made it through the format step, key error is no longer an issue. Big AFP and txt file produced.

[~William.Kong]: After the format step the script exited with an error. Looks like it is a DB connection issue occurring in the "get_infotrac.pl" script.

comment: [~ernestw]: Thanks Ernest for the assist! May I ask what was the resolution?



[~rodriguez]: Thanks Leo for re-testing. I will keep this ticket assigned to me since database is a global issue. Once the database is setup (new tentative date of 8/21), i will reassign this ticket back to you for continued testing.

comment: [~rodriguez]: Thanks for the prompt response... i guess I need to install SQLDeveloper on the Brisbane jumpstation to troubleshoot so that I can inform our DBA to review.
