Maybe I am missing something but I don't see the enrollment status in the report.

Thanks, Barnett

comment: Hi [~barnetts] ,

The format the client wanted was:

Member #, Date of Enrollment, CIF #.



This report is for checking accounts enrolled through sso disclosures.

Please see GECU question below:
Per GECU, For the sample report is that just sample data or was the report generated based on our data. The reason my team is asking is that there is a couple of Member # with x or that are invalid as well as some account numbers.
