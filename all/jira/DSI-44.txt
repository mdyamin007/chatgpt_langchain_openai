comment: Please check to see if the user_role already exists for the account. There is a complaint about a constraint but i believe that's in regards to the user already existing. The role seems to get inserted regardless of that constraint. So a user can have two links to the same role and that does not seem to be fixable from the UI. I'm also having trouble deleting the users to test again. what other constraints does usr have in the infotrac database?

The password also seems to be inserted into the DB in plaintext.

comment: I have fixed the issues. Please download the latest code in the zip InfotracUserInsertion.zip

The password issue is also resolved.

To delete a user you have to first delete the roles then you can delete them or you can delete them from the infotrac UI
