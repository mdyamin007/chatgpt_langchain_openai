title: Estatement Replica VM Setup
description: Hesham,



Per my discussion with Kent, can you create the following replica in prepare for the load balancer testing. Some of the Server name has not registered on the DNS server so you might need to go by IP.




||Clone From Server Name||IP||Clone To Server Name||New Server IP||
|ca-hypercube-pr-01|10.4.18.41|ca-hypercube-pr-02||
|ca-infotrac-pr-01|10.4.18.43|ca-infotrac-pr-02||
|ca-prism-pr-01|10.4.18.49|ca-prism-pr-02||
|ca-apipui-pr-01|10.4.18.45|ca-apipui-pr-02||
|ca-afp2web-pr-01|10.4.18.63|ca-afp2web-pr-02||
|||||





Thanks
