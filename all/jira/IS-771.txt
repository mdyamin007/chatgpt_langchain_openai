Any update on samples? These were due yesterday.


author: nischala.manjunath
comment: [~Kbittmann] - This requires more changes. Just updating the control files as mentioned in the description didn't work as expected. I was discussing this with [~yameelee] and we need to update the script but as these apps use a core script - isis.sh we may need to write a new, separate script to handle this.


author: JIRAUSER10911
comment: [~nischala.manjunath]



Could you please provide a new sample date?


author: yameelee
comment: H [~Kbittmann],

Sorry, I did not check the scripting for this job and so underestimate the job by quite a lot.

This will require another extra 14hrs for Nischala to add two new processing scripts in order to add the infotrac for these two applications.Peter said we will keep the client quote the same.

Since these won't be needed until next tax season we will delay it a bit as Nischala has some new job setups that needs to go LIVE towards end of march.

So the new dates will be

QA sample 4/15

Client Sample 4/19

client sample 4/20

client approval 4/25

LIVE 5/2. Thanks

comment: [~Kbittmann]/[~jharvey] we are delaying this project again to work on ticket #22037 as that one has to be LIVE on 5/7 and we do not have any more resources.

New Timeline

QA sample 5/19

Client Sample 5/23

client approval 5/25

LIVE 6/1. Thanks

comment: [~Kbittmann] - I'm unable to post estatements for 1098 and ISD mentioned that etax is not set up for snfb. Please advise. 
[~gthillaivel] - FYI
Thanks!


author: JIRAUSER10911
comment: [~nischala.manjunath]

ISD is correct. There is no E for 1098. On another note, there is no release button on Info Trac for the client to hit an approval button.


author: nischala.manjunath
comment: [~Kbittmann] - The approval button is for online proofing and we didn't enable that. I just added infotrac and track_by_rec.


author: nischala.manjunath
comment: [~Kbittmann] - I enabled advanced olp and reprocessed the jobs on pilot as requested.

Per the client:
I see those now and was able to test using them. I approved one and disapproved the other. Did notice on the disapprove there is a verbiage change needed.
