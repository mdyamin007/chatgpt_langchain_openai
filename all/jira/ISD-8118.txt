Hi Shun, the prefix for this application is: ewbbdna.

Could you please post this index file to pilot:dna_10172022_1_20221114_1533_star.txt

No resources need to be uploaded.

Thanks,
 Sam

comment: [~SamV2021] [~phoebe.george] I noticed the letter codes in the SOWs are 301-318 while the index file contains letter codes 001-018. Can you advise what the values should be so that I can add the descriptions accordingly into our database? Thanks!

Hi Shun, I just confirmed with Phoebe that we'll be going with letter codes 001-018. She will update the SOW accordingly.

Thanks,
Sam

comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] [~SamV2021] Per our zoom chats, I have updated the SOW's with the code information for 001 - 018.

Thank you!
 Phoebe

comment: [~phoebe.george] [~SamV2021] So I looked into the regular daily notice project, which i believe is ISD-7631, and found that letter codes 001-018 are already being used per the SOW on that story. On ISD's end, we can only assign one enotice description per letter code, regardless what type of notice or prefix.

Initially I would suggest we use the 300s, however I found another project ISD-7806 where the letter code 301 is already being used. Please advise, thanks!

comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] [~SamV2021] We need to switch back to the 300 series then.

[~SamV2021] I will update the SOW, but can you update program to use 300 - 318 instead? Please confirm how long it will take for you to update for eNotice posting.

[~Shun.Kuwashima] I am actually letting Sean know that I will be cancelling ISD-7806. STAR has opted to move this notice to the regular daily notice application post launch, as they want it to be for both print and electronic now. 

Please proceed with using 301 for this application instead.

comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] Attaching updated SOW.

Sorry, we had some of the InfoCodes incorrect on the SOW based on what Sam coded for. We are staying with the 300 series, but some of the codes were duplicated and we have corrected it. But now, some of the notices are out of sequence. Please check revised table. Sorry about that!

comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] I have approval for pilot site to move forward! I'm trying to get QA squeezed in, and I know this is sooner than the original due date to try and go live early part of next week if QA completes and IS is able to!

Thanks again for setting up so quickly on this project!

comment: [~phoebe.george] [~SamV2021] The letter codes/descriptions are on stage. The index files were initially autoposted onto stage, however I had to repost dna_20221017_1_20221115_1621_star.txt file because some letters only appeared once in the index file and those accts did not exist in our stage database. I ran into this error "infoTrac_flag is on but dt_job_id is missing from dataTrac(IS) database" while attempting to post. In the meantime I bypassed the dtjobid in order to post it for viewing on Infotrac Account Management/API testing. Not sure if we need to verify estatement job status, if not then we're good to go for QA.

comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] I'm so sorry, but can you re-post the index files from Sam in the previous comment?

Letters 301-318 (except 314 & 315): dna_20221017_1_20221115_1621_star.txt
Letter 314: dna_20221018_1_20221115_1626_star.txt
Letter 315: dna_20221025_1_20221115_1624_star.txt



I believe they were accidentally taken down when we were removing cycles for the dla setup on pilot.

Thanks!
