Thanks for your detailed testing. I don't believe those format values have quite significant or any effect on output because if you notice other letters 001-058 you will also see quite a mismatch with the sow. So I strongly believe, it will be ok if leave like this.

But let me know if you think we must change.

Can we pass this one? If needed put a note like the developer said it would be ok.



Thanks
