title: PUI - Accumulative OptOut Report Threshold
description: Update Accumulative OptOut Report to send out email alert if the number of records in the generated file is more than the configured amount for a CID. This is to address an issue for SSCU, but it can be used for other CID's if needed. If no threshold set, then no alert will be sent. The email recipient can be configured per CID.

I have a few queries regarding this task.
 # My understanding is that the alert email will be send internally. Should I send the alert email to "isd-staff@infoimageinc.com" for all environments?
 # I am using a new flag in cid.conf to define the threshold value (_accumulativeOptOutReport.recordThreshold_). What will be the value for this flag? Also, please give your feedback about the name of the flag.
 # If the total number of records in the generated file is more than the threshold value, should we stop the report generation proces beside sending the alert email?

1. The email can be send externally. Use any email for testing in the lower environment. Use digital.banking@safecu.org for prod.
2. The name is fine. Set it to 200.
3. Only alert is enough.

comment: To QA,

Please test this task by running an Accumulative OptOut report for SSCU.

If the report has more records than the threshold (configured in the cid.conf file), pre-defined recipient(s) will get an email. Checkout Sean's comment for email content.

Threshold configured: 200 (If report has more records than 200, email will be sent)

Email sender configured in conf file: [data_center@infoimageinc.com|mailto:data_center@infoimageinc.com]

Email recipients configured in conf file: [andrey.kutsenko@infoimageinc.com|mailto:andrey.kutsenko@infoimageinc.com](If QA assignee is different, then the recipient should be changed, so that he/she will get the email).
