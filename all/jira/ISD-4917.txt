title: SSOEnrollmentAPI research 
description: confirm my findings:
ssoEnrollmentAPI (user/enrollment) is called only during the ssoExchange step.
The ssoEnrollmentAPI call never pass email address information to Infoservice.
During the enrollment steps/profile, a different API is called to enroll account and register email address/sms.

ssoEnrollmentApi is called from below routes:
1. /ssoValidation
2. /ssoExchange
As far as I know, /ssoValidation route is not hit from anywhere.

______________________________

The ssoEnrollmentAPI call*pass* email address information to Infoservice.
Email address is passed inside accounts object (nested object notifyPref).

During the enrollment steps/profile,
*updateUserAccountsApi* is called to enroll account and register email address/sms.

Is that email nested inside each account, or is it its own individual object?

Can you provide a high-level of what the accounts data structure look like? Maybe create a Confluence Page for it, too, so everyone can keep referencing it.

Thanks,

I don't know if you had the chance to look into the wiki page Mamun has attached earlier. If you are okay with the structure, then we can close this one out. Let us know.

Thanks
