title: MSBK - [31291][pvt] Account Purge Request
description: SBK would like to know if we are able to combine their request for an account list that has not had any activity in 24 plus months with the account purge setup. They would like to have the report created, them validate it, then us use it to purge the accounts in our system. They would like to setup the purge as an ongoing process but only whenever they send a file, not on a set time frame. They anticipate this to happen approximately once a year, when they do an acquisition or merger, but they don't have a concrete timeline.



-----------------per Sean----------------------------------------

New Timeline

Turnover: 9/9

Live: 9/21



The client is requesting a couple things:

Generate a list of all accounts who do not have any statements/notices/taxes dated in the past 24 months
Once client validates it, they want us to setup the purge account process in order to purge the list of accounts as well as moving forward around once every year.


I was thinking 3 hours for each item, totaling to 6 hours altogether for setup/testing. Although there is no code change/server restart necessary, I think we should give more time since it involves multiple parts and also client validation in the middle of it. I provided a tentative timeline below, let me know if the assessment should be adjusted.

comment: Hi [~jharvey], I have compiled a list of all account numbers/types that have no statements, enotices, or etaxes dated within the last 24 months. Fyi there are a lot of accounts, 287,192 in total. Please have the client take a look.

Client has not responded, in the last meeting I had with them on 09/27 they were just beginning to review the list we provided.  I am going to update the Go Live date to 10/28 for now, until we have an update from them.

comment: Hi [~jharvey], is the client still reviewing the list I provided them? It's been almost 2 months since this story was created, was wondering if we should still keep this open. Or if you could at least push out the live date, that would be appreciated. Thanks

Client is still working on reviewing the list.  I pushed the live date to 11/30 for the time being.
