title: PUI - eNotice to create default paperless stmt_type
description: Check the enotice registrars, for some of them, they don't insert any paperless records, which creates issues later on different areas. Sometimes it doesn't create any paperless records. There maybe a flag, but we want it to do it by default.

Coding is done. I've deployed my changes on dev server and doing some testing. I'll deploy to pilot after testing is finished on dev.
