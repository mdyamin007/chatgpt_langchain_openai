1) Both forms on front and back needs to be replaced (S1VWCUD8.300, S1VWCUD9.300)
2) On the new pdf, section A has moved to the next page which means the input data from the screenshot below needs to be reposition
3) Update /home/test/keep/xml_tables/vwcudla4.table and /home/test/keep/xml_tables/vwcudla5.table
Add NewDataSet.Table.Adverse_x0020_Action_x0020_Reason_x0020_Counter field to the end of record 100 in both tables
