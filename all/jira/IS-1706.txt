comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com],

If there are too much HIC info in data that, in statement data overflows to next page, then should we display it in simplex page or duplex page?

However in SOW it is simplex, still I want to confirm.

Thanks


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: Hi [~mahbubS]- SURU is asking for duplex. They'd like to see a sample first before making a decision.


author: mahbubs
comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com],

Both MS1 and MS2 program has been updated of this task along with the duplex update.

In production, I looked for the data but didn't find onethat client mention in the ts.

 !image-2022-10-18-17-15-10-974.png!

So I ran the ms1 and ms2 process using the latest cycle. However the latest cycles don't have multiple HIC fields. Samples are attached.

MS1 sample:[^surums1317.sam.pdf]

MS2 sample:[^surums22174.2o1.pdf]

Please request client to provide the data files that has multiple HIC fields.

Thanks

comment: Hi [~mahbubS]- It's still not going to a separate page. Is there a way you can add more HIC fields to the data so we can create a mockup? Or you can forward the data file to me and I'll update it.


author: mahbubs
comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com],

I populated mockup data in the data file and ran the process.

Now the statement goes to the next page in the sample.

comment: I tested ms1 & ms2 projects by modifying test files to contain different numbers of transaction lines. Everything seems to be in order. I don't quite like that the last line may be orphaned (TOTAL AMOUNT line may be going to the last page alone), but that is purely aesthetical.

Good for client review.
