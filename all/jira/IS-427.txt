Please see the below client feedback and advise.


The estatement pilot site changes look good. On the attached samples of statements, on the first page of the statement, below the footer, the backer number and revision date is showing. Will that be on the finished statements?

The backer number and revision date has always been showing on the first page of DDA e-statements and archival. I just verified this on production infoTRAC. Only modification made to code was the addition of backers. If they would like us to remove the backer number and revision date from the first page, then that would require a separate job request for that change.

comment: [~Kbittmann]: I need [~Peter.Dang]& [~rodriguez]to advise.



[~Peter.Dang]/[~rodriguez]: This project is+way overdue+ (i.e. 10/29/2021). Please see if we can get this rolled out by EOM if there is no code conflicts with the existing version of the code. If it cannot make it before EOM, then please advise the next available time slot.

I think we should be able to release before EOM since this change is only for archival and e-stmt. However, I will need to discuss with Peter tomorrow at at team meeting and let him make the final call/new live date.

comment: [~rodriguez]: Did you confirm with [~Peter.Dang] that you can release the code before EOM? If so, update the due date to reflect the release date that you guys agreed to. Thanks!

We agreed on a live date of 12/10. We concluded that an EOM release is cutting it close since its a holiday week and EOM processing will be going on next week. We also decided that this will need a full parallel test.
