comment: QA,

This update to GCBKEA31.dfa to display the 'actual escrow balance' for anticipated payments spanning two lines in 'Escrow History' is complete. Please review.
 * Exported updated project files to\\download-nas02\qa\GCBK\GCBKEA31.zip
 * Attached DPVS:[^gcbkea1127_dpvs.pdf]
 * IS checklist attached:[^gcbkea1_is-1718_check_list.pdf]

Below is a screenshot of the issue prior to this update. The last entry
 'Anticipated MGIC PMI - Monthly PMI' does not have an actual escrow balance. Please refer to the samples provided to see this fix.

comment: Hi [~SamV2021], please see feedback from GCBK:

When reviewing the sample, we noticed that the word "anticipated" and the description of the payment from escrow should be in the same line. Is it possible to make that adjustment?

Can this be done? If so, can you provide an updated sample?

Thanks!

comment: Hi [~SamV2021], just some more feedback from GCBK:



It loops/carries over on other lines but didnt on the lines like Erika noted below. Here is an example from the January file.

Hi Igor, I have made additional programming changes to GCBKEA31.dfa in order to combine the 'Anticipate' and 'MGIC PMI - Monthly PMI' lines as requested by the client in Daphne's comment above. Please review.

Here is a screenshot showcasing this fix:

comment: Hi [~SamV2021], I took a quick look at the revised samples and noticed one account in particular only has "Anticipated" in the lines. Page 3 in the sample; here is a screenshot as well. Can you advise to what that is? Should it also be "Anticipated MGIC - PMI..." or is it just "Anticipated"?

Hi Daphne, the one you showed should just be 'Anticipated' as that is what is in the data file. There is no additional description following that line.

Thanks,
Sam

Updated sample sent to GCBK for review/approval.


author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~SamV2021], samples are approved!

Per GCBK: "This looks good to move forward with. "

We probably need print samples but I didn't see any print accounts in the dpvs, it appears to only be e.... Also is there any possibility of this update being released early Monday so that GCBK can have the eStatements approved and released by 5pm PST?

comment: Hi [~SamV2021], I spoke with [~rodriguez]on Friday while you were OOO. He said that we don't need parallel and [~Igor.Khosid] confirmed that we can bypass print samples. Please release ASAP so that DP can reprocess the LN file for GCBK to review samples.

Thanks!
