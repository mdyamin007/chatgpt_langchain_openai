title: BRIL:[pvt][34476] Setup Paperless File and Undeliverable Email Report
description: Set-up two files for BRIL to mirror setup for EQBK to create:
1. Paperless file containing delivery preferences (this will be placed back to EQBK to same client pickup folder)
2. Undeliverable Email Report (this will be placed back in EQBK to same client pickup folder).

ISD Assessment:
EQBK does have paperless file and it contains delivery preferences. The paperless file is sent to us from them. This will take 3 hours.
EQBK does have undeliverable email report setup. This will take 3 hours.

Can the client provide a paperless file, so that I can post it on pilot to test? Thanks!

Here is a sample undeliverable report generated from pilot.

comment: [~mac] Thanks! I have sent to EQBK/BRIL for approval.

For the paperless file, that is something that should be provided internally based on enrollment, correct? Please let me know, as I don't believe this would be sent by client.

Hi Phoebe,

I checked, EQBK sends their Paperless file to us. Is there a way to get a BRIL Paperless file I can test for Pilot?


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~mac] Thanks - can you confirm the file name for EQBK? I'll confirm if they have started generating this for BRIL already.

Hi Phoebe, any update on if they generate the BRIL file?


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~mac] I actually just got feedback today! From customer:

_Can we get Brilliant's columns to match Equity's columns?_


Equitys undeliverable columns = CIF NUMBER|ACCOUNT NUMBER|EMAIL 
ADDRESS|CODE|REASON|DATE
Brilliants undeliverable columns = CIF NUMBER|ACCOUNT NUMBER|APP 
CODE|ACCOUNT HOLDER NAME|EMAIL ADDRESS|CODE|REASON|DATE

Remove Brilliant's columns: App Code, Account Holder Name

Hi Phoebe, he is the newly generated report with removal of App Code and Account Holder Name.

Also, any word on the Paperless file that they are generating?

Thanks!

I followed up on paperless file again as well, they are working to send. Thanks!
