title: WASH - [24859][pvt] e-disclosure update
description: Update eStatement disclosure



I have attached a PDF but the disclosure today is .jps page.

[https://estatements.watrust.com/disclosure.jsp]

- The top line on this page states "Welcome to Online Statements". I want to update to "eStatement Disclosure"
 - In the past When updating certain disclosures it requires all users to re accept. I do not want users to re accept but change the current language.



1 hour to update text within the disclosure content.

Tentative timeline:

Development start: 1/5

Pilot: 1/12

Approval: 1/13

Live: 1/19

No Parallel required.
