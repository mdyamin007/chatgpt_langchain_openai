title: No check on account# / address when combining multipage notices
description: When combining multipage notices into one, a check if account # and address lines are the same needs to be made as per mapping comment:

_to break accounts we need to also look at the account number and the address block as we need to combine those into one._

It looks like there are some unfinished checks in the project code, but as of now notices separated by ** CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE ** with different account #s and addresses can be combined into one.
 Expected result: error message with the notice details + execution halted.

I already add the defensive logic to check for double nesting.
If you edit the account number on subsequent pages then program should catch it.
For account name, it's very tricky to extract account name on subsequent page and it's not feasible at the moment.
If program can catch different account number then I think it's good to prevent double nesting.
