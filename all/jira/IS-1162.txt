Development id:20220901073752.

Note: parallel id has another update ongoing in the same resources. Hence, couldn't upload the resources to parallel and provide the dev id.

index file ds1_20220808_1_20220906_0332_whcu.txt. Please post this to *pilot.*

WHCUDS11.zip is in QA folder.

Thanks



Hi [~Ricky Lopez]sorry for the late response but it's better to go through parallel too. So would it be possible to extend the time by 1 more week?



Thanks

comment: Hi [~Ricky Lopez]

I believe developer doesn't create parallel form, they just fill it. Please talk to [~phoebe.george]if you are not sure.
