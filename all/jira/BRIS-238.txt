Can you confirm SSH works? If needed we can add those ports, but the action upon the requested access looks correct.

comment: Thanks, Kent for your reply

We were trying to access the older pd-dev* server set.

pd-dev5.infoimageinc.com 10.8.9.136
pd-dev3.infoimageinc.com 10.8.9.76
pd-dev7.infoimageinc.com10.8.9.198
pd-dev6.infoimageinc.coms 10.8.9.137
pd-dev9.infoimageinc.com 10.8.9.209

comment: Hi [~nazmul.islam]



So as I said, port 22 is enabled. Are you requesting additional ports to be open?


author: nazmul.islam
comment: Yes, these are the ports -

*Ports:*
 # 22 (ssh)
 # 80 & 443 (proxy)
 # 1433-1435 (mssql)
 # 27017-27020 (MongoDB)
 # 1521 (oracle)
 # 5900-5920 (VNC)
 # 8000-9000 (appserver)

3-6 will be used for End 2 End testing

comment: [~davidt]-Clarify something for me

the OLD group is no longer needed, and the NEW group and the port numbers provided is what's needed?

Or both OLD and NEW is needed, along with the port numbers? Also for what user group is this for? Arashful_jannet?

comment: Kent,

Please give access to both old and new for the ports that Naim provided.
