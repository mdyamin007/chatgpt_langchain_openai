title: Paginated Data Table for Batch Download
description: None

comment: Hi [~tai.trinh],

What I have done so far is created a datatable in which all the account numbers are shown. In that datatable account can be searched by account number or description.

I also created a dropdown button that is populated with distinct account description. As there are more than 16 distinct account description so I created dropdown rather than buttons of account description. If a specific description is selected from that dropdown then the account numbers are grouped according to that description and are shown in the datatable. Here are the screenshots:

At this moment Account# "Select All" checkbox can only select all the visible account numbers in the datatable. Is it the expected behavior?

Please let me know what should be the exact behavior of Select All checkbox.

I haven't committed the code yet.

For your information, Friday and Monday are Govt. holidays here, so I will start working on it from Tuesday.

Thanks,

This is good. I will check with the client on how they want to the Select All feature to behave.

The client is okay with all of these UI changes. One change that will need to be made is that the Account Type should be in the left column along with the Account#, Document Type, etc.

Please proceed to QA/commit, and release onto Pilot. I have provided the client with target Pilot date of 8/12, but it is always better if we can get it out sooner.

Thanks,
Tai

I have done the code for msm. Tomorrow I will take those code to eStatement Site (ROOT) also. I think we can start testing after that.

Yes, this is fine. I assume this is not committed to trunk yet? If possible, please have it committed and deployed to Pilot on Monday.

Thanks,
