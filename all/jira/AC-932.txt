Need to display encrypted account no besides account no

Client expected output is :

*****8727795C2TC7RC(masked entireaccount no + <space>+encrypted account) . Per client in comment 16 both can be of max 10 length and since client wants an space between those while displaying total length we need is 21.

Currently for 1098 :

It is using 21,40 position for display and

751-770 position for index file for segment 1, 21-40 for segment 2 and 3.

We can put the account no and encrypted account no in column 751-771 (length 21) for display (since we need to put a space between account no and encrypted account no ), and the account no for index in 21-40.

So we need to set a rule with field 751-771 for tax_acctnum_main table in tax_insert_table.sql file



INSERT INTO tax_acctnum_main (ref_number,start_pos,end_pos,split_by,remove_zeros,acct_pos_loc,suf_pos_loc,suf_display, acct_n_suf_order) VALUES ('77','751','771','blank','1','blank','blank','as_is', 'a');

which we will use for display.



and for e_index we need to change for tkcu segment 1 which is using rule 50 currently. We can change to use rule 1 instead.

So overall for tax_acctnum_ref table



CID | FORM | SEGMENT | DISPLAY | E_INDEX |

tkcu|1098|1|751|1|

tkcu|1098|2|751|47|

tkcu|1098|3|751|48|

tkcu|rest|all|751|1|



there is already a preprocessing script for 1098 tkcu_1098_spec_handle.pl where it puts member number from cross reference file to irs data file in position 751-770 position. And it is taking account no from 21-40 position and ssn from 12-20 position to match with cross reference file. We have to build another preprocessing script for all tkcu forms which will be called before tkcu_1098_spec_handle.pl per tax process, we will put account no, space , encrypted account no combination in field 751-771 for display. And,

we need to make a slight change in tkcu_1098_spec_handle.pl, instead of putting member no in 751-770 put this in 21-40 , so basically we will replace the account no with member no for 1098.
