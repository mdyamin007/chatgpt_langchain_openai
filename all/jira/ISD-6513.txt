title: IVBK: eNotice Setup (Resume project)
description: Resume project started with JEF #47985 for IVBK setup for print notices and HTML eNotices for Ivy Bank.


Currently, there will be 4 new notices for setup.

(NOTE): IS to confirm new dates to resume.

SOW to be added with details for 4 new notices (2 completed for samples)


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~phoebe.george] The description on this story mentions 4 new notices, but on the IS ticket and print SOW it mentions 3. Can you confirm if these are the correct letter codes/descriptions we need to add?:
001 - Overdrawn Account Notice
003 - Certificate of Deposit Maturity Notice
006 - Notice of Insufficient Funds

comment: Updating date to May 31 to match IS story

Also I noticed live date is today 5/31, can we update it? Thanks


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] Thanks, I updated the due date for now, but still pending a confirmation from IS on the new timeline.

Note that the logo isn't displaying on the pilot, I will confirm with DSI on their story.

comment: [~phoebe.george] I was able to post these index files successfully on pilot.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] I received approval on the pilot site and informed DSI. Please let me know next steps to move forward in preparation for QA.

I don't know the new target live date yet, I'm pending feedback from DSI on the dates and will let you know.

Thanks!


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~phoebe.george] Since most of the enotice setup was already done prior, my part just involves updating resources and adding new letter code descriptions which should already be done on stage. We should be ready for QA to start testing.


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: Hi [~phoebe.george], I noticed DSI mentioned a potential live date of 8/12, so I'm going to update the due date for this story as well. Please update it afterwards if there are any changes, thanks!

comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] [~tohidulI] [~Andrey.Kutsenko] I reviewed the bugs and added my comments. All items noted are not show-stoppers in order to move forward. There are two items that I will create a TS ticket for post-launch update and/or review to confirm for fixes. If not other bugs/issues, please confirm once QA is ready to pass.

comment: QA is completed (based on comment [~phoebe.george]).


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~phoebe.george], most of the enotice updates were already setup before I started working on this, the only thing I released was the enotice codes/descriptions for 001, 003, and 006 and the resource S1IVBKGL.300 to production.

Also just fyi, enotice emails were initially setup with a manual trigger, not sure if that was because the project was not fully live yet in the past. Should this remain on manual or should we update it to be automatic?


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~phoebe.george] enotice emails are now setup to be automatic. Everything else has been setup already or released earlier today, closing story.
