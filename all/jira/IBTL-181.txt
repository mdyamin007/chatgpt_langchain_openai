comment: Rogelio,

Please check, the file has been scan.

Seem like the server got rebooted sometime between yesterday and today so it stopped the scanner.



Thanks

comment: syntax error. $env\{database} should be call instead of $database. I updated both Menlo and parallel env. Please try to process again. [~William.Kong]
