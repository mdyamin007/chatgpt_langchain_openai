comment: [~jira_naru] SANA Feedback part 1:
 * I know we said that we thought we could use the same logic as our current mortgage statements however, when reviewing the samples provided and comparing them to the MH samples we provided, we noticed that the format does not match what we currently have mapped for our mortgage samples. It looks like FICS may have made some updates to the statement format/layout since we mapped our mortgage statements back in 2017. We will discuss this internally but in the meantime, the MH statements need to be mapped according to the MH samples we provided. Below are some of the fields identified:
 * On the regular statement (non-bankruptcy) there should be a section on the right with Account Information.
 * The Maturity Date and Prepayment Penalty fields on the left side need to be included under the Account Information on the right side.


 * The sample for loan #1013848 has two transactions dated 10/07/21 and 10/13/21 that do not belong to this loan. In reviewing the data file, those transactions are for loan #1012290.
 * The address and phone number to the right of the logo are incorrect and should read as:

PO Box 721

San Antonio, TX 78293-0721

866-310-2143



Also, attached is some feedback Kerri provided as well. She has included some feedback on the bankruptcy statements as well.

comment: [~jira_naru] More feedback:

Here is additional feedback on statement sample for loan 1013848 (45 days Delinquent). I have attached a marked-up copy of the sample for reference:


 * Under the Important Messages section on page 1, it appears as though the logic for the carriage return that we said to remove because the messaging is not static was still programmed for. Please review.
 * The Delinquency Notice section:
 * Needs to be on a separate page, which would be page 3
 * Missing verbiage "The loan became delinquent on 09/20/21" This is located in record G5 of the data file
 * The verbiage Your loan became needs to say "The loan..".
 * Account History contains data that does not belong to this loan; it belongs to loan #1012290
 * Please capitalize each word "If You Are Experiencing Financial Difficulty"


 * The Loan Statement Disclosure needs to be moved up after the Transaction Activity section on page 2



We are meeting with the business unit on Monday morning to review the Accelerated and bankruptcy samples.

comment: [~kericapote]and [~ratnam]:

OK, I will look into those issues.

However, can you confirm the following:
 # Accelerated Statement, FICS document states that the verviage under Total Amount Due is from data, B27
 !image-2021-12-10-15-53-50-254.png! 
 Do you want to keep this logic or hardcode the verbiage?
 # For the return address, do you want me to hardcode the address to?
 !image-2021-12-10-15-57-41-438.png!
 # FICS document also provide samples for other 2 statement types I do not have template for:
 1. Reinstatement
 2. Loss Mitigation
 Would you be able to provide production sample(template) for these 2 statements?
 # For BK Mortgage chapter 7 and 13, is this verbiage to be hard coded?
  !image-2021-12-10-16-08-51-469.png!


author: kericapote
comment: Here are our responses to the questions below:
 # Please use the logic; B27
 # Please hardcode the return address on the MH Statements only to:

PO Box 721

San Antonio, TX 78293-0721

866-310-2143
 # Currently we do not have any live statement samples for Reinstatement or Loss Mitigation. Kerri will check on this and see if she can create test samples.
 # For Bankruptcy MH Statements, the Important Messages verbiage should use the logic in G13 (if applicable) and B25. For G13, each: is indicated as a bullet point on the statement. (see attachment).



We are working to get an new Bankruptcy data file to include loans that have data in G13 and/or G14.


author: jira_naru
comment: [~kericapote]:

So, this verbiage is from G13 and not hardcoded?

comment: Hi Nar, CU provided new disclosureComment Page.docx for the statement.

Also, they will be sending new data file for regular monthly statement including data for Accelerated andReinstatement along with Reinstatement sample by end of day today. There are few mapping changes in their sample that I will update before I turn over. 

Loss Mitigation statement is not part of set up. CU should provide sample feedback by EOD tomorrow so we can accommodate any changes in next sample.

Thanks

author: ratnam
comment: Hi Nar,

Below are couple more changes specific to Accelerated andReinstatement statements. Please note their statements differ from FICS sample.
 # CU wants to pull below highlighted fields in green from *B27*. !image-2021-12-16-19-14-40-380.png|width=324,height=165!
 # Move Maturity Date and Prepayment Penalty to below Unpaid Late Charges Balance replicating their regular statements. !image-2021-12-16-19-17-22-339.png|width=489,height=249! 



I copied below the feedback content from my email for reference -



CU sent new zip file SANA_MHSTMTS_121321_1.zip (which contains SANA_MHSTMT_121321_1 and SANA_MHSTMTBK_121321_1) if you are able to pick from test folder. If you are not able to pick the file, I already placed request to DP to copy the file to my secure share and I will let you know as soon as they copy. Attached are FICS current statement samples for the following loans:



+MHSTMT file contains the following loans+:
|Loan|DQ or Not||
|20265|DQ|Accelerated|

*Here is some additional feedback from the samples received today.* I have attached a mocked up copies of the samples with the feedback.

**

Statement Sample 1013848:

Page 1 - Loan Statement at the top of statement needs to be moved to top left, not centered. This applies to all statements.

Page 2 - Loan Statement Disclosures is not the correct text.

Page 3 
 * The Loan Number is missing from the top left of the page*
 * The statement date is missing from the top right of the page*

(* the Loan Number and Statement Date need to be included on Page 3  Delinquency Notice)



*Delinquency Notice*:

Missing verbiage "You are 46 days delinquent on your mortgage loan." This is static text with the number of days in *G5*.

(This verbiage is included on the samples for the accelerated loans (see loan 204665) but not the regular delinquency and needs to be included.)





Statement Sample Loan 104282 (Bankruptcy)

Page 1 
 * Loan Statement at the top of statement needs to be moved to top left, not centered. This applies to all statements.
 * Missing field "Accrued Late Charges" from B12 record
 * On Bankruptcy Statements, please remove the border from the Total Payment Amount
 * On the Bankruptcy Statements coupon portion, please remove the border from the Total Payment Amount

Page 2
 * The "Loan Statement Disclosures" should follow the "Bankruptcy Message". Is does not need to be on a separate page.

Please let us know if you have any questions.


author: jira_naru
comment: [~ratnam]:

For the last item, regarding the the 'Loan Statement Disclosure', The whole verbiage of the disclosure is one piece. Therefore, if the disclosure cannot all fit on remaining page, it will overflow over to the subsequent page. This behavior is common for all disclosure placed in statement.


author: kericapote
comment: [~jira_naru]Hi Nar - when will you be able to provide the new samples? Final sign off is due Monday and they need time to review.


author: ratnam
comment: Hi Nar, for the last item CU responded with below feedback. Can you please check if we can adjust.



*In response, we understand that in cases where there is a lot of transaction history, it may go to a second page but for the most part, we believe that it should fit on the same page. A visual observation shows that the one produced out of FICS starts the verbiage about a half inch further up than the one for InfoIMAGE so I am not sure if it can be brought up a little.*

comment: Hi Nar,

Please review below feedback. We may receive couple more changes as CU is still reviewing the samples.
 # Keri mentioned the margin on top of page 1 seem too high. Please confirm if that works with print. Also, if we are ok with top margin on page 1, CU wants content in page 2 and following pages to replicate the the same top margin.
 # CU do not want Delinquency Notice on their Bankruptcy statements. Example loan Number *20486*
 # Remove below logo from coupon

comment: [~jira_naru] also please advise when you will provide pdf archival samples.

Thx!


author: jira_naru
comment: [~ratnam]:

OK, I will make the update for 12.20.2021 feedback.

Archival sample will be ready once all changes completed to statement format.


author: ratnam
comment: Hi Nar, below is additional feedback from CU. We did let them know that this will be last round of changes unless there is a issue from our end. Please review and let me know if you have any questions.





*1. BK CH-13*

We need to remove the Delinquency Notice Section from the statement and instead you would add a bullet point to the beginning of the Important Messages that states:


 * We have not received all of your mortgage payments due since you filed for bankruptcy.

 !image-2021-12-21-08-50-05-496.png|width=507,height=166!





*2. BK CH-7*



Keep the Delinquency Notice Section on the statement but modify it to change the header to Account History and remove the verbiage below the header until you get to the Account History section. Remove Bold print on Total line. (We did not have an example of this on our file. I will need to run a new file to test this out.

!image-2021-12-21-08-50-46-964.png|width=415,height=154!



*3. BK CH-7 and CH-13*

**

*Payment Amount in upper right hand corner of the Statement should be populated using field C5.*

**

*InfoImage:*

* !image-2021-12-21-08-51-49-433.png|width=424,height=140!*

**

*FICS:*

* !image-2021-12-21-08-52-12-644.png|width=452,height=152!*

**

*4. Accelerated and Reinstatement*

**

*Contact Us Section*

**

The Contact Us Header was removed and the Phone and E-Mail was moved over to the right side in error. We are not sure why this was moved.



FICS:

 !image-2021-12-21-08-52-46-893.png|width=285,height=272!                                       InfoImage:



!image-2021-12-21-08-53-39-598.png|width=329,height=160!





*5. Loan Statement Disclosures*



Loan Statement Disclosures have the header for Access Information for Government Approved Housing Counselors centered instead of indented like the other headers.



FICS:

 !image-2021-12-21-08-54-23-471.png|width=484,height=90!





InfoImage:

 !image-2021-12-21-08-54-55-317.png|width=438,height=132!



*6. Expired Acceleration*



Loan 302290  The statement should have been a regular statement instead of a Accelerated Statement because there was nothing populated in the B27 field. This loan was past the accelerated end date and the system logic indicates this by not putting anything in the B27 field. The Acceleration had expired.



(B27 = Reinstatement/Accelerated/Loss Mit Amount Due Verbiage for Billing Information section)



Thanks

comment: Hi Nar, samples are approved. But CU requested one minor change below.Please let me know if it is possible to correct this?



We did find an issue, however, it is coded based on our feedback regarding the accrued late change for bankrupt loans. For Chapter 13 (G14) filings, we are not supposed to lay down the accrued late charge.

comment: [~jira_naru] SANA is asking:

Our current archival files have an .img extension on both the index and images. This was necessary because the auto import was trying to convert the image to a Pdf so the process was having hiccups trying to convert a Pdf to a Pdf. Is it possible for your team to replicate what we have in process for all of our other archival files?

author: kericapote
comment: [~jira_naru] SANA is asking:

two follow-up questions on the invalid mail address report.
 # Is it possible to include the FICS loan number?
 # In the sample report provided, are these accounts actually reflecting as bad addresses or were these just examples?


author: jira_naru
comment: [~kericapote]:
 # The fields you see in the report are our standard, it does not include FICS loan number.
 # Yes, there were no invalid address, in the most current test file, so the report was an example and does not reflect actual bad address.


author: kericapote
comment: [~jira_naru] so does that mean we can't modify it at all or does that mean we can and it might be more money and need a new time line?


author: jira_naru
comment: [~kericapote]:

No, we cannot modify to have FICs loan number.


author: kericapote
comment: [~jira_naru] Invalid address report has been approved. Please confirm that the invalid mail pieces will mail out (not suppress) and we will provide the invalid address report to client pick up per the SOW. We hope to have approval on the archival tomorrow or Wednesday.


author: jira_naru
comment: [~kericapote]:

Invalid address will be directed to MIS file.

This mean that you will need to provide OPS with instruction on how to handle them. Example, mail them out, return them to SANA or shred them.


author: kericapote

Since the SOW specification for archival file to be split by 5k pdf per zip. You need another number in each of the zip file to distinguish the number of zip files. Otherwise, the pdf will go into one zip file.

Since SANA was able to load the archival test file and approved it. It should be OK, archival was approved. Please update the SOW archival filenames to:

I have to search and see if you sent the email last Friday in response to my questions.
