The update is to not to display customer with emp code 1 in job status proof sample.

check [https://app.na3.teamsupport.com/?TicketNumber=24435]comment 90 to see the logic Will proposed.

and in comment 97 I explained my testing to William.

Coding logic is:

I am adding the value "n" in field381 of paper txt , if account + appl code match found between data vs cif file ( from where the emp code comes). Cif file entry looks like this:

21|JOHN BEMENT|JOHN BEMENT|14857928|00|JOHN||BEMENT|*1*|Savings

9th column is emp code. So if emp code is 1 I am adding "n" in paper txt file.

After that I am building the proof file from where the prf sample get generated with only those entries that doesn't have this n in 381 no column and the final proof sample will not include account that has emp code 1 ( "n" is paper txt ).



[^pfcums1228.zip]inside this zip file it has c1bmcok file ( which is paper txt file that contains all accounts ) and prf txt file which contains 1 account ( 707701701MARY ANN SHEPTOCK OR) from c1bmcok file and that account doesn't have n in 381 column. And with this account proof sample is built.

This is from stage.

Proof sample .



PFCUMS11.zip was already uploaded by Sakib in is-890.



I am quite not sure how will you test this but I tried to explain what I implemented.



Let me know if you need anything.



Thanks

Rony
