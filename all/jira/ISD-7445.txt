comment: [~MattL] For the rebranding, isn't there anything to change on the eStatement side (logo, disclosure, site verbiage, etc)?


author: mattl
comment: Can you confirm what you mean?


author: 5b1ee5a72eea651bacdeca2e
comment: [~MattL] There's a logo on the site, there are verbiages on the site with the Credit Union's name. If they are rebranding, don't they want to change those?

comment: [~thomasY] Let me know if there are any resources needed for uploading.

comment: Hi [~Shun.Kuwashima]

I am updating Hypercube for EPCU rebranding. I need the pdf that will be shown when users would click on the "eStatement Disclosure" button, located at the bottom of the right sided disclosure verbiage (please see attached screenshot_epcu_estatement_disclosure_btn.png_). Currently it is showing a pdf with TFCU logo on it (please see attached screenshot_epcu_estatement_disclosure_pdf.png_).

Thank you!

Azhar

comment: [~Azad] looks like a sample statement pdf, we would also need to update the sample pdf during shown during enrollment steps.

[~MattL] [~thomasY] Can you help provide an update sample statement pdf with the new logo so that Azhar can update it on the member site? See current sample pdf for reference epcu_estatement_disclosure_pdf.png provided by Azhar.

comment: Hi [~thomasY]Can you assist?


author: azad
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima]I am using_sample.pdf_ (see attachment) on enrollment step. Should I use this pdf for eStatement Disclosure button too? If not, then I will need that pdf. Otherwise, It's fine.

Please advise.

Thanks,


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~MattL] The 'eStatement disclosure' button on the member site currently opens a sample statement pdf rather than an actual disclosure. Can you advise whether it's ok to replace that with the new same sample.pdf for the enrollment steps? If so, then we don't need [~thomasY] to provide another sample pdf to us.


author: mattl
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima]Thats perfect!


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: Thanks for confirming [~MattL]!

[~Azad], you can go ahead and use the sample.pdf for the estatement disclosure button.

comment: Hi [~Shun.Kuwashima]are we good on this?


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~MattL] I think so, I double checked and all the resources Thomas provided here are uploaded onto all environments. We should be good to close this out if we're good on parallel and there are no further changes on IS end.


author: mattl
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] I'll likely be opening the parallel ticket for DN & Statements tomorrow.


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: Parallel passed, resources already uploaded. No other updates needed from ISD, closing story.
