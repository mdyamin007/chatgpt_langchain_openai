title: NTSB [21180] [pvt]  Global DDA Insert for Print and eStmt Request
description: his will take 4hrs programming for print and estmt.

create duplex insert starting on a new page, (add a blank page to the back of page if statement ends on front page).

The word doc and PDF are not the same. Which is the actual insert? Will need client to provide a finalized insert whether it is the PDF or word version on comment 1, (prefers PDF format).

The PDF is a bit blurry, once we convert it will be even more blurry. We will need a clearer PDF. If it is the word doc, prefers client to provide one without the highlights.

I cannot verify posting for Index file ms1_20210630_1_20210714_1246_ntsb.txt

It displays only the first two pages, no inserts, other pages are blank.

Please upload recourses. See sample attached.

comment: Hi Ya Mee,

The client noticed that on the paper samples, starting with the statement on page 69, there should be blank page after page 3 of the statement so that the insert starts on a new sheet. It is for William Robert Hart; can you take a look at that please?

Thank-you!

Here is the new paper sample. Had to change logic for the pages to count correctly when there are only 2 pages of data.

comment: Here is the new DPVS. I went through the file and put in accounts for statements with all the different number of statement pages (1,2,3,4,5 etc) in the qa list. I have reviewed the qa print files and all those that need the blank page has it and those that don't need it doesn't have it. The qa print file has over 400 pages from this.



You can request to have laser print the qa file, I think just images 1-31 should be ok or you can print more if needed - this only has statements with pages 1-5.

We need code released in order to process production file that is being held. Client called asking for ETA of when DPVS will be ready for review.
