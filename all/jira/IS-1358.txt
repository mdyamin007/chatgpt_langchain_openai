title: MSBK - [30906][pvt][in-house] DP -- SAME DAY -- MSBK Daily Letter 7/22/22 errors and variable messaging (did not finish processing)
description: This issue is caused by inconsistencies between the data file and programming assessment made in TS#23298. More specifically, it was not explicitly stated that the first byte/character of the line containing the account number and amount overdrawn could be a value other than '2', causing the account number and amount overdrawn to not be retrieved properly.



 

A programming change was not previously made to accommodate this. I will discuss with Peter regarding whether this formatting logic change can be released as a hotfix, or whether additional testing will be needed.

This hotfix to accommodate different values for the first byte/character of the line containing the account number and amount overdrawn in the data file has been made and uploaded to staging. This update has been made to all relevant format DFAs (MSBKDL009 - 012, MSBKDL051, and MSBKDL052).

 * DPVS attached:[^msbkdla222_dpvs.pdf]
 * Created test file containing data files taken from today's production cycle, and for MSBKDL010 and MSBKDL012, which did not have a corresponding data file, manually modified an older production file to have varying values for the first byte/character of the account number/amount overdrawn line.[^MSBK_DN_072222_02.zip]
 * Errors mentioned by Glenn in TS#30906 comment #1 are no longer present in the log files in /z/daily/msbk/
