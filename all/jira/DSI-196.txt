title: Wrapper service PUI integration
description: We are making an update for the Prism webapp to use the wrapper service to convert to PDF. We need to make the same update on the PUI side also. The AFP processing, document processing, and email attachment features all make requests to afp2web. For AFP and document processing, its using its own class to call afp2pdf server. We will need to update it to use the class in afp2pdf instead. We also need to review the email attachment feature to see if the implementation to call afp2web works with your change. If not, then we will need to update it.
