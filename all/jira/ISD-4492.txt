title: 19190 / 48225 - ACBK - Online Proofing for Notices
description: Online proofing is a tab on infotrac, IS will post samples to this tab so that the client can review and approve it before we actually post statements. ACBK already has online proofing enabled for their normal statements, so from our POV it's enabled for all apps as long as IS makes the appropriate updates too.
