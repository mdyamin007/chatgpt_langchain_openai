Hi [~barnetts]

Currently for slcums9 ( analysis report), it is not showing any endorsement line. So just confirming, do we need to show *Adress Service Requested* for this app?

Thanks

Yes, for cums9 ( analysis report), we will need to show Address Service Requested for this app.

Will it be a in-house update or update from client? Did you make mistake when working in jira https://jira.infoimageinc.com/browse/IS-1364 ?

So what you are asking to revert back the previous change?

If this is a request from client shouldn't you charge them for this? This is not my problem , just asking.



Let me know.

comment: Hi [~rony] / [~misbah.uddin@dsinnovators.com],

This is an inhouse change. There was and still is a lot of confusion around this request. This is one of the corrections for something that was missed on our end.
