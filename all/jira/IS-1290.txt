comment: Hi [~Ricky Lopez]

This is for 5498 and 1099r right, according to ts [https://app.na3.teamsupport.com/?TicketNumber=25947?]

I will use these files to provide sample mentioned in comment 24 in the ts:

!https://app.na3.teamsupport.com/dc/1888578/images/03e80dc6-78c6-495b-a429-c800355b982f.png!



But I will also need an xref file which they sends while processing for existing tax forms .



Thanks

comment: Hi [~Ricky Lopez]

Want to confirm the following with the client:

In the cross-reference file:

!image-2022-08-24-17-35-21-104.png!

1st column is member no, 2nd account no, 3rd account type. Is it correct?

We need to display plan numbers (record B, 21-31 ) in 1099r and 5498 forms. Is it correct?



Thanks

comment: [~rony] Here is the information that PFCU provided based on the xref file:

Tax Data Files:
 * 5498 and 1099R
 * Account number - rec B pos 21-33
 * Account number - rec B pos 21-33
 * If the last two digits in the account number are '00' then query the xref using appl-code 95, otherwise use appl-code 96



Tax Xref file - will help map the account number and appl-code derived from the tax data file to the Member number so that the tax forms are uploaded under the member number TX record at InfoIMAGE.



Tax Form
 * Only show the plan number on the tax forms (the plan number is the account number without the last two digits)
 * Mask the SSN to only show the last four



Let me know if best to setup a call to discuss this feedback. 

Thanks!

comment: Hi [~rony]please attach IS checklist.
Thanks.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~Andrey.Kutsenko] [~rony] Please hold off on the IS checklist. Although this went through QA, PFCU has not yet approved pilot site. It's now under review, but we pilot approval from client before we move forward with IS checklist and parallel test. Please hold off until that is done.

comment: Hi [~phoebe.george], any update?


author: JIRAUSER11104
comment: Hi [~phoebe.george]based on your comment: "PFCU has not yet approved pilot site.". Please turn over this story to the status "In Progress".




author: phoebe.george
comment: [~rony] Based on the pilot review, the tax forms are not appearing under the correct account type. I'm setting up a quick call with Diego, who is familiar with the PFCU setup so that we can discuss internally.

[~Ricky Lopez] FYI.

comment: [~rony] Here is the feedback from the pilot site review noted below.

Customer provided new test files, as they made some updates to the data on their end. Received 10/20/22:
|test/IRSTAP_5498.pgp|
|test/pfcu_tax_xref_20221019.txt.pgp|
|test/IRSTAP_1099R.pgp|

FEEDBACK below - [~rony] Can you check these two items and see if we need to make any modification on our end, or if the newer test files reflect the checked boxes and state noted below?
 * 5498 - Box 7 - IRA is not checked, but that box is checked on the forms we sent out last year. Quite possible that we were not supposed to check that box, but would like to have you review the code and IRSTap file to determine if that box should be checked. (one example is account/plan 1797)
 * 1099R - Box 15 does not include the two character state like we have done on the forms that we sent out last year. Please review and determine if that should be populated.



Also, can you confirm if there are any accounts that did not have a match in the xref file? Thanks!




author: rony
comment: Hi[~phoebe.george]

I will try to process it tomorrow.



about 5498 - box 7 - It depends on data file 547column in record B is 1 then this box will be checked.

about 1099R - this seems odd to me because by looking at the current code it doesn't seem like it ever displayed the 2-character state. Can we talk to [~terrencet]about it.





Thanks




author: rony
comment: Hi [~phoebe.george]

/d/ac-secure-share/imp/phoebe/1290 has updated sample with the new data and xref. I don't see any account missing.



Thanks




author: phoebe.george
comment: [~rony] PFCU has approved the latest samples for the 5498s and 1099-Rs.

For 5498's, they reviewed the box indicators and data is fine as is.

For 1099-R, no changes required to add in the 2-character state; samples approved as is.

Can you proceed with creating the index files for these two latest test files/xref to post to pilot?

Thanks!

comment: [~Ricky Lopez] There is a different Epic, but tied to same story on the PFCU EA Epic. Can you confirm who the previous developer was - we had posted eTaxes before for testing for this. Was it Eric in ISD? We need them to post this to pilot but take down the previous sets first:
