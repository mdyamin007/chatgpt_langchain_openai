I see it right there. Did you upload an updated file to qa folder? The one I see is dated 08/31 10:07.

You should see this this is correct

comment: The datafile in the project is for the bank we are not changing the logo for. To see the new logo you would need to change the datafile

comment: Is there a good reason why the correct datafile is not exported with the project?

[~jasonV], when you export the project to qa, you should expect that we see exactly what you exported and complain. We need a way to see what is going to production. If your export is not what will get to production, please, warn us before we waste time on discovering that, and provide us the way to see the real output--the correct datafile, I presume?

(I just hope the correct datafile is used in production...)

So, in order for me to close this issue, you must provide me the correct datafile or whatever needed to see the correct result. Thank you.

comment: Sorry for the outburst. Did not know the requirement, did not expect a conditional logo output, did not think to investigate. We're in a bit of a hurry and on the edge here :(

Works as expected. Issue closed.
