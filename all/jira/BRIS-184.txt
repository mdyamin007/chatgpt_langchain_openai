title: secure3: Temporary Windows File Server CIFS & RDP Port Access
description: [~kent.chan]: Per Hesham and Prem, they need your help to open up the firewall setting for the "temporary" windows secure3 ftp server:

10.4.10.17



We only need CIFS port opened for the following IS servers:

ca-isis-pr-01

ca-isis-pr-02

ca-isis-pr-03

ca-preproc-pr-02

ca-preproc-pr-03



We need RDP port opened on the IS Jumpstation so that we can RDP and configure the folder and add share permissions:

10.4.20.127

comment: [~davidt]: Please update the description above to confirm which servers need CIFs port opened.



[~hesham.hanna] and [~premraj.patil]: FYI. This is what we worked on last Thurs/Friday. Once Brisbane is up, i hope Kent can assist Prem to get this configured on the firewall so that we can continue start our Production Testing this week.

comment: [~hesham.hanna]: I did not read your spark message correctly and did not realize you needed the passwords for rh1login, script, and neil.



Can you ping me tomorrow morning and I will share the passwords? I have back-to-back meeting in the morning but should be able to multi-task.



Thanks!

comment: [~davidt]: Secure3 windows server is up and running. I just created the blank folders on this +temporary+secure ftp windows secure3 ftp server.



Can you setup your servers to mount to it in production brisbane.

comment: Hesham,

Can you open port 445 to ca-ftpbu-pr-01 (10.4.20.35). I can't connect or mount to this new secure3 server.



Thanks

comment: This should be fixed....all CIFS, SMB, NFS, RDP and SSH ports are open to the FTP servers.
