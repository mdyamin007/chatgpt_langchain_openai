env4 = 4406

 I tested with ver_pos='2.95' but the letter code will overlap with address line. And I have to change to 2.73. I suggest that if we can test it with print sample and the envelope first, then we can know whether this is working or not.

And there is no change to env4, so you have to see it on control file.


author: gthillaivel
comment: [~dawnl]--Can you request print samples to verify the address line in the letter


author: dawnl
comment: [~gthillaivel]- as mentioned, I already sent print sample request to OPS. you should received the email as well.

Here are the envelpes.

ENV1="4412"
ENV2="4412"
ENV3="4408"
ENV4="4406"

Do we need OPS to verify address position in envelope windows and envelope codes? Since the MTP is not required.
 If not, when is good to release this?

Thanks
