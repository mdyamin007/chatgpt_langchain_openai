title: 31255 - SSCU - Deleting incorrectly created accounts
description: Level 3

Accounts were created on 7/18 due to a visa statement posting incorrectly posted. The posting was removed, however the accounts remained in our database. Since some of the accounts were considered new, those show up in the accumulative optout report that we send daily to the client. Apparently they have some type of application that takes the enrollment file and maps certain accounts (not sure how this works on their end), but regardless having additional entries somehow messes with their system and causes delivery preferences to update for the wrong account. 

Accounts were also created on 7/29 due to ISD-6751. Client finally provided us an updated index file to post their new system letters, which contained around 250k accounts. Some of them happened to be new, so those defaulted to paper and added in the 7/30 accumulative optout report.
