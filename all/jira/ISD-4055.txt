comment: Deployed docdesc and notice app setup onto dev. Need details from IS on whether to enotice or doc processing, and also need confirmation from Keri about the notice descriptions as well as archival period.

comment: Received index file, setup doc processing on dev/pilot. Can view notices on both sso and admin site, need to still test emails and also confirm certain letter codes with IS/AC

author: shun.kuwashima

comment: Acct numbers for enotice 016 came masked in the data file, pending further action.


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: Still pending action about acct numbers coming in data file as masked, per Keri this will probably be pushed out further. TS 20667 will probably also be pushed out, since that project is adding additional notices.
