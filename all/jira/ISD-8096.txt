comment: [~dawnl] This feature is ready on pilot, please have the client review. There should now be a search type called Account Name on InfoTRAC account management.

comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid],

This project is adding Account Name to the search criteria on InfoTRAC Account Management. Below are steps:

1. Go to InfoTRAC Account Management tab on stage.
2. Change the Search Type from Account Number to Account Name.
3. Type in any name/string of letters. Lower/uppercase doesn't matter, it should not be case-sensitive.

If you don't see the Account Name search criteria at first, please clear cache and try again. Thanks!
