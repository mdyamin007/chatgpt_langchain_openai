I have the flag turned on and code is in parallel. Do you know if ISD+PC have their feature enabled?


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: Hi [~jun]- I'm not sure. I will check. Can you tell me, they should enable in parallel and production? Or just parallel?


author: jun
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]

Parallel for now so we can test.


author: jun
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com],

Please let me know when PC add piece code to their database and the weight for the insert.

comment: Hi [~jun]- what's the DT Job ID you want this added to?


author: jun
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com],

I don't have a dt job id. Please ask PC to provide one for #17.01. Thank you.

comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]

Can PC double check the piece code is correct in database and infotrac?

And can PC add the same configuration to Pilot environment and provide a DT_JOB_ID too?

Thank you!

comment: Hi [~jun]- Regarding -_Can PC double check the piece code is correct in database and infotrac?_ - what are you seeing that makes you think it's not correct?


author: jun
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com],

[~Shun.Kuwashima]can't post the index file. There is error saying "Can't replicate the pieceCode info in InfoTRAC!". The insert management tab doesn't show the new 33473 piece code.

Try this index file on Pilot,

author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] we're seeing the same error as before, the piece code doesn't seem to be on infotrac. There are only 2 forms activated under Insert Management and neither of them have piece code 33473. Can you take a look?


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima]- Please check form 4046. It has insert 33473.


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] the index file posted successfully on pilot after you activated the insert form. Please verify. Here's a few accts with the 'Late Charge' insert, statements are dated 5/18/2022:

author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] ISD portion is updated on stage. Please have the insert form ready with the correct piece code on infotrac stage, I'm assuming we will need a new index file from [~jun] in order for QA to test. We can pass it over to QA once all of that has been completed.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima]- What do you mean "infotrac stage"? I updated on pilot. I don't have access to "infotrac stage". Please advise.


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] you mentioned parallel ID, so I assumed we were testing this on stage. Is there a reason why we would skip stage? Also I see you have a login for infotrac stage, let me know if you need a password reset.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima]- Ah, I see. TBH, I just put that down always without really understanding what it meant.

So let me ask you, we tested on parallel and pilot. In order for QA to test, we must set up on stage correct? And I would then need to make the same updates to the insert management form as I did on pilot with insert 33473.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima]- I don't have the URL for InfoTrac Stage. Can you send with the login and then reset the PW? Thx


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] yes, usually QA tests on stage so you would need to setup the insert on infotrac stage similar to how you did on pilot. Then I believe Jun needs to make some update too or simply process a new index file on stage, would need to check with him on that. 

I will message your password over zoom. Here is the infotrac stage url: https://infotrac-stage.infoimageinc.com/login.do

[~jun]- Form 2441 created on stage with insert 33473. Per Shun -believe Jun needs to make some update too or simply process a new index file on stage, would need to check with him on that.



Please let me know if you need anything. Thanks

The log on PUI say something about "unable to extend table I3PROD_CU.ARCH_FILE by 8192 in tablespace I3DATA". Do you know what is this error?


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~jun] there was a lack of space in one of our tables, that issue is resolved.
[~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] I tried reposting, but I am seeing the same issue as before "Can't replicate the pieceCode info in InfoTRAC!". Can you double check that the insert is setup correctly on stage? Might be useful to compare between the setup on pilot vs stage.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima]- I'm not sure. I checked on stage and the insert is in the inventory and showing correctly on the Insert Management form. Could it be a setting with PC?


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] not sure, but one thing I noticed on the insert form on stage is that the 'Late Charge' insert is not clickable, unlike on pilot. Perhaps the actual insert file is not present somehow.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] [~jun]- Can you please try again with Insert form 1041? I was able to upload a PDF of the insert and it's now showing. Hopefully this will solve the issue.


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] that seemed to fix the issue, I was able to repost successfully. It should be viewable under account management after approving it on job status.

!SEFC Stage.PNG!


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] not all accounts in the index file have the selective insert, can you check the ones I previously commented for you check on pilot? I would assume the list of accounts used would be the same between pilot and stage.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima]- confirmed! Can we move forward with QA?


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] Yes
[~Igor.Khosid] [~berezinez] Selective inserts should be ready for review on stage. Please help test verify on InfoTRAC stage and SSO stage. Below are instructions:

InfoTRAC stage:
1. Go to account management and search up specific accounts with the piece code 33473. You can use these: 1705915809, 1705890530, 1705998540
2. Upon searching each account, go to the Real Estate Loans tab and there should be a statement with a clickable insert next to it called 'Late Charge'. Please open and verify.

SSO stage:
1. Go to the SSO test page for sefc stage and click the 'Alkami Primary Stage' tab.
2. Please fill in the following fields as needed, we need to use specific cifs to login for each account. Below are the cif/account pairs:
cif | account
419722 | 1705998540 
216952 | 1705890530
2661 | 1705915809

3. Based on which account you are testing above, please replace the CIF Number and MemberNumber(CIF) fields with the cif and BOTH AcctNumber fields with the account number. Everything else can remain the same.
4. You should be able to login and see a statement under the Mortgage Statements tab with the 'Late Charge' insert. Please open and verify.

Let me know if there are any questions.
