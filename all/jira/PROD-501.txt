|Hi Junho,

We only need these tables to be indexed. In fact, the other tables can be deleted since the clients have been discontinued.|



[... details about index creation ...]

For the read only user, I was thinking more 1 user per schema per environment.


So in total we would have 12 new users, one corresponding to each of the current logins that we have:
DEV
1. ora_admin_read
2. dev_bank_read
3. dev_cu_read
PILOT
4. pilot_read
5. pilot_bank_read
6. pilot_cu_read
STAGE
7. i3prod_read
8. i3prod_bank_read
9. i3prod_cu_read
PROD
10. i3_read
11. i3_bank_read
12. i3_cu_read

READ only technically doesn't really matter on the lower environment, but the idea is that I want everyone to get used to using READ only when querying the database; and only access with the login that has WRITE access when needed. I think this is safer overall and remove risks of accidental database changes. Though the chance of such a thing happening is low, removing the risk altogether is ideal.

Thanks,
Ta
