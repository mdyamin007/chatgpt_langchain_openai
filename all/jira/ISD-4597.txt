title: 20027 - RWCU - Member not receiving emails
description: For rwcu, delivery preference does not matter. We still send emails to members as long as an email was added via ECL file.

comment: Had internal call. Agreed that we process ECL files that are sent to us from IS, in the form of rwcu.email.csv instead of mmddyyyy_ECL_rwcu
