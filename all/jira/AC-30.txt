title: UCCU [19754] [pvt] UCCU - Daily Notice - Adverse Action and Credit Score Disclosure (Verbiage Update)
description: UCCU has attached the word documents of the changes.The change is highlighted in yellow on the letters.

They haveattached the test file with the Credit Report Name appended to the end of each record. 



UCCU wants the program to insert the Credit Report Contact Information into the Adverse Action Letters as follows:

Equifax - EQUIFAX, P.O. Box 740241, Atlanta, GA 30374-0241, 1-800-685-1111, www.equifax.com



TransUnion - TRANSUNION Consumer Relations, 2 Baldwin Place P.O. Box 1000, Chester, PA 19016, 1-800-888-4213, www.transunion.com/credit-reports-disclosures/free-credit-report



The Credit Score Disclosure letters just need to have the name of the credit report mapped, ie. "EQUIFAX" or "TRANSUNION"
 * 01 -Adverse Action (Denial) Equity
