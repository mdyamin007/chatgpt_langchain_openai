title: MFCU - [30302][pvt] Letter 145 Indirect Denial (AL-DL-06-10/19) New Cover Letter to be sent with recreated adverse actions letters that were missing key factors
description: *Update Description:*

One time update.
 Need to update letter 145, mfcu_DeclineLetter(AL-DL-06-10/19) with a cover letter.

After the update, we will package this file_mfcu_DeclineLetter_missing_key_factors_1_with a new segment (#5) and generate print and archival (No Estatement).

We will rollback the update after it's complete and need to hold other production runs if necessary in the mean time.

This will be a one-time update for a one-time mailing. It will only generate +*print*+ and +*archival*+. There will be no electronic posting. It will also take a total of 5 programming hours.

*Updated IS Assessment:*
 Hour : 5h
 Turnover : 8/1
 QA : 8/9
 Sample : 8/12
 Approval : 8/16
 Parallel : 8/17
 Live : 8/20

IS Developer: Anwar
 No ISD



For tickets #30302, #30642 and #30643:
 * Need to confirm the following with MFCU: Will the data file format be the same or different?
 ** If the same, no change needed can proceed with Anwar's assessment.
 ** If different, there are 2 options:
 *** Modify code for that data type

 * 
 ** 
 *** Completely have a new letter number for this format (not ideal)

 * Once confirmed, MFCU will need to send the data file to MATCH production:
 ** Combine ALL files into 1 zipfile and place in the FTP
 *** Outer File Name: *mfcu_dl_<mmddyyyy>_8.zip.pgp
 Letter 145: mfcu_DeclineLetter_mmddyyyy_seg#
 Letter 146: mfcu_CounterOfferLetter_mmddyyyy_seg#
 Letter 157: mfcu_CounterOfferLetter_mmddyyyy_seg#
 * This is for print AND archival (Note: these letters do not have eNotice)

comment: Hi [~anwarh], still pending approval. I followed up on the ticket.

Please note that we are still pending a production file from MFCU and that they are working on some logic updates on their end.

comment: Hi [~anwarh], please see following feedback from MFCU:

"The cover letter has one small correction that is needed which is a space between Fed and Credit under Sincerely.

Sample : Mission FedCredit Union

Should be : Mission Fed Credit Union"



Can you correct?

Thanks

comment: Hi [~dyuen], 

Are we waiting for samples? 
If yes, here is small one with the fix:  [^MFCUDL145_09022022.pdf] 
If not, let me know if this is approved or not and possibly create a parallel ticket. 

Thanks,
Anwar
