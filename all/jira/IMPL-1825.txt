title: PFCU - Set EMPCODE to 'U' for any records where there is no matching index information in the CIF
description: Update for Monthly Statements already done as of 10/29. Need to make update for Mortgage and HELOC.

From client:
We have found that for a given statement in the MRD009 file that does not have a matching record in the cif file, the archive index file contains an EMPCODE of a '0' for Mortgage and is blank/null for Account statements.  We would like the logic to be consistent across all applications.  If a statement in MRD009 does not have a matching record in the cif file (to provide the index information), then please set the EMPCODE to a 'U' for that record in the archive index file across all of our applications.

We will work with the current index files from July/August/September so there is no need to recreate them (unless for testing).
