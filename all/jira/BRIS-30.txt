description: Ernest to train will on how to install Papyrus DocExec & PrintPool version 7.4 from scratch

comment: As of 2 - 3 weeks ago. This priority has changed.  Since the primary focus is to go to a VM clone approach, the "Fresh Install" approach has been put to a very lower priority.  This means that I may be able to get trained fully to set this up all the way through. 

Bear in mind, I've gotten the training completed for setting up Image Converter;

I did get training for Papyrus DocExec & PrintPool, but I'm+not+ sure if the training is 100% accurate. So I'm still considering this task to not be fully completed.



Will move this task from "In Progress" to "To-Do" column
