comment: [~Ethan.Yu] - Can you provide me with a new timeline? It looks like this wasn't turned over to you. When this is ready in pilot, please provide some account numbers the client can check.

I'm still testing today, but let's set up a meeting with the client for some time tomorrow to go over pilot review.

I've tested and it looks like there may have been some miscommunication on the parameters in the URL.

I'll be reaching out to the client's developer to get on the same page on what the parameters are and what should be passed for each one.
