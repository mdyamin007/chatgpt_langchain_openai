Please fill out Master Parallel # 31759

Thanks, Barnett


author: andyp
comment: [~barnetts] [~berezinez]

Updated procedure in TS 31759.


author: barnetts
comment: HI [~andyp],

The Master parallel 31759 passed with notes. Pleaes release code.

1. Some of the boxes have a gray background (Total Now Due, Property Address and Important Information).  Enclosed sample does not have the gray background.  IS to verify.

2. Return Address does not align with with 2D.  Therefore during tap test, it will get slightly cut-off.

Thanks, Barnett 


author: andyp
comment: [~barnetts]
The gray bar/box did exist in several statements.  This was coming from Redtitan output.
I made some small adjustment for the address lines not to close to endorsement line.
