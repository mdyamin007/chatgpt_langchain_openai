title: UTCU - [29174][pvt] UTCU - New CD rate
description: We have 2 classifications of CDs with 13 line items each on them. The updated form that we sent on 5/13 has extra lines to accommodate for the new certificate (22 month) that we added in May. I pulled the maturity file that we sent over on 6/2 and have copied it here with the highlighted new CD. There are 13 lines per classification also in the maturity document.

comment: [~lemoy28]: Per our discussion, as long as we test print in parallel and eNotice looks ok, we do NOT need to run the full parallel run as mentioned in description section. This is an update type job, not adding or change the processing flow so parallel is not needed.
