I need help from Dp. Would it be possible to ask Dp to run tfcums1 in parallel with any production file for archival?



Thanks

I need help from Dp . I can't generate the issue . Would it be possible to run tfcums1_process.sh in parallel server with any production data ? We didn't change anything , so instruction is same.



I am running this parallel and I see messages.

Please provide me the data file that dp ran with.

I wonder if we didn't change anything, we are asking just to run in parallel. If a parallel run fails, not sure how it runs successfully in production.

Anyway please provide me the data file dp ran with.



Thanks

I need to talk with Peter first. I want to change a core file that normally we don't change to solve this issue. I will talk to Peter today after that I will provide it to qa.



Thanks

comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid]

The issue was archival pdfs were not getting message manager image. This is due to some internal settings from core scripts where the message manager images locations got changed but tfcu were using old configuration files where it doesn't search the images in updated location. I just updated so that tfcu will use new configuration file.

updated inf file path:

!image-2022-09-16-19-42-59-556.png|width=1339,height=235!

old ini file path:

!image-2022-09-16-19-45-45-475.png!



the screenshot is for tfcu_index.pl in /(d or z)/afp2web_iswk

as you see the only change is inIniFilePath . After the change I ran in parallel and both archival pdf from tfcums1 and tfcums2 have msg mgr messages.



[^business_06302022_774931_173.pdf][^business_06302022_774931_173.pdf]



The script is not in a conventional location so I couldn't check in. The script is: /z/afp2web_iswk/pfcu_index.pl



Thanks
