title: NECU - Paperless Flag Account Cleanup (Child of 21320)
description: We continue to try to clean up our paperless flags as we at Jovia view paperless to be a setting at the member, not account level. we continue to have many members with both paperless and paper accounts. case in point:

Account 465058048 in in your database twice. Once as CK, which is correct, and once as DD which is legacy from our old core. The CK is electronic, the DD is legacy from our old core is paper. The DD account does not appear in our CIF file and we cannot change it to electronic as an admin in infotrac.

As these DD accounts are no longer used, I believe the best solution would be to purge your database of all DD account types. Does that sound reasonable? What would be the process for doing that - I assume you can do a one time script to delete them? There should not be any statements associated to any DD account types as we reassociated those statements when we did our core conversion to the CK accounts in our new core. If they are they should be changed to the "CK" account type, but I am pretty sure none will have statements or any documents associated to them.

Thanks,
