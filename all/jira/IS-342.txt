title: EWBB - [21410][pvt] Update to FC DDA Statements
description: 1. CITY and STATE Fields Combined into Single ENTITYSTATE
- change variable to ent_city_state to use field 6
- change variable to customer_city_state to use field 18



2. Need to update program to check for uppercase "HEADER" to go to next account, because right now the program is looking for "Header" so all the accounts are considered as one account only for the test file.

comment: [~kdishroon] Sorry, I just got this on 8/24 instead of 8/17 as what's on the JIRA.

Do they have a new test file for this item on the ticket or do they want us to just use the test file they sent previously?

{color:#333333}2. STATEMENTENDDATE is formatted as mm-dd-YYYY instead of mm-dd-yyyy hh:mm:ss AM/PM{color}
- current date is actually mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss AM/PM, update to extract by "-" instead of "/"

{color:#0000ff}[EWB]: We can have this corrected to "/" instead of "-" please don't code for this.{color}



{color:#172b4d}If I use the test file they sent (EWBB_FCDDA_20210630.csv.pgp) then it will show the date as{color}

comment: Hi YaMee,

Can we use the file they provided?

Thank-you,

comment: As said the file they provided does not have the date they said they will update to so it will not show up correctly.

Here is the sample. Also, the data name is incorrect, it should be .txt instead of .csv, thought I can make that update for when we do parallel testing, the date will just have the same issue.

comment: Here is the client's response:

"Thank you for the update and output. We are working on revisions to the file for follow up testing. Our FX Vendor is in the process of getting those done this month. We'll revert back once we have a new file to submit."


author: kdishroon
comment: Per the client on 9/22:

"Our FX Vendor for our FCDDA Statements is currently wrapping up coding efforts in order for us to produce a new file. We are expecting this to occur by late next week or first week of October."

We will revisit the timeline when we receive the new test file.

"There have been some latest updates as of last Friday in regards to our project which has been placed on hold. For now, our management team has asked that we cancel this SOW and close this ticket."
