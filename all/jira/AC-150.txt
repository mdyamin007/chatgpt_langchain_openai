title: MPCU [15092] [pvt] Business Account mapping
description: 

Per Tai:



It will be 8 ISD hours for the one-time script to make the update.

This will cover development, research, support, and also the fact that this is a rush job (I only really have about one day before Wednesday to get everything done).



Script:

-Move statements from old SSO ID to new SSO ID.

-Script should also be able to do a dry-run to provide data for analysis.

~Won't update the mapping since this is only being used for statement processing, and have discussed that we will leave that update to the monthly file.
