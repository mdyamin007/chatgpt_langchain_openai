comment: [~mahbubS]-Please note, per William, we will need to enable AOLP via InfoTrac for the first cycle only so the bank can review an approve the first set of samples. Please let me know if you need anything. I'll let ISD know they need to turn on as well.

comment: Hi [~mousumiS]- Feedback from CU...



1. Can you produce a sample of the HOLD statements? They have Recycle Statements B-1Z. The CU want's these to be suppressed but included in PDF archival. I know we haven't started yet but can you confirm if this will be the case?Example: Michelle Garcia 8509-00861-4

2. Can you please put "Page 2" on the disclosure page?

3. Can you please place the name and address on subsequent pages like the Savings statements? See attached.

!WEST Name and Address on subsequent pages.PNG!


author: mahbubs
comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com],

1. I found only one account having the "Hold" verbiage in address.

!image-2022-06-21-19-39-27-966.png!

And what is "Statements B-1Z"? Did client provide a new data file?

2. If we print pagination in disclosure page, then the font doesn't matches. And the disclosure text starts from very top that the Page 2 verbiage position looks odd.

!image-2022-06-21-19-41-58-306.png!

Let me know if you are still ok with this.

Thanks


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: Hi [~mahbubS]-

1. OK thanks!

2. Let me get more info.

3. Yes, can you please create a sample with the different font and with the odd position.

author: mahbubs
comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com],

By seeing the scanned pdf it's hard to tell the precise font size and font type.

Would you please request to client what font size and type should we use for "If you have ... Please call" verbiage?

author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~mahbubS]-Unfortunately the bank does not have the font information. So please use the same font as STATEMENT DATE only in sentence case.

author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: Hi [~mousumiS]- OK, I just realized that the Savings statements have the same verbiage and look correct. I asked Anwar what font he is using. Please update the font for the"If you have ... Please call" and STATEMENT DATE verbiage to Frutinger (Font Code FT).

 # Update to top right font, left justify - See screenshot below
 # Recycle B1-Z Stmts (SOW updated. Must exclude from print and e. Include in PDF archival)
 # HOLD Stmts (SOW updated. Must exclude from print and e. Send to special file to print flat and mail directly to bank. Include in PDF archival)

author: mahbubs
comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com],

For HOLD, in SOW it doesn't say to exclude from print and estatement.

!image-2022-09-05-14-15-24-537.png!

Are you sure we have to suppress from print and estatement for HOLD?

Below is the specs of sf1 files.

Please advise.

author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: Hi [~mahbubS]- SOW has been updated to explicitly state to not print and mail or post to electronic. Instructions are for HOLD to print and return flat to the bank. Please keep in PDF archival. 5.sf1 is appropriate as we are returning them flat. Thanks.

Any feedback?

Thanks


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: Hi [~mahbubS]- Please see page 2873 on the latest sample PDF (also attached here). THere is a lot of white space on page 3. Is there any way you can clean up? THis is similar to the pagination issue we had with their Dealer Loan statements. I had asked Fahad and Prama to do the pagination manually. Can we do the same thing here?


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~mahbubS]- Here is the sample PDF.

[^WEST IRA Sample Feedback.pdf]


author: mahbubs
comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com],

The data file content pattern between West IRA and West Dealer Loan is very different. I have gone through the data file of West Dealer Loan.

InWest Dealer Loan there are major *two parts*: *Transactions* and *summary section* after the transaction. So it is easier to extract those sections in that app.

But for West IRA, there is no clue to determine different sections. Several type of transactions and summary types of data appears anywhere in the data for West IRA.

What I can do, I can check if a page has some remaining space. If there are contents to print on the next page and those content can fit in that "remaining space" then I can print those "next page" contents to the "previous page" remaining space.

Would that be ok?

Or does client just want to merge all page data and print as is?

Let me know if anything is confusing.

Thanks


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: Hi [~mahbubS]- Yes, that will work. The bank just wants us to eliminate as much white space as possible to avoid paper waste. Thanks!

comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com],

I can see archival related specifications in SOW.

And the timeline in smartsheet says 10/03 is the archival sample date.

!image-2022-09-16-12-41-26-016.png!

Is this the confirmed archival sample date?

And what should we put in the below fields (col:61, Length:10 and col:71, Length:40)?

I hope the Name field would be the 1st address line.

Should we just print "IRA" in fieldcol:61, Length:10. If so then would it be left or right justified?

author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: Hi [~mousumiS] [~mahbubS]- Sample looks ok so far but I'm still seeing some extra white space. Please see page 2296 of the PDF sample. It looks like these statements are page 3 but the data still does not go all the way down to the bottom. Can you fix?

Sorry to be a pain about this but the bank is concerned about paper waste.



Thanks


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: Hi [~mahbubS]- Yes, I have down 10/3 as the PDF archival sample date.

Regarding your questions, I'll defer to [~diegof].


author: diegof
comment: [~mahbubS] everything should be right justified. and yes just print IRA and yes name is just 1st address line.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: Hi [~mahbubS]- Please also generate a sample of the special file with the HOLD statements for the bank to review.


author: mahbubs
comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com],

I checked the customer statement in page 2296 of the sample. That customer statement has remaining space about 2.7 inches to print. See below snap:

!image-2022-09-19-12-18-00-214.png!



On the next page the content has at least about 3.33 inches data to print. So even if I try to fill-up the empty spaces in previous page, some lines would definitely get printed in next page because there is not enough space in the 1st page.

author: mahbubs
comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com],

Some account has "STATEMENTS" and some has "STATEMENT".

!image-2022-09-19-13-39-24-726.png!

!image-2022-09-19-13-38-14-456.png!

And some has "B1P" in place of "B-1Z".

!image-2022-09-19-13-40-27-807.png!

And some B1P has the "S" in the "STATEMENT":

!image-2022-09-19-13-41-00-903.png!

And interesting part is some account has "B1-Z" instead "B-1Z":

!image-2022-09-19-14-11-27-128.png! 



Should we redirect all these to "nop" (paper suppress) and suppress from estatement?

And should we just look for "RECYCLE STATEMENT" in address line for these cases?

Please advise.

Thanks

author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: Hi [~mahbubS]- Regarding your response on the spacing issue on page 2296 of the sample, is there a way you can extend the values on page 2296 further down the page? The bank is concerned with paper usage. I understand that it won't prevent the next page from printing but the bank would like to see the max amount of space be used on each sheet of paper.



I will ask about the Recycle statements and get back to you and review the SF1 file with them.

Thanks


author: mahbubs
comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com],

To display the lines further down the page, we have to merge all page data and print as is.

Currently There is no clue to capture each sections. We can look for verbiages but that is risky because in future data file may not have those verbiages.

Lets provide a sample by merging all pages and displaying as is. If client is not ok with it then we may need to check for some messy conditions to capture each sections and display one after another.

If client agree with it then let me know then i will proceed accordingly.

Thanks


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: Hi [~mahbubS]- I agree. Please provide a sample with all page data merged and printed as is.

author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: Hi [~mousumiS]- 2 things...

1. Sample looks good. However, I noticed the logo is in color and it's missing the endorsement lines. Can you please make logo b/w and add the endorsement lines for final approval?

2. The HOLD statement sample is incorrect. If you look at the samplewestir11205.sf1 - it contains the accounts for "Recycle B1-Z". This is incorrect. These statements are not returned flat to the bank. Only the HOLD statements. These HOLD statements are -Diversion code is in positions 23-25 (3 characters). Its either spaces for regular print or HLD for hold mail. Also records with 100 in positions 23-25 can be skipped. Please update and provide new sample.

3. I've also updated the SOW with the variable verbiage that can be found with the "Recycle B-1Z" suppressions.There are variations of the "B-1Z" that will need to be accounted for (based on what you found 2 days ago).


author: mahbubs
comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com],

About point 2:

The sf1 sample got those B1-Z accounts because of the variation of the verbiages (missing 'S' and B-1Z, B1-Z, B1P confusion) that i mentioned 2 days ago. Those account also had the HLD flag. As the B-1Z related condition didn't fulfill, they got entry in sf1 file because they have HLD as well.

I saw you updated the SOW. We will provide a sample after updating accordingly.

Thanks


author: mahbubs
comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com],

I have found more B1-Z scenario:

RECYCLED:

!image-2022-09-22-11-57-42-751.png!



B-1P (who knows, there could be B1-P), RECYCLE STMT :

!image-2022-09-22-11-58-35-324.png!

Please add these in SOW as well.

Thanks


author: mahbubs
comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com],

There is a spelling mistake of "RECYCLE" in below customer. Due to this the customer is redirected to sf1 because it has HLD flag as well.

!image-2022-09-22-12-09-49-107.png!

Please let client know about all these issue and if possible request a latest data from them.

comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com],

In latest SOW I am seeing there is no segment in data file naming convention? Why they are being inconsistent in data file naming convention? It increases back and forth at the crucial time.

In previous SOW there was segment in data file name and they are using "TXT" which was earlier "txt". Please aware them not to frequently change the naming convention.

Also updated SOW says the data file will not be zipped.

Please confirm the updated naming convention of data file. At least the data file should have a segment number. otherwise if client sends multiple data file in same day then there will be issues.


And the latest production data are very small.
Cycle WEST_IRA_20092022.TXT.pgp has only 2 customers.
This data don't has sf1 (HLD) scenario.

I attached the sample that was generated usingWEST_IRA_20092022.TXT.pgp[^westir11204.2o1_cycle0920.pdf]

Thanks


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: Hi [~mahbubS]- SOW has been updated with the correct naming convention. Sorry for the confusion.

Also...

1. Please go with the WAB page breaks. Bank changed their mind about wanting to update to eliminate whitespace.

2. Please make page 2 header ("Retirement Account Statement") line up with page 1. Right now it's printing higher on page 2. I believe this is because we have to shift down on page 1 to fit the window envelope. Bank wants both headers to line up.

comment: Hi [~mahbubS]- I'm looking at thewestir11305.sf1.pdf file and have a question:

The first account is a recycle statement. I thought this was being suppressed altogether but included in PDF archival. It should not be included in the SF1 file.



Also, 1 more question regarding the samples fromwestir11214.2o1.pdf. Please see last page (page 3178). The bank states it's not using the WAB page break. They said it should have gone to a page 3179. All the others looked good so that's why they were confused.




author: mahbubs
comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com],

The first account of sf1 file has "REYCLE" instead of "RECYCLE" in data file. This customer has HLD as well in data.

Tell client to correct their data file.Then it will be redirect to nop (B-1Z).

!image-2022-09-29-14-58-31-056.png!

author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: Hi [~mahbubS]- The bank has some questions regarding the HOLD file sent (westir11305.sf1.pdf).

1. Is this a complete file for the entire 6/30 cycle? Bank says there should be at least 150 HOLD statements.

2. Why is the account on page 5 (Vaune Newvine) included? Bank states it is not a HOLD account.


author: mahbubs
comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com],

Ans 1: In cycle 0630 there are 168 accounts that has HLD flag. Among them 165 accounts has B-1Z type of verbiages. According to SOW B-1Z types has the 1st precedence over HLD. That's why only 3 of the HLD are getting entry in sf1 file and rest of the HLD accounts are diverted to nop (nonprint) because of the B-1Z type of verbiages.

And yes, I ran the entire 0630 cycle.



Ans 2: the customer VAUNE A NEWVINE has HLD flag in 0630 cycle data.

comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com], use the no encrypted file: Westamerica-Bank-IRA-Statements-06302022.zip, we provided both. 
Thanks


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~anwarh]- the file needs to be PGP encrypted. I'm not seeing that file in your folder/d/ac-secure-share/dsi_print/anwarH/west_ira_is_873.

Peter installed the PGP key earlier. Do you have?


author: anwarh
comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com], 

Encryption is done in one way, meaning "We" as InfoImage can't decrypt file once we encrypt a file using Bank's key. 
So if you want to see the content use the non-encrypted file: /d/ac-secure-share/dsi_print/anwarH/west_ira_is_873/Westamerica-Bank-IRA-Statements-06302022.zip
If you want to send it to the client, use: /d/ac-secure-share/dsi_print/anwarH/west_ira_is_873/Westamerica-Bank-IRA-Statements-06302022.zip.pgp

Is that answer you questions?

It should be one of them

I think the '.pgp' is not showing up on your PC, 
 do the following, you will see the '.pgp'

Let me know if you need a call for this.

Thanks

comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com],

I got your msg from zoom about the "print status" related archival updated.

However I am too much busy on two other projects.

Can I provide the sample on Monday? Or if by any chance I can manage to finish other urgent works, then I will provide you sample before Monday.

Thanks


author: mahbubs
comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com],

If the update is only related to "Print status" then, the updates are done.

I ran the process today using latest resources.

Archival sample is at:/d/ac-secure-share/dsi_print/mahbubS/Westamerica-Bank-IRA-Statements-06302022.zip

The index file is inside the zip file.

Thanks


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~mahbubS]- Looks good! I just need a PDF archival file that is encrypted. Please provide and I will send to the bank for final approval.

comment: Hi Stephen,

I placed the pgp sample in/d/ac-secure-share/dsi_print/mahbubS/Westamerica-Bank-IRA-Statements-06302022.zip.pgp

Thanks

comment: Hi [~mahbubS]- Please see attached. This is the SF1 file. The data has an @ symbol but it's outputting a weird symbol. This needs to be corrected. Can you please update? Please provide a new SF1 file and a dpvs so we can print hardcopies for the bank to sign off on.
