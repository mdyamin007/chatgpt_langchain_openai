comment: Hi[~enricob],

Sample 2 are attached here.

Some samples do not have the signatures as they are still not provided.

For letter 110 the letter type is 1 but datafile do not have this letter type so we generated it from data of letter 109 assuming it as letter type 1.

comment: [~rumanb]/[~sadiqs]/[~Najoa]/[~PramaG]/[~rony]/[~anwarh] : Just curious. Is the samples you provided above using the latest black and white logo that was attached to this Jira ticket from yesterday? Please advise.

Batch 1 sample 3 is attached here.

[^Sample 3.zip]

For letter 067, branchNum=20 is present in the data file but not in the branch list. That's why the signature is missing in the pdf *MFCUDL067*

Thanks,

comment: Hi[~William.Kong]/[~enricob]:

The b/w tiff logo that we have seems a little rugged compared to the colored ones.

!image-2021-10-28-00-36-14-732.png|width=1086,height=136!

Maybe that's why it's causing the issue you mentioned. Can we have a new b/w logo with similar smoothness?


author: anwarh
comment: Hi [~enricob],
I created this b/w logo from the color one. Can you please print this and check?[^MFCUDL078.DAT.pdf]

comment: Client report bug that the NSF noticed totals 129 & 131 letter codes did not balance.

Anwar adjusted the logic. We will release the code and have customer audit the results in production.


author: enricob
comment: Need logic update on letter 016. Payment date currently is not incrementing between each loan coupons.



Logic:

The payment due month needs to increment starting from the 2nd loan coupon
so if payment due for the first one is 10/12/2021, then for the 2nd one is supposed to be 11/12/2021.

IF the month is 12 then then next one should reset to 1 and the year should increment by 1.
