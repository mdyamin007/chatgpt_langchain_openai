title: 11712 - GLOBAL - Tax correction updates
description: We need to enhance the eTax process to flag statements that are replacement as replacement. So new column in database. Then for clients who want to use it, we read that column to display a value to say that the tax form is a correction.Hypercube need to be able to read this value from API.The same is true for InfoTRAC.API needs to be enhanced to pass over this value in the call.I think we only need to do PUI/Prism/Hypercube, and Anil and Surekha will take care of InfoTRAC and API.
