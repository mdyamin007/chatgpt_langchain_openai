title: NTSB - Console Log Error Removal
description: None

comment: To SSO, please use this query:

select * from usr_session where org_id = getorgid('ntsb');

The sess_login_id column is what we put into the sess_login_id rows. The key is the key returned from the first connectionString.jsp request.

comment: 1. Console Error for new user on 'Click' on 'Agree' button

'POST https://ntsbstage.infoimageinc.com:9680/enroll/ssoOptoutAll.jsp 500 (Internal Server Error'

2, In process of enrollment after accepting Agreement on Profile page the radio buttons for Selecting Paperless/Paper options are grey out and not selectable

comment: For (2), the email addresses are obtained via Auth file. Therefore, if there are no accounts with email addresses, the user will not be able to enroll. This is working as intended.



This is a user that has at least one email for an account:

0849a1deb1d336268101e29ca0390986

comment: I verified 2 previously submitted issues and they are fixed.

With sess_login_id = 0849a1deb1d336268101e29ca0390986 I can't complete whole enrollment, can't enter email address:

comment: Yes, I have confirmed that it is not an issue. The auth file is the only source that can provide an email address.
