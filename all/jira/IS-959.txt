comment: [~mousumiS] [~tanmay] Here is the feedback from the customer from the first round of samples:

Can we add $ in front of the principal balance? !image.png!

Can we add first name tag after THANK YOU, <First Name> !image.png!

If the <First Name> is blank would that in turn just show blank or would that cause a issue? Just want to confirm cause we do have some commercial account types that the name is only in the last name field and want to confirm for those they would have an empty first name tag would it just be blank? Which would be fine just want to make sure I understand if we can add that what happens when the data is blank.

[~ratnam] FYI
