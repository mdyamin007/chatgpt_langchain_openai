title: Create Small Temp Ubutunu VM on 10.5.20.### network to troubleshoot NFS
description: Setup a small Ubuntu VM in the 10.5.20.### network so that we can trouble NFS access between different VLAN



Ubuntu VM 18.04

1 cpu, 512mb ram and 1GB Storage is all you get

You can label it ca-temp-willk-01 for now and please temporarily add to DNS server as well.





Please ensure port 2048 and port 111 is open between the following servers:

ca-isis-pr-01

ca-isis-pr-02

ca-isis-pr-03

ca-preproc-pr-02

ca-preproc-pr-03

comment: [~kent.chan]:  Good news!  I'm able to mount between rh2 and ca-rhstore-dv-01.  Need to test the other servers just to make sure all servers can NFS mount cross 10.4.20.### to 10.5.20.###
