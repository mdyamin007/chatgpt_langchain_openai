comment: [~Tin.Chak] From our resource call yesterday, can you assign this story for setting up eAOLP for SUCU's monthly statements? Thanks!


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~eric.yan] can you confirm if you are able to setup/enable? I would like to pilot with customer for both IS and ISD simultaneously. Thank you!

[~Juliana Vannik] [~rony] FYI

I've enabled the AOLP flag for statements in pilot, the client should be able to test the function now.

comment: stage, pilot updated.

comment: [~eric.yan] Thank you! We will be going live with this after EOM. I'm pending confirmation from client and we will update the ticket due date once confirmed. But it will not require release for this EOM.

comment: [~eric.yan] I checked InfoTrac pilot site, and the AOLP for eStatement is not showing up. Does this need to be reprocessed by [~rony] in order for it to appear? Thanks!

Did the reprocess resolve the issue? When should I release update in prod?


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~eric.yan] QA just finished, and we are going to run the parallel test today. Once done/passed, we can move forward with code release. Please update the new live date to 6/24/22.

[~Juliana Vannik]Please update the live date on the Epic as well to 6/24/22. Thanks!
