title: GCBK - [30969][pvt] Dodd-Frank Statements Interest Paid YTD missing 1000th digit
description: There's been a slight change in the data under the Past Payment Breakdown section which is causing this. There are some verbiage changes and the amount seems to have been moved more to the left and it's messing up the mapping. Amounts under Principal and Interest are being affected. Currently, the code picks up Principal from position 18, length 13 and Interest from position 32, length 12 and with the data change, we'll need to update the code to pick up Principal from position 12 and Interest from position 26.
