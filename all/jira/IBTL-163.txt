comment: [~William.Kong] this is a menlo job, can we consider it as pass?


author: william.kong
comment: [~jasramos]: Can you go ahead and more this pass w/ notes? Please assign this ticket back to me as I want the team to review why we still have this error message; Most likely we don't need to re-run.

comment: [~jasramos] [~William.Kong] - Also please note that the afp files did not get copied to /d/isd_share/ewbb/afpfiles hence InfoTrac is unable to open pdf via JobStaus.

comment: [~Peter.Dang]: This is another same issue as:

[~shailendrar]: Can you re-create the divert report one last time? We had to re-run the job again? OPS will print this Friday since they could not do it last week:
