title: UFCU - Monthly Statement - Update LOC Interest Rate
description: IS Assessment:

Fix logic decimal point logic:  Record Mapping is correct:  Record 4050 Column 39 (6 bytes). 

Current, logic issue is 9999V99  

The decimal point should be positioned where the letter 'V' is:  999V999 (i.e. insert December between column 41 & 42 of Record 4050).
