title: Email Notification Stagger
description: Update Notify Service to have the option to stagger email/SMS notification.
During the job creation, 2 optional parameters will be provided which will be called batchSize (default - 10000), batchInterval (default - 60 mins).
The job will not send any notification after each batch process the notification will be sent after the job completion.
The main job will not be divided into multiple parts. Rather than dividing it, the job will be processed till the batchSize and again it will be pushed to MQ again with batchInterval as the next scheduled time. When the job will come from MQ again the process will start from where it has left off.
