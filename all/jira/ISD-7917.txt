comment: [~barnetts] I was out of office since 10/7, so didn't see this until today. I rolled out the update to pilot and tested, the heloc and credit card email templates should no longer show an approval status and admins should be able to save the content without error. Please have the client review on the pilot admin site.

Per SSCU, 
We were able to successfully test in the pilot site and confirmed that they do not show that they are in the approved status. 

Thanks, Barnett

comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid],

This is removing the email approval feature for the Home Equity and Credit Card email template on the admin site, which should allow admins to save the templates regardless of approval status. Testing is as follows:

1. Login to Stage admin site
2. Select the Email Proofing tab and select the Home Equity template
3. Edit the email content and click Save. It should let you save and continue without error.
4. Perform the above steps for Credit Card template.

Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks
