Can you help me post the attached index file[^ea1_20211116_1_20211117_1627_idcu.txt]to pilot?

Thanks!

comment: [~SamV2021] It's posted, all of the statements posted to acct 0.

Thanks! I believe in the provided data file, none of the account numbers matched what was in the cross reference, so that's why it's all 0. We'll inform the client when we provide them the samples.

I cannot verify posting on stage, all accounts in Index file[^ea1_20211116_1_20211117_1627_idcu.txt]shows as zero. Please provide another Index file.



[~Kbittmann]

please request print samples.

All account numbers show up as zero because all accounts in the data file do not have a match in the cross reference file. This is the most recent data file provided by the client that they wanted us to test with, so I think we can overlook the accounts being 0 since the index file itself looks correct, is posted, and links to an afp.

Let me know if you still want a new index file -- I'll reprocess with a different data file.
