In ms1 app the right margin is 0.5 inch. We used right margin 0.35 inch in ms3 app. Due to this, the blue top right box and gradient is not getting aligned because for previous app that overlay was created by considering right margin 0.5 inch.

!image-2022-09-15-18-03-59-492.png!

If we keep the right margin 0.5 inch as well, then the probability of overlapping product header(acct num - prod desc) with "ANNUAL PERCENTAGE ..." line will increase.

Please advise what approach should we follow?

Thanks

comment: Hi [~mahbubS] [~Najoa]please review below feedback from CU.



*Monthly Deposit Statements*  minor adjustment. The font for the minor name, in the example below 12Month Certificate is too large. Make the same as Annual Percentage. Also below the Minor name, put a little more space before the next line. In the example below more space between 12Month Certificate and Maturity Date. This seems to be an issue with Certificates only.

comment: [~mahbubS] SNCU just let me know that the new core will produce 2 statement files only on quarter ends (Dec, Mar, Jun Sep).  All other months will produce 1 statement file.

comment: Hi [~kericapote],

If client sends two data file in the same day, then they must use the segment number in the data file name. Currently I can see the segment number in data file naming convention in SOW.

There could be two cases.
 # If DP will kick off the process manually, then they just need to run the two data file one after another.
 # If there is a cron to execute the process, then we need to handle it in processing script program to execute multiple segment data.

Please let me know which one to follow.

Thanks

Guys, I can see in the samples that we output the logo and the header in the second page even if it is empty. Is this intentional? Because it looks rather unnecessary:

comment: Hi [~avannik] [~diegof] [~kericapote],

Would you please check the existing setup of SNCUMS1 that how the paper sample looks?

I reckon existing ms1 app uses a preprint that has logo, blue top right box, gradient, stock code in both sides(front and back) of the page.

I need to check if a customer statement has only 1 page, then do the statement displays the logo, blue top right box, gradient, stock code on the back side of the page.

Logically it should print the logo and etc. in the both sides in the existing app.

Thanks

I didn't get any feedback on a comment regarding an empty page issue that I made on 5 days ago. I am rephrasing it below:

comment: [~avannik] [~kericapote] can we request a test print of the current production file? [^sncums1.print]

^This is the latest dpvs. We can just print 1-10 of the 2o1 file. This should be 1 pagers. [~mahbubS] wants to know if the back of those 1 pagers^

^Can we try and get this done today? If it shows with that blank page similar to this.^

Can you confirm which MM should display?

comment: the one on the print/pdf samples will be depending on the campaign setup on staging. The one on the right is local on papyrus so that will be different.

I dont have access to staging infotrac to verify.

comment: [~mahbubS] [~gthillaivel] [~kericapote] based on that last sample the current program also produces that header even if there is no data so i think Sakib your assumption is correct. Can we proceed Gnana?

comment: Hi [~diegof] [~kericapote],

*About multiple data in quarterly months*: As the data file is OSI DNA we can merge the multiple data file into one data file and process at once. In this case we need the proper naming convention of the multiple data files.

Please update the SOW accordingly.

Thanks


author: diegof
comment: i am not under the impression that we would need mutiple data files for quarterly. [~kericapote] is this something that came from the client. If that is the case we need to make an update post launch. [~gthillaivel] [~mahbubS]... is there anything keeping this from parallel at this point? We need to submit this today.


author: kericapote
comment: [~diegof] [~mahbubS] Per email on 10/4 Kathy says:
This past Friday was our first time in DNA that we could run EOM and EOQ statements.  Unlike DataSafe, to accomplish this in DNA, the statement job is run twice, once for EOM and again for EOQ which means it produces 2 statement files vs. 1 which weve been testing.

This means monthly well send 1 statement file and quarterly well be sending 2 statement files.  My question is how do you want me to name and upload them?

author: diegof
comment: [~kericapote] they can just send the second file as a segment 2. This way we dont need to code for more files.


author: diegof
comment: [~gthillaivel] if there is no other issues please continue with parallel.


author: mahbubs
comment: Hi [~diegof] [~kericapote],

Can we do the code update for multiple segment data file processing after the code goes to live? Like a phase 2 update?

I don't want to make any rush update at the month end. Also we have time because next quarter is December.

Please suggest.

Thanks
