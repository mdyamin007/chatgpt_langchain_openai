title: IDCU - [24146][pvt] Update XML tags used for name/address on DF mortgage statement
description: IS and ISD Assessment
 =============
 Hours for development: 2 IS hours + 1 ISD hours required
 Turnover Date :12/17/2022
 Sample to QA Date: 02/02/2022
 Sample Approval Date: 02/09/2022
 Go live date : 02/18/2022



Assessment Details (IS):
 - Parallel required: (no)

 - update parsing script,idcuml1_xmlParser.py to extract from new address tag.

 - update the formatting program IDCUML11.dfa

 - DF Mortgage (idcuml1) -> idcuml1_process.sh
 - The XML data file used to generate our loan bills (DF mortgage, commercial, consumer) has been updated to include tags for the co-borrower's name. We need to have the Name/Address section of the DF mortgage statement updated to read the new tag set.



Attached is a mock-up of the Name/Address section that identifies the new XML tags where it needs to be mapped. I have also dropped the following TEST file to the TEST folder on the FTP:LN_BLXTR_111521.7z.gpg.. (i.e. /d/ftpbu/idcu-testbu/ folder)



*Updated 1/10/2022:*

Please refer to to attachments MTG_Stmts(1).docx that was pulled from comment #10 TS# 24146; Apparently, these were not attached when Jira ticket was created.

IDCU have also dropped the following TEST file to the TEST folder on the FTP:LN_BLXTR_111521.7z.gpg back in 11/15/2021.
