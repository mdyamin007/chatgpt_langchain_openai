i renamed the file to remove the spaces.

^please note this file is huge. I think [~Peter.Dang] was going to look at creating one from the word doc.^

^I actually cannot attach the file to the ticket. its like 20+ mb. I moved the file to your /d/iss/ folder [~jasonV]^

author: andreav
comment: Jason, please see request from client below and see if the message and inline insert quality can be improved. Maybe we should use the huge TIFF the client provided?

_One issue we are seeing is the in-the-box statement message and the in-line insert for the annual billing rights disclosure is pixilated.  The quality of these two things is not as good as the rest of the statement._
