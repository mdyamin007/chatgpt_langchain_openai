Eric, the accounts appearing in staging look good. Please proceed with the next steps for the release to be updated so DP can reprocess in production. IS-719 Story created (tied to same eTax Epic so that I can bill altogether).

1042s has no match in the tax xref file. Should 1042s just post using the original account numbers?

comment: Hi [~phoebe.george]

The same logic is applied to all 1099 forms now, and 1042s has been excluded from the xref matching logic. Please have DP to reprocess and provide samples in production.

comment: [~phoebe.george]: Can you advise status on this project? My understanding Eric stated code is released. Did DP process their production files into eStatement system even though they are not live yet.
