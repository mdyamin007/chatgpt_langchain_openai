title: 2992, 2297 - SEFC, SHEL - not able to load documents
description: Hoping it's a matter of p3p policy.

SEFC bottomline users are having troubles, which is a different site URI from the current p3p which uses the DI site as the primary uri.

SHEL had some p3p files but with wfcu information. updated and uncommented out header. going to deploy and ask to check again. if that works I'll try to deploy a double policy for SEFC.
