comment: From [~ratnam]:

CU confirmed the Loan Number on the statement is not the Member Number and cannot be used for indexing. They are working with FICS to add additional field below Loan Number. CU will send us another set of sample with the additional field.





Also, CU wants to add logo in below section. I have provided EDCU statement Screen shot below including logo. Please review and confirm if this can be implemented.

comment: Hi Eric, please review attached Mortgage FICS PDF sample. CU included Member Number field that will be used to indexing eStatement.



I only see one account included in the PDF. I requested CU to provide one single PDF with multiple accounts and also include few delinquency accounts.



Thanks

I've the data file with multiple accounts. I'm waiting for the logo file to provide first draft of sample, or should I provide sample without the logo first?

comment: Hi Eric, please review attached .csv reconcile file. Client provided associated provided FICS PDF samples as well but there is issue with blank address over the top of the statement on most of the accounts. I requested CU to send corrected samples.

Meanwhile, please confirm if the .CSV file format works for you?



Thanks
