Hi Joye,

I will miss today's pilot date, and will have this ready for you tomorrow. I've been pretty busy and am available to work on it now.

Hi Joye,

Can we combine the reports into one? Also, do we need the Account Holder Name in the report?

Hi Joye,

Any update on this?

Please see client's response below.

They will need to be two separate reports still. As long as Account Holder's name is added as the last column I do not have an issue with adding it.

Thank you,

John Pollock

The reports generated are from pilot. It is dropped off in the client_pickup folder. I have attached them here as well if the client couldn't receive it. Please have the client confirm they were able to pick up the report from the client_pickup folder and validate the report, the data in the report is from pilot so it may not be fully in sync with what is on prod.

 # Generate the two reports (Email Address Collection Report,Accumulative Paperless Report)
 # Check theAccumulative Paperless Report file that was generated
 ## If the account is on Electronic, it should say Paperless Only
 ## If the account is on Paper, it should sayPaper and Paperless

Hi Joye,
 # What is the frequency in which the reports are generated and dropped off?
 # Does the client want the reports encrypted?
 # Do they want a confirmation email sent to them when the report is generated and dropped off?

Please see client answers below.

1. Daily if possible
2. No encryption needed, but we may want to change this later
3. An email to IT-Data-Operations at IT-Data-Operations@midlandsb.com would be great.

Client would like code released tomorrow.
