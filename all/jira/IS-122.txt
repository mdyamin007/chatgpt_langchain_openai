Please provide new envelope code tochange from house #10 to the customer envelope


author: william.kong
comment: [~kericapote]: Please advise ETA on getting the new envelope code.


author: william.kong
comment: [~kericapote]: We have not received any updates on the envelope code. The target live date of 7/15 may be missed if we do not received the envelope code by *end of day today*. Thomas needs to update the control file with this new envelope code and we need to run this through parallel so that OPS can confirm that they can read the envelope code in the inserter equipment.

comment: [~William.Kong]The envelope art was approved last week and I am waiting on Gabe to tell me when they will be in stock to get a new live date. I told Jun the envelope piece code as he is working on this. No one else has asked for it that I am aware of.

comment: [~William.Kong]also the SOWs are up to date so he could have looked there.




author: william.kong
comment: [~kericapote]: Which version of the SOWs? There are 3. Why aren't we just using one SOW? Can you discuss this with Steve & Daphne to get this consolidated into one SOW. Sharepoint has version control so we can overwrite and keep track of the versioning.

comment: [~kericapote]: This one as well. I believe your email yesterday stated that material will arrive late. If so, please advise a new live date so that we can plan accordingly. Thanks!

comment: Hi [~kericapote],



I understand you just returned today. Are we still expecting to still go live by Sept 20, 2021. I just want to make sure client is still expecting to go live by 9/20 since this project has delayed multiple time. 

[~phoebe.george]: FYI.



Please advise.


author: kericapote
comment: [~William.Kong]The customer has not delayed this. ISD was trying to release other things at the same time so the delay was ours. I checked with Gabe and envelopes are still due 9/20 so we will need to go live by then.

Thx!


author: william.kong
comment: [~kericapote]: Thanks for the update!



[~thomasY]: Please also add this to your release list for Monday. [~TunA]is OOO on Monday, so please work with [~Peter.Dang]/[~yameelee]for the code release.




author: william.kong
comment: [~thomasY]: As discussed, please rollback the code. The revised due date of 9/30 was not updated as requested on Monday from Keri. I will change the status and update the due date to 9/30/2021


author: kericapote
comment: [~thomasY] has code been released for this per the new due date 9/30?
