title: Bank logo & return address do not fit in the envelope window
description: I made a preliminary tap-test, that is, what's going to be visible in the envelope's window  normally we test positions when a folded first page inside is at the bottom and to the extreme left and/or right. These are not print samples yet, but I can estimate already that part of the logo and the return address will not be visible (see the attachments).
