title: Missing info in the DOC_DESC table.
description: The DOC_DESC table does not have the descriptions for documents with TYPE_CODE 215, 216

look here:
{code:sh}[oper1@rhs ~]$ cat /home/test/procs/bkpllna.procs | grep -En '215|216'
37:LN1880P                         Initial ARM Interest Rate Notice (LN1880P)          215
