title: Delivery Preference Issue on STAGE
description: Cannot have both accounts 39576 and 88776 on electronics and set email address.

If switch one of them to paper, and then back to electronic + email address, the other account would remain on electronic but loses its email address.  On DB end, it was losing its NOTIFICATION_PREFERENCE record.
