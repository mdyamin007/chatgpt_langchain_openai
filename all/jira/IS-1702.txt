Didn't notice before but for visa account, no is already masked in the data file. Do we need to do anything here.

!image-2022-10-13-21-36-27-442.png!



And do we need to unmask member no also, 445-21 in the snapshot?

Or the update is just to unmask for monthly we will not touch the visa that get combined with monthly.

Thanks

Let me double check with client. Thanks.

Per Keri, please unmask only monthly stmt. This is the last file from the old core. New stmt is not combined and does no have visa at all.

Thanks.

comment: Hi [~rony],

Can you provide sample to have the accounts showing on SNCU new statements from DNA?

Here is client's feedback.

"The account is showing on our old statements as shown in the attachment.

We'll also need to have the accounts showing on our new statements from DNA. Can I get a sample of those as well?

Note - InfoImage will no longer be processing our credit card statements as we've outsourced our credit cards to FIserv so no need to do any programming on those."

Thanks.

Please ignore my previous comment.

Per Keri Capote, this project is just unmasking the old statements. See comment below.

"Hi Kathy,

This project is just unmasking the old statements. The new core statements I am working on is not live yet so Dawn doesn't have access to provide samples for you. Diego provided samples for approval so you should be able to check anything you want to review on those. They were all approved and we are going into QA now so if you see something that you need to change please let me know right away.

Thanks,

"

There is an issue with the newly exported project. The images seem to be broken. I created a bug.


author: JIRAUSER11700

All good. Testing finished.
