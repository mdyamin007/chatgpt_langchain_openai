comment: When we enable this it implies all functions of message manager into one. Only thing we need to understand is if we need to have different pricing

It has to be one product and can't be differeniated

We need to repeat that we are consolidating b/w and color together and we need to have single pricing for that moving forward

In terms of analytics - we need to provide in-depth reports for this, and they can do the comparison and show the aggregate numbers for this.

comment: 2 DSI programmers needed.

One for UI and one for API

Tracking interface already developed before.
