title: ca-ipas-pr-01:  Production IPAS Server Configuration Request
description: [~ernestw]:  Hesham created the clone of the ca-ipas-pr-01 (i.e. the Production IPAS server). He copied from the existing ca-ipas-dv-01 VM server. Can you please configure this new ca-ipas-pr-01 server? I would like this completed so that we can test plugging in the+production+ dongle during 9/19 maintenance window.
