comment: Hi,

Due to some technical difficulties, I was not able to get this properly turned over, even though the Jira ticket was created on the date of TO. Can please someone advise that we can still make the sample date (6/25) as provided above?

Thank you

comment: Hi Daphne,

The sample is ready for client to review.


author: dyuen
comment: [~eric.yan]/ [~Igor.Khosid],

Please have QA review before I submit to client.

Thanks

Please change status to "Waiting for QA" if you need QA to check it prior sending to the client

Before submitting to QA, please provide PR ID


author: dyuen
comment: [~Igor.Khosid], I believe this is the mockup/mapping document you're requesting. Pam created it.

comment: [~dyuen] [~eric.yan]

Thanks, Daphne




author: dyuen
comment: [~eric.yan], can you confirm the following:
 # Notice code is 013?
 # This is not multiple pages.
 # Is this simplex or duplex? I believe it is simplex...
 # You have programmed to include a return envelope.

Thanks


author: eric.yan
comment: [~dyuen]
 # Yes, letter code is 013
 # it's single page and simplex setup.
 # Do you mean I should include return envelop in insert?


author: dyuen
comment: [~eric.yan]

Yes, please include a return envelope. Per ticket #18712, comment 12 FFFC indicated they want a return envelope for this letter.

comment: PDF looks good.QA passed ,ready for Client Review


author: dyuen
comment: Samples have been forwarded to client for review/approval.


author: dyuen
comment: [~eric.yan], client approved!

Per Louie of FFFC: "The samples look good. So, is this good to go-live July 9th as well as the certificate notices?"

Can you confirm that we can release this update on July 9th with the JEF DSi is working on?

Lastly, please provide paperwork for paper samples and parallel.

Thanks

comment: [~dyuen]: This project that Eric is working on will need to be released together with IS-170. Please advise if this is ok with FFFC.


author: dyuen
comment: [~William.Kong]I thought when we discussed we could release this prior to IS-170. I have not received any samples for IS-170 either.


author: william.kong
comment: Hi [~dyuen]: In our discussion on Friday, we discussed to make sure DSi's project has higher precedence to keep the original schedule. But this project would release together with IS-170 since it is the same developer and he can merge the code once. Please advise if if this is still ok. If so, i will want to update the Due Date to match up with IS-170.



[~eric.yan]: FYI.


author: eric.yan
comment: [~William.Kong][~dyuen]
I've reviewed the code and I'll be able to move it to QA by 7/8 tomorrow morning. 


author: william.kong
comment: [~eric.yan]: Per our conversation, please get started locally to merge your code, but do*+not+* release to parallel yet. In the meantime, [~Igor.Khosid] would like print samples and eNotice index file by tomorrow. We need to wait for [~dyuen]to confirm if client is ok for Tuesday live date instead of rushing and merging your code with DSi other letter project (redmine#48317)



We will update tickets on the client decision right after they return [~dyuen]'s call.



Thanks!

What is the PR ID?

comment: [~eric.yan]and [~Igor.Khosid]

I just spoke with FFFC. They are OK with pushing out this live date to 7/14, so we have some time. I did ask if we could have this code release the same time as IS-170 (scheduled to go live 7/20), I'm waiting to hear back on that. If FFFC is OK with releasing this update along with IS-170 I will let you both know.

Thanks!

QA test result: Pass and Status changed from QA In Progress to Request for Parallel

Eric, Please provide IS checklist


author: dyuen
comment: [~eric.yan], Please provide IS checklist so that I can submit this for parallel.


author: eric.yan
comment: [~dyuen] I thought this will go live with IS-170 together, can we do the parallel together as well?


author: dyuen
comment: [~eric.yan], that's fine. I thought I would do parallel for this since it was ready. I will wait until we have confirmation from client the samples from IS-170 look good, then we can proceed with parallel for both.


author: dyuen
comment: [~eric.yan]and [~Igor.Khosid], just a friendly reminder I need the IS checklist for this Jira story as well to initiate parallel.
