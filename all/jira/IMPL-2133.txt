title: FCBT[pvt][30831]: Enable automated advanced online proofing for print/electronic
description: As a permanent solution for L3 30831, configure setting up AOLP for electronic for the below CID's/Applications;

*CID's*:
CAFC
CTFC
FCBA
ALFC
MILB

Enable electronic AOLP as well for ALL of their LIQ applications:

LIQ Simple Bills
LIQ Simple Statements
LIQ Complex Bills
LIQ Complex Statements
Funds Held
Daily Notices


This will allow for the auto-posting needed to fully automate for these associations to eliminate the manual posting needed on the DP side once print samples are approved.

Note that this should ONLY be done for the above CID's. All other CID's (aside from PLBA which doesn't have AOLP) still have bills generated from their other core.

Enabling/Automation should be for the following:

Print AOLP
Electronic AOLP
Auto-posting
Auto-email trigger
