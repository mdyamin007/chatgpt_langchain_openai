title: Infotrac InfoDocs Inserts tab issue
description: Infodocs Inserts tab is having some issues. This tab is showing all inserts in a single page and upload new insert button is at bottom of the page. If begin date is null, it is showing current date. We need to correct this and show begin date value as end date if begin date is null. Also we should show paginated results sorted by closing date first.

Currently WTCU has some many inserts on production and customer need to scroll page to reach upload insert button. I have attached portion of screen shot of infodocs inserts page.
