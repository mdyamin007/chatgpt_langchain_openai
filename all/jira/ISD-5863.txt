title: FCSB - [24220][pvt] FCSB - inserts for month-end DDA & SAV
description: Internal notes: If we need to replace the insert, we must do the following:
* PC?: Unapprove the insert under Insert Management on InfoTRAC
* Replace the pdf for that insert
* Re-approve the insert
* ISD: delete the old insert entry from the inventory_pdfs table (note: fhnb and fnbt usually has different piece codes, so both must be removed)
* DP: reprocess the statement cycle with the estmt option

Per Keri, client now only wants consumer DDA to have inserts, they do not want consumer Savings to have insert.

Here are the DDA estmt indexes:

ms1_10312021_1_11262021_1425_fnbt.txt

ms1_10312021_1_11262021_1428_fhnb.txt

comment: [~yameelee] for sure, index files posted successfully on stage and I can see the one-day rewind insert for some accts in both the fnbt and fhnb ms1 index files. This looks good on stage.

comment: [~kdishroon] there's nothing needed for prod release on ISD's end, closing out this story.
