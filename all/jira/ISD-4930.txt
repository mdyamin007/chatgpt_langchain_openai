title: Hypercube - Welcome email success pop-up notification verbiage change
description: Requirement from OSCU



Whenever a welcome email is sent, we get a pop-up saying "Welcome notification has been sent."

The client is asking for this verbiage to be customizable. I think this is fine. Let's have a configuration that can replace this default verbiage.

This is the verbiage the client wants:Thanks! Weve sent a welcome message to your email address.
