comment: Hi [~MattL],

I'm a little confused on which letter I am updating. The mapping shows letter 019 -Rate Change Notice which uses letter type "RPCH2". The test file they sent is "RPCH1". Do I change letter 019 "RPCH2" to "RPCH1" and match the "23450_mapping_updated.png"?Also, Jira title also mentions letter 018, just double checking we are not making update for letter 018?


author: mattl
comment: We're making the update for both.


author: mattl
comment: we're adding the same template to letters 018 & 019

comment: [~MattL],

Thanks, got it. Can customer send a test file with letter code RPCH2 (letter 019) and RPCH3 (letter 018)? The current test file is for RPCH1 which will not generate these two letters.


author: mattl
comment: [~jun]I've requested a new file that includes both DN 019 and DN 018



Also I've attached a screen shot from the SOW just we're sure of what we're updating for them.

comment: Hi [~jun]



Please see attached Data file which should include both LN_RPCHNG notices.

comment: [~MattL],

The new file still only has "Letter | RPCH1" letter code which isn't for letter 018 (RPCH3) and 019 (RPCH2).


author: mattl
comment: [~jun], That is is correct.



RPCH1 will be replacing RPCH3 & RPCH2


author: jun
comment: [~MattL],

Am I suppose to replace both 018 and 019 to use RPCH1? Or replace only either 018 or 019? Or is this new letter?

If I replace both 018 and 019 to use RPCH1 then every time this file arrive 2 same copies are formatted.

author: mattl
comment: Hi [~jun]Client is reporting the sent DN19 with yesterday and its still appearing as DN19 in InfoTRAC. Please advise.






author: jun
comment: [~MattL]What do you mean by still appearing as 19? The code was released in the afternoon yesterday so any file processed before afternoon would still show the old template.

The file from yesterday 1449.0103.259390.LN_RPCHG.STM.pgpis empty so no letter is processed. Today file1449.0104.260007.LN_RPCHG.STM.pgp shows the update.
