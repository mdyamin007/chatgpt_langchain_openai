description: Email David to identify what is needed by his team to set-up a client on color message manager.



Is there a form that his team fills out, or is there a specific set of questions that his team needs answered to initiate a color message manager job.

comment: Per David:

By default, we support color messages on Message Manager currently. It is really depended on the Print team to confirm if the job is being printed on color or B/W. If color, they will request for the color version doing processing.

We dont really need to know if they job is color or B/W at this moment.
