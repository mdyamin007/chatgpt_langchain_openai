title: ACBK - [19190][pvt][in-house] Setup of Online proofing for Daily Notices
description: Summary: Add logos to online proofing for Daily Notices.



Specs:



Currently the OLP list contain arbitrary 30 accounts. Some of the accounts in this list can be NONPRINT and have color logo embedded resource within, thus we cannot place the logo for all accounts which can caused overlapping of existing logo.We will customize to create an account list for OLP that do not have embedded logo.



To do this we have to customize the global OLP script to extract a list of accounts for ACBK notice. Test with daily online proofing overlay.



Estimate will take about 10 hours. (In-House)
