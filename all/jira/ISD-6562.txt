comment: [~mac] [~Tin.Chak] the CU is leading towards needing us to strip the leading zeros in the account number. Please discuss with Sean what the impact is on the timing since including this change requires more work.

Thanks!

Hi Keri, we can strip the leading zeros, it shouldn't change the timing on my side. However, you will need to discuss with the print team to let them know that the leading zeros from the index files need to be removed. I don't know how long that would take them and affect our timing.

comment: [~mac]customer is asking:

For the no statement message wed like to know if we can remove everything that displays currently and simply go with:



It looks like you don't have any eStatements yet. When your first eStatement is available, we'll send you an email letting you know.



Let me know if we can make this change.



Thanks!

comment: [~mac] per SLCU:

Regarding the eStatements verbiage, we favor the placement of it to the right of the logo.

We would like to remove the leading zeroes and display the number as we do today.
