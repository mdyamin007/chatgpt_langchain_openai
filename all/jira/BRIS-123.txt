comment: Hi Will,



Working on this.

The secure 4 ftp has external DNS entry (8.8.8.8, 4.2.2.2).

I don't want to use IP in the exportfs. For the exportfs to work with the hostname I need to update the dns settting but not sure if it effect anything else on secure 4.

I will update you soon on this.

comment: [~premraj.patil]: I will close this ticket. Change of plans. Kent setup a+temporary+ Linux box under 10.4.10.10 to simulate having a secure4 & secure5 server to write files to the client_pickup directory. This is temporary because the permanent plan is to move the current physical secure4 & secure5 server's to Brisbane during the conversion weekend.



Here's the ticket Kent is helping me on.
