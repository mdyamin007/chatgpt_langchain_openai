comment: [~phoebe.george] [~enricob],

I created new samples but I am having issue uploading it here. Can I copy the samples somewhere else?


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~jun] Thanks, but I don't see the new attachment from my end. Can you copy it to my AC secure share folder by chance? 




author: jun
comment: [~phoebe.george]"mvcuea2_Samples_102821.pdf" copied to your AC secured folder.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~jun] I received confirmation today that the latest EA samples that you provided from the larger test file is approved. With the timeframe and your current project, are you able to continue with this project based on the work you completed, or should I review with the IS managers on new dates? Please let me know when possible, and I'll proceed accordingly. Thank you!


author: jun
comment: Hi [~phoebe.george],

I am missing the spec for archival. I can continue working on project when I get the spec. For estmt, index file is created. I will provide that to ISD.




author: jun
comment: Hi [~phoebe.george],

Just checking in to see if archival specs are ready?


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~jun] sorry for the delay, SOW has been updated with the specs:

I'm still working on the timeline though to plug in the dates for your final review/approval. Thanks!

comment: Hi [~phoebe.george],

Archival samples copied to MVCU client pickup folder. The file name is "mvcu_FICSEscrowAnalysis_102720_1.zip.pgp"


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~jun] Is it possible to update the PDF archival to remove the PGP encryption and only password protect the zipped file to use password: m7Cu*qP3x$

I'll update the SOW now; let me know when possible to create an updated sample file for PDF archival with this change. Thanks!

comment: [~phoebe.george]: [~jun]is at full capacity. We cannot put commitments to resume this project from "On Hold" to "In Progress" . Please be advise the live date may need to be in February 2022.



If there are any questions or concerns, please discuss with me on this.






author: phoebe.george
comment: [~William.Kong] Jun provided the dates for the PDF archival in the weekly internal call, which the managers no longer attend anymore but we still have for the existing projects. I already noted to Jun to provide me with the dates that coincide with his current workload. Please discuss with him and either of you can let me know on this ticket. If the timeline needs to be moved based on when he can resume the project, please update the ticket before Wed, 12/15, or he can provide another update in the next internal weekly call on 12/14.




author: william.kong
comment: [~phoebe.george]: Resource management come from managers and developers may not be aware of upcoming projects that we scheduled behind the scenes. This always have been the procedure that projects on hold for long period of time needing dates rescheduled needs to be requested. Date is already updated to Feb 28, 2022 before you responded above.


If things slow down, I will ask him to resume, but in the meantime live date will be 2/28/2022.



Thanks!

author: phoebe.george
comment: [~William.Kong] Please provide both the date that Jun can resume the project, not the new live date of the project. There are other departments impacted, so the live date needs to be confirmed once the dates IS is ready to resume the project. I will also need to know number of days the programmer will need once PDF archival samples are approved for any remaining scripting since print is already approved. From there, I can set a new live date since I need to factor in QA as well and can present this to the customer this week since we still meet with them weekly for the other on-going projects.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~William.Kong] [~jun] Please provide a confirmation on when Jun can restart this job - will it be as of 2/1 in order to go live by 2/28? 

Once re-started, please confirm how much lead time is needed to initiate for final QA. I need to present MVCU with an updated timeline for our call on Wed, 12/15.

I may need to cancel the internal call today depending on another meeting response for a client call so please provide an update by EOD today.


author: william.kong
comment: [~jun]: After you finish up EWBB Taxes project by Friday, please start resuming this project on Monday. This will clear up you EWBB & FFFC projects off your plate.

Please provide new samples by 12/22/2022 (Wednesday). This will give client plenty of time to review.

I will target code release date of 1/14/2022.



[~phoebe.george]: Please see if revised schedule above work better. I am able to move it up slightly instead of Feb.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~jun] i know that we are still discussing the resource allocation, but can you recopy the existing PDF archival test file that you originally created called mvcu_FICSEscrowAnalysis_102720_1.zip.pgp back to client pickup folder? I'll try to get final approval on this version in the meantime, even if we re-initate the setup later on. thanks!


author: jun
comment: [~phoebe.george]

I already updated to use the password zip. Is that okay? I copied the archival to client pickup. File name "mvcu_FICSEscrowAnalysis_102720_1.zip" and password "m7Cu*qP3x$".


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~jun] thanks jun, that is perfect, I have already updated the CU in the meantime.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~jun] I know you may not be able to resume this project soon, but wanted to provide the requested feedback/changes from MVCU on the PDF archival file noted below.

I've asked [~enricob] to update the SOW with this info as well.

For the Escrow Analysis Archival my team is inquiring if we can do the following name conventions based on where the file generates from on our end:
 # Please use index file names as follows
 # MvcuFICSEscrowAnalysis_*.idx
 # MvcuKeyStoneEscrowAnalysis_*.idx


 # Requested index record layout for *both* index files
 # ERIK J MADSON|81719935|10/20/2021|Escrow*_Statement*|999-99-9999|81719935_97.pdf

 # member/business name, account number, statement date, document type name, SSN (optional), and document file name

New archival samples copied to client pickup "mvcu_FICSEscrowAnalysis_102720_1.zip".


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~jun] thanks! Customer has been informed to review for final approval.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~jun] Customer is asking for these final updates - please let me know possible timing for updates:

We are still asking for the following 2 minor changes to please be made:

The sample index file name is *m*vcuFICSEscrowAnalysis_102720.idx. Would be good if they could capitalize the first *m* in the file name; e.g., *M*vcuFICSEscrowAnalysis_102720.idx. Their other active index files are capitalized that way and wed like consistency for our import templates.



The index record structure looks correct but, instead of Escrow_Statement, they have Escrow*_Statement*. They need to remove the asterisks.

comment: [~phoebe.george]: Can we make sure we get approval by Friday so that we have one week to QA & Parallel for code release for 1/14/2022.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~William.Kong] It is probably possible to get approvals by 1/7/22, but probably not possible for QA to complete next week for a 1/14 date due to their current schedule. I will check with Igor what is possible and determine new live date.


author: william.kong
comment: [~phoebe.george]: Thanks for the update! It would nice to fit in mid-Jan, but if [~Igor.Khosid]cannot, then I understand. 3rd week of January is going to be very tough on [~jun]. He and 3 others are designated to support taxes so I don't know how much Taxes will impact his focus to the release date. Let's discuss as soon as the client approves to see what can be done.






author: william.kong
comment: [~kericapote]: Can we target 1/17 for code release instead of a Friday 1/14? if so, let shoot for that date and update the Due date for this project. PLease advise.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~William.Kong] I'm the IM on this project, rather than Keri. Unfortunately, Igor does not have the resources to start QA for this until February timeframe.

[~jun] I did just receive final approval on the latest PDF archival sample though. If you are able to prepare for QA as normal, we can prep ahead of time for when QA is ready in February.

[~Igor.Khosid] FYI for now.

Phoebe, when you have a chance, please:
1. Attach updated mapping
2. Request print samples

[~phoebe.george]: 2/19/2022 is a Saturday. I hope we are not wanting to work on a weekend again. I'm tentatively marking 2/18/2022. Ideally, i'd prefer not to release code on a Friday. Can we move it to a Monday instead?
