title: Linux Jump Server access for PrintProcess Team members
description: Hi [~William.Kong],



We need VPN access to the DSI jump server (10.5.20.38) on port 22 for all our team members.

Members list and their IPs can be found here:

[https://app.smartsheet.com/sheets/mFf6v3fj63jmPqX5GwHQ7cF563hfF4mJ8pPmMhP1]



In addition, can we also allow VPN RDP access to the DSi Windows Jumpstation:

!image-2020-11-05-10-31-40-107.png!

This was requested in:

https://jira.infoimageinc.com/browse/NR-8





Also, please update that list with this server entry.



Thanks

comment: [~kent.chan]: Can we confirm if the other DSi Print users have firewall access to the brisbane dsi server? They confirmed only Rony is able to access the server but the others couldn't.

comment: [~William.Kong], I can confirm, from me and the other users, Linux jump station works now.

But not the windows one, RDP is still not working.
