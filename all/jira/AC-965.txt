title: HTBK - [34219][pvt][in-house] DP - HTBK DDA&SAV EOM Comm_CD error 
description: When Anwar worked on this for pdfi to afp2pdf, he also incorrectly changed the file name of the IMG list & PDF INX list passed in for each COMMERCIAL_CD.pl call. He removed an underscore between the jid and date for the PDF INX and removed an underscore between cid and date for the IMG list. Please see below and have him correct.



For every COMMERCIAL_CD.pl call in the HTBK DDA SCRIPT:

${cid}${jid}${mmdd}${yyyy}_PDF_INX.lisneeds to be changed to${cid}${jid}_${mmdd}${yyyy}_PDF_INX.lis

${cid}${mmdd}${yyyy}_IMG.lisneeds to be changed to${cid}_${mmdd}${yyyy}_IMG.lis
