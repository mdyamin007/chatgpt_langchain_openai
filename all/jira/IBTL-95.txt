The Stage's Scanner is working now. I have to change the database connection due to recent change on the Oracle server.



Thanks

Please re-try. I confirmed the ftpscanner on parallel is working from David. Please copy the data file to the infoftp_int so that it can be scanned and then rerun the job.

Also, please re-assign ticket to let me know whether or not it worked. Thanks!
