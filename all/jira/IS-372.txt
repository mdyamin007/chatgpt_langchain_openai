Yes, sample will be ready later today.

The attached is the suppressed records of the test data file by using the provided suppression list.




author: barnetts
comment: [~eric.yan],

Are you confirming that the suppression record is working?

Thank, Barnett 


author: barnetts
comment: [~eric.yan],

Can you please confirm to suppress the bad address indicator should be Y or N to suppress?
UTCU want to know which logic is correct. 


Thanks, Barnett 


author: eric.yan
comment: [~barnetts]

Currently I'm using "N" as an indicator to suppress.


author: barnetts
comment: Thank you [~eric.yan]


author: barnetts
comment: Hi [~eric.yan],

UTCU is wanting to update the logic. They want the logic to be updated to ( Y=bad address / suppress account) instead of ( N=bad address / suppress account). Can you please advise if this is possible?

Thanks, Barnett




author: eric.yan
comment: [~barnetts]

Yes, I could change it. Does the client needs new test file and new sample? I don't think it's necessary though.


author: barnetts
comment: Thanks [~eric.yan],

I hate to ask, but could you please provide new samples ?

Thanks, Barnett 


author: barnetts
comment: [~eric.yan],

I updated the description to reflect updated logic. 


author: eric.yan
comment: [~barnetts]

This is the current suppression list file. It has indicator "N" for suppression.

The client needs to provide a new file with "Y" as suppression indicator so that I could generate the new samples.

comment: Thanks [~eric.yan],

I have requested a new updated sample data file.

Thanks, Barnett 


author: barnetts
comment: Hi [~eric.yan],

The new test file is sent.

Thanks, Barnett

comment: [~barnetts]

Could you postpone the live date to 10/29


author: barnetts
comment: [~eric.yan],

Yes, we can postpone to 10/29 however they will not want to past that if possible. 


author: eric.yan
comment: [~barnetts]

The code is good for QA and released as soon as the client to provide new suppression list file.


author: barnetts
comment: Hi [~eric.yan],

Is the previous suppression file sent (utcu_bad_address_suppression_102121.txt.pgp) not working?

Thanks, Barnett 


author: eric.yan
comment: Hi [~barnetts]

The suppression file should be zipped and encrypted. So it should be utcu_bad_address_suppression_102121.zip.pgp.

I've changed it for the sake of time to run the test. But please ensure the client will send the suppression file in proper format in production.

I'll provide sample shortly.

comment: Per [~eric.yan]: Running testing right now. Once successfully, it will be on schedule for release on 10/29/2021


author: eric.yan
comment: [~barnetts]

Please see the updated .nop file. Two accounts are suppressed from the suppression list.

1284657

1284767

It's good for release once client could approve.


author: barnetts
comment: Thank you [~eric.yan],

Thanks, Barnett 


author: william.kong
comment: [~barnetts]: Sorry! For this ticket we have not received approval. Live date today will be missed. Next release date will probably be by 11/3 or later. Please get client approval and we will revisit which date after 11/3 would be the revised go live date.


author: barnetts
comment: [~eric.yan],

For the updated test suppression file, UTCU wants to know if only the 2 accounts were suppressed.  They are stating that all of them had a Y on the report.

Thanks, Barnett 


author: barnetts
comment: [~eric.yan],

UTCU is stating that there should of been 20 suppressed files instead of 2. Are you able to check the data and confirm?

Thanks, Barnett 


author: eric.yan
comment: [~barnetts]

There are 20 accounts in the suppression list. 4 accounts are suppressed from print by the paperless list already (boxed below), so only 2 accounts appear to be suppressed by the suppression list (underlined below).

comment: [~eric.yan]: Looks like [~barnetts]updated the due date to 11/5 in the EPIC and did not inform us. I just updated your story


author: william.kong
comment: [~barnetts]: Any feedback? unfortuantely we will need to change the live date again..


author: barnetts
comment: [~eric.yan] / [~William.Kong],

I am going back and forth with UTCU. They are wanting to see samples where the entire suppression list is working.  I have informed them that the logic works but they provide file needs all the accounts to work. They are working on getting a new test file. As a result, I am pushing the due date back. 

Thanks, Barnett


author: barnetts
comment: Hi [~eric.yan],

Please see UTCU comment below.
We will work on getting a new file.  
Would you please also clarify on what the following means?  Does this mean we actually need to zip the two files together into one file before sending?
Please follow the following naming convention and zipped together with the VISA data file.  
utcu_CCM_stmxt _<MMDDYY>.zip.pgp  ->  utcu_bad_address_suppession_<MMDDYY>.txt 

Thanks, Barnett

New test data: test/utcu_CCM_stmxt_110821.zip.pgp / 54.42 Mb (11/08/2021 09:45 PST)
Per UTCU, "It is a combination of both the CCM_stmxt and the bad address_suppresion as requested."

Thanks, Barnett

comment: [~barnetts]

Please advise the client to follow the original file structure, where the data file and suppression list are zip and encrypted separately.
 - data file
 utcu_CCM_stmxt_mmddyy.zip.pgp

 - bad address account list file name from client:
 utcu_bad_address_suppression_mmddyy.zip.pgp



I've reorganize the test file for testing purpose and will update the result later.

The suppression list only has three account to suppress (makred by "Y")

Only one is in the data file and it's suppressed by estatment.

comment: [~barnetts]: Today is the live date (11/17). Please get an update from client. We*cannot*++ delay this project into December. If this project does not go live before end of November, then we have to resume this project in February/March 2022 timeframe. Please work with client to set this expectation.



My understanding from [~eric.yan]is that we are very close to completing. It's just a matter of address their data inconsistency issue(s).

comment: [~barnetts]: Code Freeze deadline is December 15, 2021. You changed the live date without confirm with me or [~TunA] . [~eric.yan]is reserved for Tax season and we cannot impact his work load for December 15 into end of January.

I will make this project as one-time exception to 12/17/2021. If this date is past, we will need to reschedule in Feb/Mar 2022 live date.

This is the 2nd and last courtesy reminder as I've already provide my reminder end of November:

comment: Hi [~eric.yan],
UTCU has sent an updated test data file.
Per UTCU, "I sent over another test file as listed below for when code freeze is over.  It contains almost 40 accounts verified with bad address and paper statement.  Half of those are credit cards that are overdue so we can test the late notice being suppressed due to bad address."
