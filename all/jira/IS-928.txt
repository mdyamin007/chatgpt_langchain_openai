Just wanted to note that is no parallel ID because the dfa for KYCUDL017, 18, 21 and 23 are currently in another parallel and will be released first. I will include them in mine once it goes live. However, I have exported the project files and attached the samples for review.

Also for KYCUDL008, it has not been setup so a sample is not provided, but the update to the logo position in the dfa has been made.
