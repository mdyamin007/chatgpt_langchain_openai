title: OSCU - [30057][pvt][RUSH] Amortized Stmt Update (RUSH) 
description: OSCU - Amortized Stmt Update (RUSH)
* App: OSCU-Stmt - Amortized PDF Format
* Programming Hours: 3hrs (RUSH CHARGES)
* Due Date: 07/05
*  Pending Timeline and QA time / Print samples and parallel testing

*Description of Work:* Modify composition program to parse the new PDF format for the OSCU Amortized PDF file format. OSCU needs to verify counts prior to going live and confirm that we parse the total number of documents correctly. (Because file format changes, we will need to redo the RedTitan coding. Can you please quote the following ASAP.)

Developer will be Thomas

OSCU, has attached the FICS CS upgrade documentation which has the enhancement to statements highlighted. It confirms the redesign and reformat, including moving the Recent Activity Detail section to a separate page to allow for more transactions.

Per OSCU,

Details regarding the Amortized Loan Statements changes:

Amortized Loan Statements  The statement has been redesigned as follows:

1. The Recent Activity Detail section of the statement has been moved to a separate page to allow more room for additional transactions. The format of the activity is similar to what is provided on the Loan Activity Report.
2. A shaded box has been added to the Billing Message on the statement and is now displayed in bold font. This section of the statement also allows for approximately twice as much text.
3. The Print Comments section has been moved to the right side of the statement below the Billing Message, and also allows for approximately twice as much text.
4. A new section, Year-To-Date Totals, has been added below the Print Comments section. The following amounts are displayed:

a. Principal Paid
b. Interest Paid
c. Taxes Paid
d. MIP Paid
e. Insurance Paid

comment: Hi [~barnetts],

I spoke to [~thomasY]. He will provide samples later today (06/22) or tomorrow (06/23).

[~William.Kong]mentioned in email that *"client +must+ validate counts to ensure we parsed the total number of accounts correctly."*

So once Thomas provide the sample, please work with QA and client for sample approval. The LIVE date depends on approval date.



Thanks,

Tun

comment: Hi [~thomasY] / [~TunA]

The Amortized statements has two data files that runs together. The update made was for the commercial loan. The consumer loan format should be the same.  Can you please advise if we are able to process the Consumer Mortgage file without the commercial loan file? 
* Letter code - (401) Consumer_Mortgage = OSCU_Consumer_mtg_MMDDYY.pdf
* Letter code - (402) Commercial_Loan = OSCU_Commercial_Loan_MMDDYY.pdf

Thanks, Barnett 


author: thomasy
comment: [~Igor.Khosid]Does 402 look ok? We can ignore letter 401, I didn't make any changes to it and can confirm the production looks correct.


author: thomasy
comment: [~barnetts]You requested print samples from the *4a* file. I said to print from the *is* file. The samples printed don't have any letter 402.



DP can process 401 alone if they can remove letter 402 from the zip file.


author: igor.khosid
comment: [~thomasY] [~barnetts]
I do not have 402 - only 401


author: barnetts
comment: Thank you [~thomasY]/ [~Igor.Khosid],

I will request DP to process the 401 alone by removing letter 402 from the zip file.

Thanks ,Barnett

comment: [~barnetts]Please confirm if we can proceed to release 402 with what Igor noted above (#3). Note that it would have to be fixed on the data provider's side.

comment: HI [~thomasY] / [~Igor.Khosid],

I spoke with OSCU last night and they should hopefully have an answer later today.

Thanks, Barnett 


author: barnetts
comment: Hi [~thomasY] / [~Igor.Khosid]

I spoke with OSCU and they are aware of the verbiage showing through the window of the envelope for both letters. They are also aware that it must be corrected on their end for both letters. OSCU has approved of the 401 letters (consumer) to be mailed separately from the 402 letters via Infotrac.  

[~thomasY], can you please advise on what can be done for the overprint issue for the 402 letters (commercial)?  Maybe we can temporally created a  a cover letter as a workaround?

Thanks, Barnett 


author: william.kong
comment: [~barnetts]: We would need to quote an additional 1hr for the heavies page. Please advise if client wants to proceed. Also, please advise if there is a static content that need to be in place in the coverpage.



e.g.: Please see next page for your statement.. etc etc etc....



If client wants to pursue, please update the work order and get it signed and updated in Jira as well.
