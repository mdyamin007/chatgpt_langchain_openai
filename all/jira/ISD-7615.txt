comment: [~gthillaivel] can you check again? If the issue persists, can you confirm if it's happening for all the different letter codes?

comment: [~gthillaivel] I just realized BKPL only has print online proofing, so we might need IS to check. I'll  assign this bug ticket to Ruman who seems to be the IS programmer for IS-1244.

[~rumanb] Can you take a look? Gnana is not seeing any accts on job status when searching for specifically letter codes 107 and 109. This is the dtjobid on stage: 133778-C08.01-V22592
