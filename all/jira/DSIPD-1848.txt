comment: How bounceback API works:
 #  infoservice pulls all the P_JOB within the given time range and makes a P_JOB list.
 #  infoservice make a list with all apiJobId from the P_JOB list
 #  infoservice call notifyservice for each apiJobId to get required data for a particular job
 #  Notifyservice retrieve all the data from mongoDB for that job.
 #  create a CSV file with all information and return it to the caller.
 #  infoservice iterates each row of the csv that is given by notifyservice.
 #  If the status is Bounced then create a query on oracle for notification preference.



Some assumption:

Lets say, there are 100 jobs and each job has 3000 notifications and 50 notifications are bounced in each job.



Then how many queries and API calls occur on both infoservice and notificationservice side?



1 query in oracle to get all the P_JOB

100 API calls to notifyservice to get all information about the job.

50*100 =5000 query to get the notification preference.



100 mongo query for job level information.

3*100=300 mongo query to get all the notification level information.



In summary, there will be 5001 oracle query, 100 API calls and 400 mongo query.



To solve the issue, I believe we should make the API call asynchronous.
