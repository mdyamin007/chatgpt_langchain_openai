comment: [~phoebe.george] I've enabled AOLP for loans on all environments. Ideally we should test on pilot/stage first since this may involve multiple reposting/reprocessing to get it right. In addition to PC creating the dt_job_id and enable estmt job tracking, the correct dt_job_id needs to be tied to the index file in the IS database. I don't remember what IS needs to do exactly, but these are some of the items we need to ensure AOLP works as expected.
