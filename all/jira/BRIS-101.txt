We don't have the capacity to provide what's the requests are. But if you or your team get stuck and need more memory/cpu or disk space while working on any of the VM's we can increase that accordingly to your request. Please let me know if you are ok with this or we can discuss more on a call.

For all the remaing dev servers request also, I am gonna give 2 cpu/4GB ram/and 100GB disk space. You should get more VM's by eod today and tomorrow.



Thanks,

Prem
