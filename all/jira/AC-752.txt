We are upgrading our system on 8/7/22 and there are a couple of new transaction descriptions in the statement raw data file that we will need to change for our 8/15/22 Visa statements.

This is the current mapping for the transaction descriptions:


 # There are some accounts that will have a description noted after a payment. We dont want this description listed after payment, we only want it to list Payment.

<Transaction AmountType="Credit">

 <FeatureName>Purchases</FeatureName>

 <MerchantCategoryCode>6012</MerchantCategoryCode>

 <ChannelType>ExternalInteractive</ChannelType>

 <TransactionType>Payment</TransactionType>

 <TransactionDate>6/7/2022</TransactionDate>

 <PostingDate>6/7/2022</PostingDate>

 <EffectiveDate>6/7/2022</EffectiveDate>

 <Amount>-2501.68</Amount>

<Description>Highest rate payment applied to PrincipalDebit transactions.</Description>

 <DescriptionSummary>Payment</DescriptionSummary>
 # There are also some accounts that will have a description noted for the periodic finance charge. We dont want this description listed after the periodic finance charge, we only want it to list PeriodicFinanceCharge



</Transaction>

 <Transaction AmountType="Debit">

 <FeatureName>Purchases</FeatureName>

 <MerchantCategoryCode>6012</MerchantCategoryCode>

 <ChannelType>Batch</ChannelType>

 <TransactionType>PeriodicFinanceCharge</TransactionType>

 <TransactionDate>6/9/2022</TransactionDate>

 <PostingDate>6/15/2022</PostingDate>

 <EffectiveDate>6/15/2022</EffectiveDate>

 <Amount>1.26</Amount>

<Description>DaysInPeriod=31; Balance=115.00; Rate(APR)=12.900000; Rate(Daily)=0.035342</Description>

Here is a snip of the payment with the black line through what we don't want to print on the statement.
