comment: Hi Shun,

I'm trying to gain access to the SSO test page to view the accounts that were posted. However, it is showing me an error. I tried these accounts:

!image-2022-05-23-16-10-37-094.png!



!image-2022-05-23-16-10-54-149.png!



Do you know if the values I'm using is accurate?



Thanks,

Phoebe

comment: [~phoebe.george] it works for me and I was able to login successfully on pilot. Besides the prefilled and data string fields, all I had to do was input my email address and switch out one of the account numbers. Can you compare against my screenshot and try again? My guess is there's something wrong with the data string you put in for the Data field. Thanks

comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] Thanks for sending the screenshot! I found the issue on my end. I had to use 'hypercube' in the drop down, and also, I had an extra space after the key when I cut and paste it. Thanks for your help, all looks good from my end. Will confirm once customer approves. Thanks!
