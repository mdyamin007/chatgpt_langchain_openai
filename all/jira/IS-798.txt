Here is the archival xml index file for Visa statement.

[^Visa.ofcu_archival_index.xml]

This file cannot be added to this ticket (2.4 MB) so I copied it to your folder as well.



I also copied the zip file that contained this index file and individual PDF files to your folder (file size 470 MB)

ofcumv1_01172022.zip

Let me know if customer wants to send it in FTP client_pickup folder.

comment: Hi [~andyp], 

OFCU wants a XML statement for every 100 PDF statements for each batch of statements?
There were some issues with some statements not processing and this would cause the batch to fail. They found that some business names contained special characters which XML does not allow. Could you use Escape Sequence code when these special characters are found?
Symbol (name) -> Escape Sequence
& (ampersand) -> &
' (apostrophe or single quote) -> '

Thanks, Barnett

comment: Hi [~andyp], 

For creating an XML index file for every 100 PDF statements in a given batch, OFCU wants 1 zip file containing all the PDF statements (as is currently), along with all the split XML index files.

Thanks, Barnett

Can you please advise on status?

comment: Hi [~andyp]

OFCU says that the XML index files for every 100 PDF statements can be changed to 500 statements if this will speed things up.

Thanks, Barnett

comment: [~barnetts]: As discussed via Zoom. There is a last minute scope change communicated an hour ago. Please consult with Peter and YaMee to discuss with Andy to provide revised timeline due to last minute spec change. They will be able to better provide a better revised timeline since original timeline is missed and there is a last minute spec change.

comment: [~berezinez]

The description of this update is in the story up there.

There is no update for estatement, so we don't need to check estatement posting.

The archival individual PDF files and xml index file were in the following folder.

/z/pdf_afp/ofcu/ofcumv1

Please look in pdf folder and also batch folder.

Papyrus is in demo mode now. I will export project file when license backup.
