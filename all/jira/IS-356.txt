comment: Hi [~rony], Just checking in on progress of the tax form updates. Do you need any of the latest resources/projects? Please let me know if you are missing the latest resources/projects or anything you are need.

Sorry, we couldn't give much time to it cause of other project urgencies. But we started now. Would it be possible to provide us the publications pdf*p1220.pdf* for this year?



Thanks,

Rony




author: jun
comment: Hi [~rony],

Here is link to p1220.pdf. However, it looks like the version is still for 2020. I will keep monitoring for the new version.

https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p1220.pdf


author: rony
comment: Hi [~jun] Yes, I also searched for it and got confused. Looks this pdf is same as the previous year. Ok, let me know if you find this year publication when available.


author: jun
comment: Hi [~rony],

For now we should start updating the resources like the backer, dfas, projects and control files(if needed) to prevent delay on waiting for the publication. The mapping will need to wait until the new publication is out.


author: rony
comment: Hi [~jun]

The pdf for 1042S is little bit confusing.

This section from previous year looks like not present for this year:

!image-2021-09-24-14-10-34-241.png!



Also the outlook also got little changed:

previous year:

!image-2021-09-24-14-13-40-668.png!



This year:

!image-2021-09-24-14-14-00-199.png!





Also in the pdf the the box for front is not given.

So can you give me some instructions here for backer where to start ?



Thanks,

Rony

The current "1042-S_2021.pdf" was taken from the wrong link on IRS website. I've attached the correct PDF "f1042s.pdf".

comment: Hi [~rony],

The p1220.pdf is updated on IRS website. Attached "p1220.pdf".

comment: Hi [~jun]

Previously I guessed you helped us to turnover to qa. Would it be possible to guide us about that. In total what did you provide them and where did you get the data file?

And should we provide directly to qa if anything is completed from us or need to provide sample first?



Thanks,

Rony


author: jun
comment: Hi [~rony],

The data file can be old data file but with the year in A record changed to year 2021. This way the new front+backer can be generated. Please let me know if you are missing any data file then I can find one and change the year for you. Please use latest DFA.

The updated tax projects can be uploaded to parallel environment. If you have access to /d/iss/qa/Tax2021/, please export the project there too.

I can update QA with what form is completed so they can start checking.



Also, here is what's new for 2021 that's on page 12 of 1220.pdf publication. There are several new amount codes and some fields are in new positions.

comment: Extremely sorry [~TunA]. We could complete only the backer parts by this week. We didn't touch for the front yet. We will start front from next week and will provide to qa as soon as whatever we will complete.



Thanks,

comment: Rony,



Can you give us a timeline for these samples?


author: william.kong
comment: [~Jessica]: [~rony]is OOO today due to holiday.



[~rony]: Per [~TunA]'s prioritization, please work on the common forms sequentially starting with the common forms like 1098, 1099i as the highest priority.  We want to update on form by form instead of updating all the forms at a time. 1098 and 1099i has the highest volume and want to have ample to time to make sure we can review these two forms first.






author: rony
comment: Hi [~jun]

All the standard and non standard backers are done. We started working on front from today.

As soon as we complete a front we will provide to qa folder and update resources to parallel.

Thanks,

Rony

comment: Hi [~jun]

1098GEN_21.zip is in/d/iss/qa/Tax2021/ folder.

The front changes are:
 # Updated mapping for foreign address indicator from 247 to 287.
 # Updated mapping for first payee name line from248-287 to288-327.
 # Making second payee name line empty. I am actually not sure should I make the*second payee*(&GRPB_F22[&GRPB_PTR]) empty or&EXTRA_ADDR[&GRPB_PTR] empty. Let me know on this.



!image-2021-10-19-01-03-05-587.png!



Parallel id:20211018115529. Also uploaded the non standard backer there.



Thanks,

Rony

comment: [~rony],

Looks like the first payee name is now in field 288 for &GRPB_F21 and second payee name used to be&GRPB_F22 but it's not in the mapping anymore.&GRPB_F22 is empty looks correct based on mapping.


author: rony
comment: Hi [~jun]

Per your previous message,

*_"&GRPB_F21_* is empty looks correct based on mapping"



Did you want to say*_&GRPB_F22_*, cause this is the one I made empty.



Thanks,

Rony

comment: Hi [~jun]

1099R is provided to the QA folder. Uploaded in parallel too with nonstandard backer. The update is the same as for 1098.
 # Updated mapping for foreign address indicator from 247 to 287.

where can I find the changes for 1042s? I couldn't find it in publication 1220.


author: jun
comment: [~rony],

I think the 1099C ogl+ovl resources for the front and 1099C,1099S,1099B DFA+prj files aren't uploaded to parallel id. Please add to parallel id.



The 1042-S publication just got posted. It's attached "p1187.pdf" and link is [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p1187.pdf]The new section doesn't show any new mapping on page 7.

[~jun] Oh my apology . Those are uploaded.


author: tuna
comment: Hi [~rony] ,

For IS-356 and IS-360, both are overdue for sample date.

could you please provide estimate date for completing resources for all forms? So that, we can request Jessica to adjust time line. We should not be later than 11/10. So that we will have time to QA + Parallel test before 11/24.

Thanks,

Tun

author: william.kong
comment: [~TunA]: Per Rony, all the backers are updated. Rony and Anwar will work on it one form at a time for the front.. They will submit one form at a time as they are getting completed.


author: rony
comment: [~TunA]

By next week we will submit all. We couldn't assign this to any other dev so I and Anwar did the update whenever we found time.

*Note:*I still cannot find1099OID, 1099Q, 1099SA, 5498SA for 2021 on IRS website. We might need to just increment the year like last year for missing publications.

comment: Hi [~rony],

Thank you for quick turnaround for the tax forms.



We have an existing issue that we need to fix for 1099-INT backer for 2021. IDCU customized 1099-INT form (IDCU9I.dfa) also uses the standard tax backer. The backer on IDCU 1099INT is overlapping the 2d barcode on the bottom left. For the standard 1099-int backer, the margin will need to be narrower to accommodate more room to fix the overlapping issue.If necessary, we can move "Box 9" to the bottom of first column and move up a little bit for both column. But the entire verbiage cannot be higher than 7/4". Please take a look at team support ticket 23837

1099nec is uploaded.

One thing to mention about the front. In previous year:

!image-2021-11-09-23-19-38-153.png!



We just removed the *FATCA filing* box for this year.

so looks like this:

!image-2021-11-09-23-20-26-840.png!



So if you notice box 4 there is a blank box. But in the publication pdf of the current year :

!image-2021-11-09-23-21-57-022.png!



Would that be a problem?



Thanks,

Rony






author: jun
comment: Hi [~rony],

It should be ok. Based on the what's new section for 2021, field 548 is blank now which was used for the fatca box,

Thanks


author: jun
comment: Hi [~rony],

The 1099R update (ticket 24008) takes too much time since it requires a lot of shifting around. We will need to put it aside and add it as an enhance request for next tax year. No need to move for 1099R.

Operations reported in ticket 24012 that the right side of 1042-S front page is too close. The right side can be trimmed down a little to accommodate more room. Please see screenshot below and move the front form's right side about 0.12 inches shorter.

Thanks for updating 1042s!



Here is publication for 5498SA form:[^f5498sa_21.pdf]

The IRS website still don't have publication for1099OID, 1099Q, 1099SA forms. We can create 2021 dfa, overlay, ogl and increment the tax year from 2021 to 2022 in the backer. The what's new section field update on page 11 bullet point 5 sec 3 should still apply for these forms.

Let us know when to release to prod.


author: jun
comment: Hi [~rony]

Sorry, I forgot to mention I've already released the code. You don't need to release. Please remove the parallel ID when you can. I think your parallel id include non-standard tax too and have to wait for both to finish to remove it.


author: rony
comment: [~jun] thanks for the update. Changing status to done.
