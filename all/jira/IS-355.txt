etax_1099a_12312021_311_11032021_100708_alfc.txt - errored
* the index file contained invalid acct types such as LN888 rather than just LN (I fixed these in the file manually for now)
* this afp folder is not in the expected location, therefore it cannot post: 1099a-12312021-311/

Can you look into the alfc file issue?
