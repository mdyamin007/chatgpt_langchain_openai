title: WTCU -[33047] [pvt] HELOC Billing Notice - APR Printing Issues [in house]
description: Currently ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE is coming from 501 record 02 field.  But sometimes if 501 appears multiple times and the values get overlapped with each other.  In this scenario we will not show the value, instead will display this hard coded text: "See Statement" as requested on 10/12/22.
