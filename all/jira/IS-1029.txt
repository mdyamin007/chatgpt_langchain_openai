comment: [~phoebe.george] - Are we supposed to set up CASS report for all the CIDs in FCBT or is it just ALFC?

Thanks!
Rukmani


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~rukmaniR] It would be for all CID's, however, they will let us know specifically which production files they would like us to use for the address clean up. they want to use the ALFC data file that i noted for the test report. Let me know if any questions. Thanks!


author: JIRAUSER11100
comment: [~phoebe.george] - Should we zip the reports with password or pgp encrypt them? Please provide the password or encryption key.

Thanks!


author: JIRAUSER11100
comment: [~phoebe.george] I've attached the files "alfclq1110_cass.mod.txt" and "alfclq1110_cass.err.txt"

Thanks!


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~rukmaniR] Thank you! The sample reports have been forwarded to the bank. I asked them the questions yesterday about the zip/pgp/password and they will confirm with their IT team and confirm. I'll update you once approved and confirmed. Thanks!

author: JIRAUSER11100
comment: [~phoebe.george] - Did you get any response from the client?

Thanks!
Rukmani


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~rukmaniR] Sorry for the delay, FCBT let me know that it is still under review with other internal depts on their end. They will not be able to meet the approval date for the 5/31 live date. Let me know if best to set a new approval date of 5/31, what your soonest live date can be. Thanks!


author: JIRAUSER11100
comment: [~phoebe.george] - It depends on how many other CIDs they want us to create the report for.

Thanks!
Rukmani


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~rukmaniR] I have received approval on the CASS sample report. FCBT confirmed that this will need to be setup for the following CID's at this time. However, it will eventually be setup for all 13 associations, so not sure if best to update at this time for all. Here are the priority CID's

CAFC, PLBA, ALFC, MILB, CTFC, FCBA, AGFC

Based on the approval date and added CID's to include, please confirm new target live date and I'll update the due dates accordingly for the story and epic.


author: JIRAUSER11100
comment: [~phoebe.george] - Thanks for the update. We need the data file to test these CIDs. We will be able to give the new live date once it is provided.

Thanks!
Rukmani

Thanks!
Rukmani


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~rukmaniR] These are approved. Let me know next steps when possible to move forward. Thanks!

Also, can you let me know what a new target QA start date will be, I can confirm with Igor on his schedule and target a new live date. Thanks!


author: JIRAUSER11100
comment: [~phoebe.george] - Are they going to add more CIDs? If not, I'll talk to Ya Mee and let you know the new timeline.

Thanks!


author: JIRAUSER11100
comment: [~phoebe.george] - Live date is 6/30. I can move it to QA whenever you want me to. There's no parallel ID since I didn't check-in  any file.

Thanks!


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~rukmaniR] can you confirm if this code release is based on just the CID's that you have rec'd test data for, or any of the FCBT's child-CIDs since their data file structure is the same? Thanks!


author: JIRAUSER11100
comment: [~phoebe.george] - It's only the CIDs that we received the test data for. We are just adding the CIDs to a table.

Thanks!


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~rukmaniR] Sorry for the delay on this project update!

I confirmed with FCBT if we can produce one more set of test reports for CAFC noted below. Once approved, we can move forward with release for the CID's noted in the testing:

cafc_liq_simpstmt_23_07302022.txt.pgp - received 7/30/22

cafc_liq_simpbillstmt_273_07132022.txt.pgp - received 7/13/22



Thank you!

comment: [~rukmaniR] I finally have approval on this! Please let me know when you can move forward with the release. I believe in a previous comment it was noted that parallel will not be required - can you confirm with Yamee or Peter that is the case?

Thanks!
Rukmani


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~rukmaniR] Can you prepare the necessary information for QA?

I still need to schedule this with [~Igor.Khosid] , but wanted to get timeframe from you on when you feel you can have the program ready for QA, so I can schedule with him accordingly.



Thanks,

Phoebe


author: JIRAUSER11100
comment: [~phoebe.george] - It's ready for qa. All I have to do is provide the updated table to them. 

Thanks!
Rukmani


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~rukmaniR] I received your update, can you please prepare this for final QA and move to Igor when ready.

[~Igor.Khosid] I'll setup a quick call to discuss tomorrow morning so you have the background for this setup. Thanks!

Thanks!


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~rukmaniR] Thanks for the follow-up; FCBT will not require a password on the zipped file when created. Thanks!

Thanks!
