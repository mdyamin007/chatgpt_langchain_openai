comment: Hi [~dyuen]

One thing to reconfirm , do we need to display the insert only for September month?

If yes , is it for this year or every year?



Thanks


author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~rony],

This insert for this September and this year only.

Thanks,

comment: Thanks guys. Samples have been forwarded to MFCU for review/approval.


author: dyuen
comment: [~rony], we worked on an update to remove/prevent duplicate names. The test samples that you provided have duplicate names. To confirm, in production, duplicate names will NOT appear, correct?



From MFCU:

I sent the inline proof for Change of Terms to the Business departments for approval. However, I have a question. The sample proofs are showing duplicate names in the Additional Signer line. This surprised me, because I thought we already implemented a fix on that problem. Can you look into why there are duplicate names?

comment: FYI, [~dyuen]
Usually, I generate PDFs from Papyrus and there was no duplication of names on those data. 
[~rony] [~misbah.uddin@dsinnovators.com] please next time, if you provide PDFs please do it on the same data as in the uploaded project (in QA folder).

comment: Hi [~misbah.uddin@dsinnovators.com] [~rony], the samples are approved!

Per MFCU: "We have a full signoff on the mock up for the Change in Terms inline insert for Sept. Inserts are approved."

I think we should do parallel since this is an inline insert, do you guys agree? Or will print samples suffice?

Thanks

comment: Hi [~dyuen]

Yes we need parallel . Please create parallel form after qa approved.

Per client:

have just heard from the business unit that they caught a verbiage error on this Change of Terms In-line Insert. Unfortunately, we will need to make changes. We have two sections that need a verbiage change:
 # MFCU30875VerbiageChange1.png
 # MFCU30875VerbiageChange2.png

I have attached a copy of the full insert ( Mock Up Change in Terms updated 9.8.22 ns.docx). Please let us know if these changes can be made, the timing and any additional costs associated._Thank you!_

This would be the same effort as before. Please ask new tiff from the client.

Additional hours would be 2 hours.

I believe this is an exceptional scenario. Normally we should have a new programming request, and a new timeline so that it doesn't hamper with existing assigned jobs we have. We are updating it but just sharing my comments.

comment: Hi [~misbah.uddin@dsinnovators.com], I have another round of changes that need to be done. I'm hoping this is the last round. Can you confirm how many hours total should be quoted for these changes?

Per MFCU:

"The review team found a couple moreinconsistencies with the wording. We have made edits. However, I have made all swear this is absolutely the last time for any changes. They have all agreed.

Please see the attached documents: 1) Word version showing where the verbiage was edited; 2) a PDF final version; 3) a Tiff final version - in a ZIP folder."

author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~misbah.uddin@dsinnovators.com], MFCU noted that the quality of the insert looked grainy so they provided a new TIFF in a higher resolution. Can you create a new sample with the attached TIFF?

Per MFCU: "We have Marketing and Compliance approval on this insert for Change of Terms. Please go ahead and notify your team. Thank you."

A couple items:
 # Can you provide an updated test dpvs, etc for another parallel test?
 # Can you move the same code to the PILOT environment? MFCU wants to do a test run and I want to ensure this code is in pilot for them to review.

Thanks!
