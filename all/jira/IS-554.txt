I've created the new eform in test environment. Do you know if DSI has finished updating the changes? Is the change is parallel or production?


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~eric.yan] I'm checking with DSI on the other Jira story that he's assigned to you and I tagged you as well for when he responds. It's definitely not in production though, as we were still testing. But he did provide a DPVS already previously, so it is probably still just in test environment.

ok, I'll follow up in the other story as I saw the output doesn't look right. I'm using the latest sample from parallel.

EFORM preview is good. DSI is generating sample for client review.

comment: [~eric.yan] - printed hard copy samples (and PDF version) are all approved! We are pending an issue on the electronic/posted version to be resolved, but wanted to let you know the print is approved in the meantime.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~eric.yan] Electronic/posted version is approved; I informed QA/Igor and DSI through IS-399 as well. Thanks!


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~eric.yan] Are there any items you need to prepare for release on your end for this update? Thanks!

I'm ready to release once QA is done. I don't think parallel for print is needed since the print sample is approved by OPs and client already.
