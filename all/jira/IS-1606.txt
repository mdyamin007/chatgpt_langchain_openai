author: andreav
comment: [~tanmay] - Once the USPS endorsement is added, please provide a new dpvs, file id and image range. QA requires a new set of printed samples.


author: andreav
comment: [~tanmay] - Client's feedback on the physical samples:
# Perforation is missing on the notices with remittance.
# Make logo larger so that return address is more readable but still fit within envelope window. 

Client confirmed color and all else looks good. Please provide a new dpvs. Reminder to include the USPS endorsement. Please also include a heavy sample. If heavies don't occur, please create one for sampling purposes.

author: andreav
comment: [~tanmay] - OPS has confirmed the batch 2 passes tap test and perforation check. As discussed in today's meeting, please turn over to QA tomorrow morn. For parallel, we will need a test file that includes all notices so we can test that all notices pull from trays correctly. 


author: ratnam
comment: [~andreav]Robbie from the Bank is not able to populate data for noticesBP2402P, LN2285P LN2360P. And data files recieved so far should include data for rest of the notices. [~tanmay] will run the data files and let us know if there is any other notices missing data apart from above three. I advice we should proceed with whatever notice data we have so far.

We have test files forBP2402P, LN2285P LN2360P that were provided previously but not in right naming convention if Tanmay is able to rename and use those files.



Thanks

author: andreav

 # Some of the notices run too long and overlap into the perforated part. This may not be able to be corrected ? {color:#ff0000}Please review why the content is overlapping?{color}
 # Some of the envelopes had Temp Return Service Requested kind of cut off at the end. Im not sure if that matters or not for USPS mailing{color:#ff0000}Please review it is being cut off?{color}
 # The SD3080P didnt have a perforation. Im thinking it should even though its not a notice with a MICR. The customer still needs to provide their signature and tear it off.{color:#ff0000}We should be able to add this and I updated DN Matrix within SOW to include perf line.{color}

Im not sure if that matters or not for USPS mailing{color:#ff0000}Please review it is being cut off?{color}{color:#00875a}--> i guess it is being cut off due to right tap placement . we can shift it to left but still for right tap placement some portion will be cut off{color}{color:#00875a}!image-2022-11-16-17-14-10-351.png|width=592,height=183!{color}

comment: [~tanmay] - were all the issues fixed per the dpvs provide this morn?
does the new dpvs include all notices or just batch 2??


author: igor.khosid
comment: Hi [~tanmay] [~mousumiS] [~PramaG] [~Najoa] [~andreav]
1. I know it is noticed before; however, I do not see any open bug for that.
Please note - endorsement failing for all DNs
See BT-580
2. Please see BT-581 - 
The top row will be partially cut off when printing, the top section (see attached) needs to be moved down

Here is my testcase. If any confusion, let me know.

comment: Hi [~tanmay] [~mousumiS]Core made content update within print image data file for letter 011 (Both versions) and 026. They added new field DESCRIPTION on both letters data and removed duplicate field AMOUNT field in letter 011 data . Please find mapping update highlighted in red for both the letters. New data file has been copied to dsi_print\mahbuburT\hrtb\data\Latest\HRTB_NSF_111822_1.zip.pgp and dsi_print\mahbuburT\hrtb\data\Latest\HRTB_DN_111822_1.zip.pgp. Mapping document is updated in following folders dsi_print\mahbuburT\hrtb\dn\EP6280P and dsi_print\mahbuburT\hrtb\dn\BP6281P.



Please review and let [~andreav]know when the sample can be provided and/or if you see any issue.

[~Igor.Khosid] this is a last minute change that Bank wants to correct within thier data for the two notices. This change need to be validated once the data file update is programmed and sample is approved.



Thanks
