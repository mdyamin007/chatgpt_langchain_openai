comment: Hi [~dawnl],

[~thomasY]find out that KYCU Loan Bill has return mail remittance in backer. We need new IMB information for new address. Can you please check with Calvin or[~Jessica]for those information?

I think we will need new numbers to replace following information:

('SERVICETYPEIDENTIFIER'='703')
 ('CUSTOMERIDENTIFIER'='901364')
 ('SEQUENCEIDENTIFIER'='886000000')
 ('DELIVERYPOINTZIPCODE'=95051097230)

Thanks,

Tun

comment: Note from client 2/10/2022: Our move has been delayed to April. Please hold off on making any changes to the address on all statements.


author: william.kong
comment: [~dawnl]: Can I get an exact date on when to make this release in April so that we have it planned. Please advise.


author: dawnl
comment: Will - I will check with client on the date.


author: dawnl
comment: Will,

Here is the feedback from client:

"We will move on April 15, although that is not 100% final yet. Any statements generated after that date need to display the new address. I can let you know when the date is final. Will that work?

"

Can you provide the new timeline then?

Thanks.


author: william.kong
comment: [~dawnl]: Agreed, 4/15 live date is good.



[~thomasY]: FYI.

comment: [~dawnl]: Because this project [~thomasY]is working on overlaps with [~Natalie.Tom]'s and [~jira_naru]'s Daily notice project, we need to be very careful on the coordination efforts. Please ensure that this timeline to does not change. Please see if we can get approvals by EOD Monday, 4/11/2022 so that we can do parallel for all 3 applications including Daily Notices between 4/12 to 4/14.



If timeline changes, please escalate and alert me, Tun, Thomas, and Natalie.



I want to make sure we do not have any release issues when multiple projects are occurring at the same time.


author: dawnl
comment: Will - IS-795 this address update needs to go live on 4/15 as scheduled. Natalie, Thomas, Tun and I already had a discussion yesterday. I have informed client they need to approve the sample by eod 4/11. We will do the parallel for IS-795 by itself not with the other two projects.

IS-928 is a in-house change and will go live after IS-795 on04/21/2022

IS-1004 will go live on05/02/2022.
