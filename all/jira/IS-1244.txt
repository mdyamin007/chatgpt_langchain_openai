comment: [~rumanb]Please change letter code from 009 to 109. Please add this change to name of dfa and control files. We made updates for e-statements on this application and had to change the letter codes from 001 - 009 to 101 - 109. These updates will go live 7/15. Also, looks like 109 will be have e-statements so please update dfa to handle e-statements as well, please confirm with [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]. You will need the app type for this letter for e-statements.

Previous data file was bar delimited but recent data file that you provided inside zip file is in xlsx format. Besides, data files header are not same.

!image-2022-08-02-23-08-13-435.png!

Which format should be final can you please confirm it ?

Where should we place the Yellow portion of doc file mapping?

Thanks!


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: Hi [~rumanb]-

1. Final format will be the latest format - xlsx.

2. Please place the yellow portion underneath the URL and the Member FDIC logo.


author: rony
comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]

Are you sure that final data file will be sent in xlsx extension? We never saw data file like this. Would you please talk to [~William.Kong]to confirm. We don't have problem with the format of column and data but client should send the data in delimited format, as per my experience which is mostly csv extension.



[~rumanb]

Thanks

The data file you provided earlier inside zip file, there were *few columns which are missing* in new data file. *Column G (Account number), Column K (To Account)**are absent in the latest csv file*. Can you please provide us a complete data file which will also contain information of those columns too ?

Thanks!


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: Hi [~rumanb]- updated test file attached. Please note...

1. If LetterNumber = 1 then print Student Checking Letter 1. If 2 then print Student Checking Letter 2.

2. If ToAccount = CareFree Checking then print TISA-CareFreeChecking after the 1st page. If ValuePlusChecking then print TISA-ValuePlusChecking after the 1st page.

Please review and let me know if you have any questions. Thanks.

Here is the updated sample[^bkpldn109.pdf]

Thanks!


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~rumanb]- The samples still have the old disclosure. It looks like the 2nd page only after the TISA disclosure. Can you please remove?


author: JIRAUSER10912
comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]

So we should keep just 2nd page as new backer and remove 3rd page as old backer for both of the letter, right ?
 Is it ok now ?[^bkpldn109.pdf]

Thanks!


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~rumanb]- I'm still seeing issues. The backer is ok but I'm seeing verbiage issues. Please see letter for Skylar S Brown, 1202 Oakwood Drive, 1020192140. Her entry in the data file is 1 which means she should have CareFree Checking on her letter. But it says ValuePlus Checking. Please advise.


author: JIRAUSER10912
comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] 

The docs files as mapping for letter 1 and 2 that you provided inside a zip file earlier is something like below,
!confusion.PNG!
In the docs file mapping for letter 2 says that verbiage should be Valueplus checking but according to data file the verbiage should be Carefree checking for letter 2 . So which one should I follow here ? can you please confirm ?

Thanks!


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~rumanb]- Please go off the newest data file. So the 1 in Column I = Letter 1. If it's 2 then = Letter 2. Column K =CareFree Checking then print TISA-CareFreeChecking after the 1st page. If ValuePlusChecking then print TISA-ValuePlusChecking after the 1st page.
