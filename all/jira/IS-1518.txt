sorry for the late update, can you update the code to supress account and warning message with account number when there is a mismatch with the product list. the process should continue though.

lets put this message in the log.

ERROR: <ACCT_NUM> PRODUCT MISMATCH. PLEASE CONTACT IS.

i will add this to the SOW.

comment: [~diegof] [~Andrey.Kutsenko]

I understand that you added logic and I saw it in the DFA file, but how can I check it?

Check the what is the major_code and minor_code for that account. Then if the major+minor code is not in the sncu_product.csv then the message will appear.

For example, for the first account the major code is CNS and minor code is CA02. If you remove the entry "CNS,CA02,Consumer" from the product list then the message will show


author: JIRAUSER11104
comment: QA is completed.
Checked new project with updated dfa file.
Result: A warning message is displayed where the account number does not match the product list.
