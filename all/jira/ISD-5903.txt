title: EWBB - Testing Large Accounts Loading During Enrollment
description: PILOT[
 [https://eastwestbanktest1.bankonline.com/rwd-web/logon]]

CompanyID - stifw

User - testuser1

Password - Test12345!



For Security Questions:

Pet Name - Test1234

First Pay - Test4567

College - Test7890



Unsure about the actual question, but for any given security question, just try all 3 answers, and one of them should work.



eStatement SSO link is under the Accounts tab

Will have to figure out the CIF/VendorUserID, and then link the user with more accounts (up to 300). Accounts linking can be done with CIF file.

May need to manually create a usr_mapping record in order to use the CIF file to link more accounts.

Testing will be done during the initial enrollment steps, particularly Step 3. See if there are slow load times or any other buggy behavior.

If going past step 3, the enrollment steps can be triggered again by changing the usr_session.sso to null.


Try with different browsers also:
Chrome
Firefox
Microsoft Edge

comment: Was able to log in via provided link and credentials.  It would not display account information.  The error message was "You have too many accounts to display at one time".

By pressing REFRESH icon in dashboard, accounts would show up.  There are over 600 accounts.  The information is not up to date.  Looked into a few of these accounts and find that they are not tied to a user.

There are no log activity to suggest that it is communicating with pilot prism default server.
