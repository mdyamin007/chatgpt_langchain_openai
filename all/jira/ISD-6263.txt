title: 25841 - INFO - Email gateway 504 error
description: Based on trial and error, it looks like a variation of restarting ca-api-pr-01/02/03/04 and ca-intproxy-pr-05/06 is necessary to have all email jobs retriggered successfully. Ran into some issues initially where some emails jobs did not run because not all the ca-api-pr servers were restarted.
