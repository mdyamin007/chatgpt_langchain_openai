title: 3211 - GCBK - Both option for paperless status
description: GCBK has requested to test for the both paper and paperless option for their delivery preference. 

When I tried to SSO into an account with the option 'U" for both as their delivery preference, I get stuck on image attached. When I scrolled to the bottom and hit accept, it didn't go into the home page, it just made me go back to the same page for the enrollment. 

Can you update their client code so when the user SSO's with delivery preference of U, it will land them to the home page and they can view statements right away. 

This is a production issue for GCBK internal clients, so can we get this updated by 7/26.
