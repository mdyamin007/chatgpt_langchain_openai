comment: Hi Ethan,



I would just need this live as soon as you are able to move forward. Customer had approved the release, but not sure what is left to complete on your end. Let me know and I can update the bank to verify in production once released right away.



Thanks!
Phoebe

Customer has confirmed that they would like to cancel this request to remove the verbiage. You can close out this ticket, please confirm hours completed.

I'll close the IMPL ticket as well.

Thank you,
