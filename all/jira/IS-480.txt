comment: [~Peter.Dang] this is the 'LN suppression' update, not the DDA. Should this ticket be assigned to DSI instead? There is a separate ticket for the DDA suppression. Thanks!

Hi

*Andy*, Do you have anything to attach I can start the testing?

*Phoebe*, what is the actual due date? Today is already 10.28.2021


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~andyp] can you confirm if this is ready for QA?

[~Igor.Khosid] I will update the due date accordingly once Andy confirms when QA is ready.

comment: Hi [~phoebe.george]

Was this ticket for DSi? We didn't start this yet.
 Please confirm.


author: william.kong
comment: [~anwarh]: I take it that [~andyp] is assigned to this project. [~Peter.Dang]would have caught this being an issue since he as a scrum meeting. I will remove Rony from the IS Upcoming Report sheet and advise [~rony]to remove from the DSi Current Resource sheet.

comment: [~Peter.Dang] [~andyp] Please confirm status of this update. I thought that Andy is working on both DDA and LN, as DDA just currently passed QA.

Thanks!

I was working on ln6 Escrow Statement.

The account volume was quite small in the last few month cycles (cycle 11/30 having only 5 accounts)

I did not see accounts that being matched with suppression condition in data files.

I will try to mock up the data file to have account(s) with suppression condition.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~andyp] thanks for the update!

[~Peter.Dang] please confirm who is assigned to the other LN applications. I have been providing DP with a manual pull list for almost 2 months for these applications and would like to complete through the program as I initiated this back on 10/11!

comment: [~andyp] [~Peter.Dang] [~William.Kong] Please provide an update on this, the due date is passed and need to get this completed for release due to the manual effort we're doing in the meantime. Please provide an update today. Thanks

I found cycle 09/17 had 2 accounts that matched suppression condition. I processed this cycle in parallel.

Please request ISD to post the following index file to pilot.

ln6_20210920_1_20211207_1440_star.txt



I also attached DPVS that showed 2 account in non-estatement.

Note:

The 2 accounts that were being suppressed for estatement as follow

author: phoebe.george
comment: [~andyp] ISD posted successfully to pilot site. I checked the two accounts you provided in the last column, and the eStatement version did not appear in pilot. I checked another account from the same index, and the eStatement was visible. Please confirm next steps to move forward with final testing/code release. Thanks!

 # I believe there are two stories IS-480 and IS654

Would it be possible to update the scope for each of the stories?

IS-480 should be {color:#de350b}DDA{color} and {color:#de350b}MS1{color}; however, it is actual {color:#de350b}LN6{color}

IS-654, my understanding, should be {color:#de350b}LN1{color}, {color:#de350b}LN4{color}, {color:#de350b}LN6{color}?

>>> Please confirm

  2. Also, I noticed the ISD-5958 wondering who provided the index file? I believe Andy ...

{color:#de350b}Please, be sure to provide the index files for both stories for posting on stage.{color}

We can do a quick estatement only parallel.

Please create a parallel ticket.

Thanks


author: william.kong
comment: [~phoebe.george]: What is the status on the parallel? This project due date is way past due 12/20/2021. Please work with [~Peter.Dang]and [~andyp]to re-assess the timeline expectation to ensure we can accurately plan the code release date. Please do not alert us the day of to immediately release this project. We need to set timelines.
