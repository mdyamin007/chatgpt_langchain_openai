in description after verbiage update appears martial status

but pdf and output display: marital status,

What word should be there? marital or martial?

please advise.

Pretty sure it should be 'marital status'.

There is no such thing as 'martial' status, and the before verbiage also had it as 'marital' status. I assume it was a typo on their part.

If anything, for client sample approval we can ask them to confirm that they want 'marital status'.

I confirm it is marital status. I agree with Sam, there is no martial status. 

Thanks, Barnett

Per EWBB, One of my manger notice that there is no letter for these can you check?
ADV504, ADV512, ADV105

Thanks, Barnett

The sample provided earlier did not contain all credit card letters because no single data file contains all of them. After processing multiple data files from several production cycles, I was able to put together a sample that contains all letters. Please note that I haven't been able to find a data file containing a ADV504 letter from 05/12/21 to 08/13/21, so I manually changed one entry in one of the data files to use ADV504.

Here is the sample:[^ewbbcc1_sample_combined.pdf]

Per EWBB, Can you take a look at page 49 and 50. On Page 49 the decline reason is missing. On Page 50 the Your Credit score it should show either a number or Not Available. It is showing something else. 

Are you able to check the data to see if missing data was the cause of this? [^Page 49 and 50.pdf]
