comment: [~barnetts] [~eric.yan] do we have the letter code/description for this yet?


author: eric.yan
comment: [~barnetts]

The sample is ready for review.

[~Shun.Kuwashima]

Letter code is 018


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: Thanks [~eric.yan]
[~barnetts], I suppose the enotice description will be Courtesy Pay Notice based on comment 5 on TS 21875. Is that correct?


author: barnetts
comment: Hi [~Shun.Kuwashima],

That is correct. Please refer to comment # 5 for description. Please let me know if you have questions.

Thanks, Barnett 


author: barnetts
comment: Hi [~eric.yan],

Samples have been sent for UTCU approval.

Thanks, Barnett


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: Thanks [~barnetts], I've added the letter code/description to pilot.


author: barnetts
comment: Thank you [~Shun.Kuwashima]


author: barnetts
comment: Hi [~Shun.Kuwashima],

Please see UTCU feedback below: [^cpaymargin.docx] 
The right margin is extended out past the original document I had sent over.  Can we get that margin pulled back from the right a bit?

Thanks, Barnett 


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~barnetts], I think that's a question for Eric/IS. On ISD's end we just add the enotice code/description to the site, we don't control how the actual document looks like.

I think the other letter has similar issue that UTCU doesn't creat new account for new account numbers. Shun, could you please confirm?

The other Jira is ISD-4846


author: shun.kuwashima

Account creation should be enabled now on stage, can you undo and repost the file?
