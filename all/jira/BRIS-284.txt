title: ca-isis-dv-01:  Port 80 access to ca-preproc-pr-03
description: [~premraj.patil]:  Apparently on ca-isis-dv-01, i need to access port 80 on ca-preproc-pr-03.



[root@rht ~]# echo > /dev/tcp/10.4.20.23/80 && echo "Port is open"
-bash: connect: Connection timed out



Can you open port 80 access?
