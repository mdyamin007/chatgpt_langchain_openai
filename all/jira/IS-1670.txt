title: SURU Electricity Stmt Fix
description: SURU Electricity Stmt Fix



Before the update of https://jira.infoimageinc.com/browse/IS-1590,

We had separate logic place to process "_stmt_Daily_" files.

After that update it became redundant and causing this issue.



We need to remove this logic from the processing script.
