title: HCCU - Invoice - VisaPDFi Conversion to AFP2PDF Python [InHse]
description: Update existing processing script to no longer use PDFi tool to create pdf.
 Instead use afp2pdf.py program with index_build_multicore option for ALL statement related apps.
 The smaller daily notice jobs can use the current index_build options.

All the zip file, pgp encryption, index file contents, and PDF file naming convention must remain exactly the same original specifications.

Please ensure the standard SOP on the directory structure must be followed: 
 ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/pdf, ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/zip, ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/work is followed.
 Also, clear the folder directory folder before each processing. We do NOT want to accumulate previous runs.

The current program should support checking total PDF counts verification to make sure the expected pdf matches the total number for pdfs generated; If not, incorporate this standard verification logic

DT_JOB_ID:
 133568-C00.01-V20985

Processing Scripts to modify:
 hccumv1_process.sh

Data Files to use:
 HCCU_RSTATVSA_042621.pgp



*NOTE*: This job runs on RH2 server. Since we are migrating from RH2 server to RHS, please test ALL job_sel options to ensure RHS can run with error messages in the processing log files.

[~Igor.Khosid]: I ran pdf_compare.pl yesterday and there were no issues. I did have to increase the tolerance level from 5 to 14 which is rather high. This is primarily because of the message graphics. If want me to lower pixel lower to see the difference, please let me know.

comment: [~rony]: Please also run this on RHS server with 's' option so that we can run afpcompare to test. Once done, we will compare your recent parallel run proc_id from /z/afpformat folder with the /d/afpformat folder version. Please let me know so I can analyze. If there are any error messages with logs, please report them.
