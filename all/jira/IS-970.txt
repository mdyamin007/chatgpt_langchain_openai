title: SUCU - eCredit Card Processing Script Update for Un-zipping files
description: Permanent update to the processing script to unzip an inside file as well for processing. Here is how the files will be arriving moving forward - please confirm hours and timing needed to update the processing script to eliminate any further manual packaging of files:

Outer zipped file: sucu_cc_mmddyy_1.zip 

The outer zipped file will then be encrypted with PGP and will look like this:

    Outer zipped PGP file: sucu_cc_mmddyy_1.zip.pgp

Inside the zipped and encrypted file will be:

    CardStatements_mmddyy.zip
    CardStatemenIndexmmddyy.txt

From SUCU: When I download the files from Coop I get the .txt file and all the PDFs are in a zipped file.  I dont plan on unzipping that zip file.
