title: FNBK - [27996][pvt][in-house] Error file
description: Turnover Date : 04/22/2022
Sample to QA Date: 04/25/2022
Go live date: 04/27/2022

Parallel required: No



The invalid account list was generated in May 1,2021. After that for every cycle the same file is being copied, encrypted and kept in client pickup. I think we need to update the processing script to prevent it from copying older report file for new data files.

comment: Changed the naming pattern of invalid account report generated from DFA from <prefix>_invalid_account.txt to<prefix>_invalid_account_<procdate(mmddyyyy)>.txt, so that processing script do not copy the older report for new data file.
