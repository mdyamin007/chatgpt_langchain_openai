 # The "1" came from field 28 from data file. If it's wrong value then customer need to fix data file or provide correct mapping.
 # The date field is placed in similar as the samples sent from customer. I think should be ok to place there.


author: gthillaivel
comment: [~Bryanl]-Can you confirm what needs to be displayed for the item 

1. The "1" came from field 28 from data file. If it's wrong value then customer need to fix data file or provide correct mapping.

Do you like to fix the date in correct place?
2.The date field is placed in similar as the samples sent from customer

I have asked for an update from the client, thanks!


author: bryanl
comment: [~gthillaivel] [~jun]

Attached is an updated test file from client "II.CBRNOTICE.03162022". Client noted they will pass the actual data in Field 28 instead of a numeric value.

Client also confirmed the Date Field does go in front of the verbiage 'Date'. Thank you!

The template/markup has the source on top. I don't need we need to move it down.

Item 2 and 3 are data file issue.

comment: [~jun] [~gthillaivel]

Client says for the source information showing above it instead of the space to the right, "the data one fit in that small space."

They also noted "We are using a pipe to separate the Source Address and Phone Number -

Example: Experian - PO Box 2002 Allen Tx 75013 | (888) 397-3742

I will get with our development team to change that to a dash (-) and it should fix issues listed in 2 & 3."



Thank you!

comment: [~Bryanl]: Per [~jun]a new test file is required in order to acomplish the changes above. This means timeline is no longer valid. Please advise when we can get a replace test file.

comment: Hi [~Bryanl],

This project is holding for a while. 

I will remove from developer resource list, if we don't have any action within one week from now.

Developer will not reinitiate project until we setup new timeline.

Please let me or Peter know if we need to restart the project.

comment: Hi [~Bryanl],

Just FYI. I removed from resource schedule. We can just leave as "hold" for this Story.

But we will need new timeline when client wants to resume this project.
Because the developer may busy with other projects.

Please let [~Peter.Dang] or me know when client wants to resume project.
Thanks

author: jessica
comment: [~jun]Per client: The samples look good; however, I have a question on the return PDF File. When we receive the return files can we exclude Page 1? If we can exclude Page 1 then we approve the samples. If we can NOT exclude Page 1 in the retrun PDF File then we need to add the Encrypted Account Number and Application ID to Page 1.


author: jun
comment: [~Jessica]What is the return pdf file? Do they mean this letter? The first page is required because the content of the second page would conflict with the first page (logo + return address).

Attached is pdf sample with the encrypted acct # and app id added.

comment: [~jun]Archival file.

comment: [~Jessica]

Attached archival samples.

[^dl1_07122022_1_tkcu.zip]


author: jessica
comment: [~jun] The first page of the letter needs to be removed in archival. Also customer wants to test the print flag. Can I request the file be posted to pilot?


author: jun
comment: [~Jessica]

Removing first page from the PDF archival isn't feasible to do. The letter would have to look the same for print, enotice and archival.

Please provide DT job id in Pilot for samples.


author: jessica
comment: [~jun] Per client:



If we can NOT exclude Page 1 in the retrun PDF File then we need to add the Encrypted Account Number and Application ID to Page 1. for archival only



Please provide new samples for archival.


author: jun
comment: [~Jessica]

Please see the attachment "[^dl1_07122022_1_tkcu.zip]". This zip should contain the archival with the encrypted acct # and app id.

Also, it's not feasible to put this verbiage on archival only. The verbiage would have to show on all the outputs (print, enotice, archival).


author: jessica
comment: [~jun] It does not have to be archival only. I have attached samples to show what I mean. We need to add the Notice Date (Field 6) to Page One so that our Imaging process will file the PDF correctly. We don't need the text file. 

Can you confirm if the text file is already part of the archival? See attached samples for customer mockups

comment: [~jun] [~Jessica]

Jun, client responded to the sample (I have attached the samples client sent):

There may have been a miscommunication in what I was asking. It does not have to be archival only. I have attached samples to show what I mean. We need to add the Notice Date (Field 6) to Page One so that our Imaging process will file the PDF correctly. We don't need the text file.


author: jun
comment: [~billr] [~Jessica]

The latest samples i've attached have the updated notice date to page one.

The "TKCU_index_<mmddyyyy>.txt" is part of the archival.

Thanks Jun, will follow up with the client.

Following up with the client for sample approval.

comment: [~jun] [~TunA] [~Jessica]

TKCU has asked to put this ticket on hold - see their response to the sample below:

"The samples are approved; however, I cannot approve at this time. There are some things on our end that need to be fixed and we have put this project on hold for the time being as we work on other InfoIMAGE projects."

comment: Hi [~billr],

Thanks for letting us know.

I removed from resource schedule. We can just leave as "hold" for this Story. But we will need new timeline when client wants to resume this project. Because [~jun] may busy with other projects.
