title: MVCU - [32904][pvt][in-house] August Message Manager
description: define ACN before calling the message manager module.


author: rony
comment: Hi [~gthillaivel]

This is a production issue. The message manager was not working on the account number. That's because the necessary variable ACN should be declared before the message manager function gets called, but initially, it was declared after.

dev id: 20220911204809 (not parallel, parallel has another update going on)

MVCUMS31.zip is in qa folder.



This is how I tested the update:

this is the portal file. it will display pseg S1176583.300 if account no is in &ACCOUNTNUMBEER11 array which comes from ms3_AccountNumber_11.txt file.

!image-2022-09-12-10-03-56-530.png|width=755,height=204!



in ms3_AccountNumber_11.txt file used this account no:

!image-2022-09-12-10-05-35-863.png!



which is the account no of the customer in papyrus:

and the message S1176583.300 is appearing:
