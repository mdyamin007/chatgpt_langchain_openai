So far our QA find the following issue and we need your feedback on this.

* click on Disclosure button. There is no drop down and adobe link. Should we add adobe link in footer

!Disclosure_menu.png|width=1920,height=937!

* click on Enrollment Disclosure. Here all the verbiage written in UCCU instead of UTCU. Can you confirm us about this.



!Enrollment_Disclosure_stmt.png|width=1920,height=1018!

* change drop down of View Disclosure for Statements-->eNotice. I think this is in appropriate verbiage. What should we do about this
