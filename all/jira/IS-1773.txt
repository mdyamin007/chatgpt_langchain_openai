Need to add field 6 from 520 record with field 4 per comment 3.

Per comment 3 need to addCard #(520, field 6)

in dfa case 520 statement add 6 to FIELDS_NO value and addCard #(520, field 6) to description:





-----------------------Comment #3 TS 34608--------------------------------

Here is an example of where we would like to include the last four of the card number. This information is in the data file currently. 520, field 06 contains the card number.

We would want this to show as "Card #(520, field 6)"

Also, I noticed in the SOW that we have some old email addresses listed. We would want to remove DWilson@redwoodcu.org, JBliss@redwoodcu.org, Jungewitter@redwoodcu.org and add DRADepartment@redwoodcu.org.
