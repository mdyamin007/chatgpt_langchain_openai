title: MFCU - Set Up Return Mail Processing
description: Create new global processing programming for Return Mail Processing that leverages USPS Return Mail Services instead of the current InfoIMAGE Return Mail Services.

IS Dept will need to update one of the 40 global print modules to support IMB bar code in the first class mail 5.2oz, 5.hvy, 5.pm1 - 5pm5 and 5.sm1 - 5.sm5.
 Also, we need to introduce a new Mailer Service ID value for IS to use in the global programming for include the USPS Mailer Service ID value. The service code is 522 {color:#de350b}(i.e. ESR1){color}
 We will need to work with ISD team to do some coding (still TBD) as to how to retrieve the USPS data.
 We will need to work with OPS on how to parse the USPS Return Mail data that they download manually to us.

In addition, the print module will need to handle the following:

If ServiceType is ESR1 we will hardcode our print module programming to use ELECTRONIC SERVICE REQUESTED as the endorsement for any mail pieces with IMB.

If it does +not+ have IMB, please use the normal endorsement if it is defined; In the case of MFCU, their business rule is to use RETURN SERVICE REQUESTED. If the control file does not have the endorsement define, please let it blank.

I am about to release the print modules to production.

However, I notice in production database, IMB_TRAC table, the type value is not correct for MFCU.

It is ASE3 and notESR1.

Please advise.
