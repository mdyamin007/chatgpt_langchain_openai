title: SACU - [31246] [pvt] Daily Notice Fix for Delinquent Notice Files
description: Permanent change to modify script to check to see if there are any 2nd or 1st Delinquent letters within the Delinquent file AND then create the .dat files accordingly. This will prevent the program from failing each time the customer sends a Delinquent file that contains only one type of Delinquent letter (1st or 2nd).

Update logic letters 6 and 7 (Overdrawn Letters) as well (as it currently follows the same logic).

NOTE: Based on error message tied to ticket #31246: This failure is due to the logic in the script. The script arbitrarily looks for the Delinquent file and creates two .dat files, one for letter 2 and one for letter 3. These .dat files are then fed into Papyrus for formatting. Since there were no 2nd Delinquent letters, the formatting step produced an empty txt and the process failed.

Start date is 8/8/22
Live date is 8/10/22

comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid],

Please start QA on this.

No changes are done in dfa. So no need to upload project files in QA folder.

Changes are done only in processing script.

Print range: 1-22

I ran the process using the data fileSACU_dn_080722_1.zip.pgp

According to SOW the zip may contain Delinquent_<MMDDYY>_<seg#>.txt andDelinquent data file can contain 2 types of letter data (letter 002 and letter 003).

In production the process was failing if the "Delinquent" data file has only one type of letter info (002).

Updated script is in parallel with the fixes of above issue.

Same scenario need to be tested for "Negative" data that contains 006 and 007 letter data.

Let me know if anything more needed.

Thanks
