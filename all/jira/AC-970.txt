description: Transfer all 023 and 024 letters to the DD Account Type. Including the list/accounts attached in Shun's comment 30.

From researching, I found the following:

- None of the 023 and 024 letters have been viewed yet from a customer standpoint.

- There are no users tied to any account type 99 that has a letter 023 or letter 024.



It's likely these are admin-only accounts based on the above, therefore we might not need to worry about other customers seeing other customer's notices, which is one less thing to worry about.



Of the type 99 account numbers with letters 023 and 024, most of them only have a DD type in addition to 99, so I'm assuming we can just transfer those from 99 to DD? However there are 9 accounts which have*both type DD and SV*other than type 99 so we need to know which account type to move it to. Here is the list:



19070836718
709386
3080352898
3080432116
185918
2584415
3070855932
3080399262
6080347774



If we can sort out the above, then I think we can transfer statements over with a script, therefore not needing to reprocess/repost. For reference, here is a total list of accounts with type 99 and has letters 023 or 024.

comment: [~dyuen] Just to be safe, once the IS update is rolled out onto production can you reconfirm that we can transfer these letters 023/024 based on the following:
* If an account has only one other existing type, then we transfer it to that type (i.e. If acct 123 has a type 99 and SV, we move it to SV).
* If an account has more than one other existing type, we transfer it to DD (i.e. if acct 123 has a type 99, DD, and SV, we move it to DD).

comment: Hi [~Shun.Kuwashima], please see following from GCBK comments 39 and 40 from the ticket:

"Hello!

Even though we just spoke, I figured I'd still respond so you have it in the ticket for reference if needed.

For both letters -

If an Account on the arch_ref file has CK > Map to DD
 If an Account on the arch_ref file has SAV > Map to SV

I believe the 99 comes in when you can't find the account number on the arch-ref file, so those would be handled how you do any others today when this occurs.

Thanks! Candace"

"Or I guess I didn't ask, for those that had a 99, if they later were on the file so following letters identified the account as SV or DD, if you can then transfer it to the correct type that would be great. Maybe that question was for the going back to post these after the fact. "
