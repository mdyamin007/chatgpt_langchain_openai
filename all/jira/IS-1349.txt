I was able to see new logo in NSF Notice (index file[^fhnb_afp_enotice_08252022_084248_1.txt])

Kindly compare the old logo:
 !Old Logo.png!

And the new logo:
 !New Logo.png!

The new logo is suffering from a bad case of JPEG artifacts. In the old logo, I can see none.
 The client gave us a lossless image, so I suppose the artifacts are the result of how we processed it.
 I don't know our software capabilities, but I strongly suggest lossless compression for images with limited number of colors.
 The old logo proves we can do better than now.


author: JIRAUSER11700
comment: Current index file processing status:

fhnb_afp_enotice_08112022_090315_1.txt - the old logo is visible

fhnb_afp_enotice_08252022_074856_1.txt - success, the new logo is visible

fhnb_afp_enotice_08252022_084248_1.txt - success, the new logo is visible

Issue: only either 08252022_074856 or08252022_084248 can be processed at the same time: "the data file has been processed before".

Migration to Staging is underway, will need to repeat once it is over.
 [~Shun.Kuwashima], please let me know when it's complete  thanks!

comment: [~jasonV] For fhnb_afp_enotice_08112022_090315_1.txt, is there perhaps another resource file I need to upload? Below are the ones I have uploaded so far:

S1FHNBL3.300
S1FCSBS1.300
S1FCSBS2.300
S1FCSBL2.300

For fhnb_afp_enotice_08252022_074856_1.txt, the process failed because dtjobid seems to be missing from IS database. Can you look into this?

[~avannik] I'm still waiting on a new sample enrollment pdf from IS before I can move all my updates to stage, I will let you know asap once completed.




author: JIRAUSER11003
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] my applications only use

S1FCSBS1.300
S1FCSBS2.300

I may need to reprocess for the changes to go through?




author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~jasonV] Actually I noticed that the last 4 accounts in this index file fhnb_afp_enotice_08112022_090315_1.txt has the new logo while most seem to have the old one. Is that expected? Below are some accounts for both cases:

New:
5172820010854000
5172820010965095
5172820010371880

Old:

DLA has 11 different letters, as far as I can see. Only one type is present in the index file,
[~jasonV], if you can provide a representative selection, that would be great.
