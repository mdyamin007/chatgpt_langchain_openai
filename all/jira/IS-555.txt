comment: Hi Leo,

Can you check again?  Client said that the file test/DACB_image_10202021.ICL.pgp should have 49 total check images in it.  

Here is the feedback from client:

"
The file should have 49 total check images in it.  When I open the file here I can view them all and I can even see the totals record that you have previously said was missing.  Do you know why I can view them ok but not on your side?  In fact all of the files we have sent I am able to view everything fine.  Do you know what the other vendor might have to do differently in the file so you can read it?  We really need to get this working on your end because it is something that will prevent us from going Live with the other vendor.  Dec 6th is our current go live date with them.  Any info you can provide will be helpful.

Since client has gone live with file and there seems to be NO issue, I will close out this JIRA
