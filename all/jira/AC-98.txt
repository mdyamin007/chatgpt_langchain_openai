create duplex insert starting on a new page, (add a blank page to the back of page if statement ends on front page).



The word doc and PDF are not the same. Which is the actual insert? Will need client to provide a finalized insert whether it is the PDF or word version on comment 1, (prefers PDF format).



The PDFis a bit blurry, once we convert it will be even more blurry. We will need a clearer PDF. If it is the word doc, prefers client to provide one without the highlights.
