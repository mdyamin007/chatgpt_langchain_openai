comment: [~glenn.grimes]: Can you share the script you used to process this program? My team was supposed to update the script to no longer use the name 'Iswk4'.


author: william.kong
comment: [~glenn.grimes]: Nevermind. The script name is/home/test/master/iswk_client3.pl



[~Peter.Dang]: Can you get this fixed? Please update script to use

ca-rtitan-pr-04 instead of Iswk4.

comment: Code is released. Closing this out.


author: william.kong
comment: This is still pending Peter to release the code to Brisbane tomorrow morning.



[~Peter.Dang]: can you also assign this ticket to Glen after you manually release code to brisbane so that he can retest to confirm that it works.






author: william.kong
comment: [~glenn.grimes]: Peter forgot to update this ticket. He's released the code. Please retest.



[~Peter.Dang]: FYI.


author: william.kong
comment: [~glenn.grimes]: Hi Glen, do you have any update on this ticket?




author: glenn.grimes
comment: [~William.Kong] [~Peter.Dang] Sorry, I tried this a couple of days back and was getting the same error... I could have sworn I added a comment and assigned back to Peter? Anyway, I just tried to process again and I am still getting the following error:

comment: [~glenn.grimes]: Thanks for the update. For some reason the parallel code does was not updated. I thought my team got this updated along with production last week.  Production code is updated, but not in parallel.  I+temporarily+ modify the brisbane code. Can you retest quickly before which switch license from RHS to RHS2 today. Thanks!





[~Peter.Dang]: Why is parallel code not updated, please advise. I+temporarily+ modified the Brisbane Parallel code.

author: william.kong
comment: [~Peter.Dang]: There are two issues. Please review the comment above from Glen and the prior comment from me for the 2nd issue that needs to be fixed.


author: william.kong
comment: [~Peter.Dang]: Per our conversation, you are addressing the iswk_clien3.pl code issue.



[~thomasY]: Per Terrence, can you help research the from Glenn's comment above.


author: thomasy
comment: [~glenn.grimes] [~William.Kong]I was able to run the process to completion with the only error being the lack of a papyrus key.


author: william.kong
comment: [~thomasY]: Thanks for assisting so quickly. Then i'm not sure why Glenn ran into the issue earlier. Since RHS key is not active, I'm going to put this into the backlog and assign it to me for now.

comment: [~thomasY]:  Can you please review this?


author: thomasy
comment: [~glenn.grimes] Please try again. Some files were not synced up.


author: glenn.grimes
comment: [~thomasY] I have reprocessed, everything looks good; however, there were a couple of DPVS errors. I believe I might have added actual job numbers into the insert, so that explains the first error and it is likely ignoreable; however, before I pass I just wanted to make sure the second error is ignoreable as well.

Error function get_app_no data is missing: app_no = 99999, app_version = 9999999, app_desc = no desc, Bad file descriptor

Error: Missing incoming data files. Please ensure to call get_md5_sum.sh to popluate incoming file in /home/test/master/dpvs_rpt.pl


author: thomasy
comment: [~glenn.grimes] DPVS error is fine. This happens currently as well.


author: glenn.grimes
comment: [~William.Kong] Since both errors appear to be ignorable, I will go ahead and pass this on the smartsheet.



Thank you.


author: william.kong
comment: [~glenn.grimes]: Thanks! I will close this ticket out then.
