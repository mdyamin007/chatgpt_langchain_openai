title: Redmine:  Proxy Request
description: [~premraj.patil]:



Per our meeting today, please setup a proxy server to route [https://track.infoimageinc.com|https://track.infoimageinc.com/]to the ca-redmine-pr-01 port 80.



Per Kent's suggestion, please use ISD internal proxy to setup the routing.



Thanks!

comment: [~premraj.patil] and [~kent.chan]: Any status on getting the Redmine Proxy setup? I really need this done before Saturday, 11/21/2020.



Please advise.
