comment: [~rumanb] [~mousumiS] The posted version for the following notices are formatting incorrectly (not displaying correctly like the approved samples). Below is an example for notice 014 for the posted version, but several of them appear this way: 014, 021, 026, 027, 028, 029, 030, 033, 036- I confirmed that ISD loaded all resources. Can you check as soon as possible? Thanks!

comment: [~Najoa] [~mousumiS] [~PramaG]
As discussed in today's meeting, please proceed with the testing - with whatever is ready

[~Najoa] - I'm assigning the story to you. Please split it with [~mousumiS] and [~PramaG]
[~rumanb]
Please let us know of any updates. I noticed there is a missing procs file in the PR report.

[~phoebe.george] - FYI


author: JIRAUSER10907
comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid]

Yes already split it between QAs

Sumi is doing test for letter 001-014

Prama- letter 015-027

Najoa - 028 -041



Hi [~phoebe.george], [~rumanb] based on yesterdays meeting we are keeping the code for letter 040 in script(which needs to be update) but as there will be no data for it, it will not cause any issue.
