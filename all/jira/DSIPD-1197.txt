title: Job status filter update
description: 1. For all tab, filter by should honor the overall status (Ex: Done should not show any group of jobs where pJob is done but eJob has not, it should fetch only those group of jobs where both status is Done)

2. While filtering with 'Done' status, jobs with 'Early' and 'Late' status should be included as well.
