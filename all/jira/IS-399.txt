comment: Hi [~rony]and [~anwarh],

I see following William's note in Upcoming project list. The job did not assign yet. Could you please assign, and discuss sample date/live date with Phoebe?

Thanks,

Tun



@rony.das@dsinnovators.com @anwar.hossain@dsinnovators.com : Client paused the SUCU Phase I eStatement project because they want our statement print output design logic to match up with their existing eStatement vendor. Tanmay is helping to analyze the effort match the document output logic with their existing eStatement vendor output. I'm hoping after we quote this job, that we can target 9/30/2021 so that we can have the other SUCU Phase I project released on this same day. Please discuss with Tanmay and see if 9/30 is possible. If not, then we will have to advise client to be 10/31 instead.

comment: [~tanmay] I'll update this on the descriptions as well.
 * SUCU does not have a maximum number of product types that a statement can contain. Please determine how best to handle if more product types that will fit on page 1. Note that this is definitely not a likely scenario that may ever happen (as it would be equivalent to 80+ products on one statement, but because SUCU does not have a maximum number, please confirm how best to handle.
 * Here are the product codes that fall under "Deposit": CK (checking), SAV (savings), TD (Certificates/IRA)
 * Here are the product codes that fall under "Loans": CML Loans, CNS Loans, MTG Loans
 * Reference attached for list of products.

comment: ^Additional Updates as of 9/24/21 requested by CU; attaching revised preprint and changes for reference:^

1. Customer would like to remove this bottom Marketing Message box; this will impact message manager as well so please factor into the programming hours.

2. Based on removing the message box, can the product extend the width of the box, and shrink the background box dynamically?

3. Align statement transaction/sections with the left edge of the Account Summary box OR shorten the width of the Account Summary box to mirror existing margin for transactions.

4. Decrease height of black line to about 1/4 the size; it display too thick currently.

comment: [~tanmay] per our Skype message, PDF samples provided on 10/12/21.

Additional requested change noted below - can you confirm updated sample date? Added this to Epic description as well:

Additional Update request as of 10/14/21 based on latest sample review:

1. Center product types listed in the Account Summary Box, rather than left aligned. This will mainly be reflected when there is only 1 product type.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~tanmay] samples are approved!

Please let me know if you can provide an updated index file to post to the pilot site with these changes. Thank you!

author: phoebe.george
comment: [~tanmay] sorry for the delay with an update, the samples you provided were approved, but the IS on-shore team has to create the e-form associated with the update. 

This was just assigned to IS/Eric for now. Their sample date is 12/9 for an overall live date of 12/20. Thanks!


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~tanmay] Eric (on-shore) finished the updates to the e-form. Can you confirm if your current programming updates are in parallel environment so he can sync his changes with it?

[~eric.yan] FYI for DSI confirmation.


author: eric.yan
comment: hi [~tanmay]

I've updated the e-form and preview the output in parallel. But there are two issue:

1) a red box in the middle of the page and it's from the print file in parallel.

2) the black bar is blocking text partially

No I didn't run the process. I just used the latest print file in parallel environment. It's dated 10/29. Is that generated from your earlier test run?

we have uploaded the resource at parallel. we reran the process. Regarding two issues:  
1. Previously there was two message manager, but in new updates client want to discard the second one. so i tested disabling the 2nd message manager, but meanwhile William had to enable 2nd message manager forreleasing the extended mail tracking. However we again disabled then 2nd msg manager.
2. We dont see any overlapping issue on the sample. A estatement sample has been attached please check.


author: eric.yan
comment: [~tanmay]

Thanks for the update. I check both the estatment and print sample, and there's a discrepancy of the bar width (see screenshot). Could you update the print parameters to match the estatment option?

author: phoebe.george
comment: [~eric.yan] [~tanmay] Just wanted to check if a new DPVS should be created based on the recent updates. Let me know if this can be provided for printing tomorrow. 

Also, please confirm if an eStatement index file can be generated to post to pilot so SUCU can review the changes via pilot site. Thank you!




author: tanmay
comment: yes [~phoebe.george]will will provide dpvs once [~eric.yan]finished his job.

Thanks for checking, the discrepancy comes from my local resources. Please go ahead to generate DPVS and estatement index for [~phoebe.george] .

comment: [~phoebe.george]forget to mention , please ask isd team to use transparent option for eposting.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~tanmay] ISD updated this option, but the Account Summary background color is still not displaying. Can you check this, we need final approval today from SUCU in order to stay on schedule. Thank you!


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~tanmay] [~rony] I know that we are still trying to resolve the e-stmt posting issue, but wanted to let you know that the PRINT samples have been approved (I had hard copy samples printed and shipped to customer). 

As soon as the eStmt portion is resolved, we can move forward with initiating final QA.

[~Igor.Khosid] [~eric.yan] - FYI for now.

Thank you!

[~eric.yan]/[~tanmay]/[~Shun.Kuwashima]: Still pending [~phoebe.george]'s confirmation of live date.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~William.Kong] I have not advised on this yet due to some other factors tied to pre-ingestion processing (that uses the same code) that I have not yet confirmed. I need to wait until Neil gets back on Monday to confirm and then will advise. I'm not sure if we will be completing code release before this EOM or after EOM since I just found that we did not retain the monthly statement files as originally requested at the start of this implementation project. I will provide an update Monday or Tuesday at latest. In the meantime, we are working through completing the parallel test. I'll provide instructions to all impacted departments by 12/28, EOD on how we will proceed once I confirm and update the customer.

Once I get the green light, I will discuss with Terrence for your portion....
