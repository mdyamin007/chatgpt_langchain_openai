UCCU wants a selective message on the bottom of their statements for their statements. It will be for Print and Electronic.

Selective account list is attached to this ticket. It will be for this upcoming month end (7/31 - 8/1)



The selective message is listed below.

Effective immediately, your new daily debit card spending limits are:

 ATM cash withdrawals: $1,010
 Debit card purchases with PIN: $3,500
 Signature purchases (select credit as the purchase type with your debit card when shopping in-person, or just shop as you normally would online): $7,500

If your card is lost or stolen, contact us immediately at 503-227-5571. If its after hours, call 503-423-8315 or 1-800-422-3132 (option 2) to report it. The important thing is to act fast. Once you report the loss of your card, you won't be held liable for unauthorized charges made afterward.

Tip: To stop fraud in its tracks, turn your card off/on instantly with the Unitus Card Guard mobile app; available on the App Store and Google Play Store.

Your Unitus Visa debit card comes with 24/7 fraud monitoring and Zero Liability protection from Visa, so you wont be held responsible for unauthorized card transactions.
