comment: Hi [~Sheikh_Fahim]

Per client:

The content of Privacy Policy insert is all okay. However, we were wondering about the spacing on the bottom portion of the insert. Can this be adjusted just a bit?

1.Member's Address, the lines aren't evenly spaced (MFCU28357Change1.png)

2.The bar code under the account Number, seems smashed together (MFCU28357Change2.png)


author: JIRAUSER11500
comment: Hi [~Bryanl]

The spacing issues has been fixed in the new samples attached below

author: dyuen
comment: [~Sheikh_Fahim], looks like they have an issue with spacing in the box now. Can you take a look?



Per MFCU:

Marketing has asked about the spacing of the 3 line items within the box in the bottom left corner.

They are asking if a little bit of space can be put in between each of the 3 line items. Right now the sentences seem crammed together. 

Looks like you shouldn't have to increase the size of the box to add a little space b/w the sentences.

Also, they are asking if you can double check... but it almost looks like line# 3 might be in a larger font. Is it? The 3 line items should all have the same font & font size.

Note: Adjustment may need to be made to the barcode.

comment: Hi [~Peter.Dang] [~rony] [~Sheikh_Fahim] , I spoke with MFCU and they're looking to us for a recommendation on which barcode to use; code 39 or 128. Is it possible to provide a sample back for both barcodes just so that MFCU can compare? If there really is no difference since their account numbers are only numbers, please advise which code we will use. And provide an updated sample using the recommended barcode.

author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~Sheikh_Fahim]. I checked with Peter. Please use code 128 under the account number field in the bottom portion of the letter.

I have used code 128 for bar code and the new sample is attached below

comment: [~berezinez], FYI, I sent the updated sample to MFCU for a simultaneous QA/client review.

Thanks


author: dyuen
comment: [~Sheikh_Fahim], please see feedback from client:



We've tested the barcode, it does pull up the correct information. However, the barcode itself is difficult for our reader to pick up.

We think it needs a little more space around it and a larger size. I found out that our current system is set to read barcodes at 0.5 inch in Height. However, they think they can adjust to it being a little smaller than that, because I don't think that would fit on the form.*Can you find out what the current height of the barcode is set to?*

I've mocked up a new alignment on the bar code. It's a suggestion of moving the spacing to align with the last line of the address & increase in size. Let me know what your team thinks. Pls see attached.

!image-2022-09-15-16-34-40-103.png!



Can you adjust the barcode according to their specs/mockup?

Thanks


author: JIRAUSER11500
comment: Hi [~dyuen]

The current height of the bar code is 0.12

!Height_barcode.PNG|width=587,height=259!

which size should we use for the new height?

Thanks


author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~Sheikh_Fahim], can try .3 or if its too large try .25?

Thanks


author: JIRAUSER11500
comment: Hi [~dyuen]

I am providing the both samples with 0.30 and 0.25 down below

Height 0.30 Sample:[^MFCUMS11_with_height_0.30.pdf]

Let me knw which one the client approves.

Thanks


author: dyuen
comment: Thanks [~Sheikh_Fahim]for the quick turnaround!

I have forwarded both samples. Pending their response.


author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~Sheikh_Fahim], the height is still too short.

Can you make the barcode taller in height to fill in the blue space as shown in the screenshot below?

comment: Hi [~berezinez], my apologies. I should have made a note. The "Summary of Key Changes"/Change of Terms should be there/is correct. MFCU will have 2 in-line inserts for this coming month end. One for the global Change of Terms insert (IS-1458) and one for the selective Privacy Policy insert (this jira). The order in the print samples is also correct. MFCU wanted the Change of Terms insert to display before the Privacy Policy insert.



I will initiate parallel. [~misbah.uddin@dsinnovators.com] [~Sheikh_Fahim], should we use 1 parallel ticket for this test?
