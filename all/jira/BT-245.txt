comment: [~gthillaivel] Thank you, this is what was already noted since last production cycle. Reviewed with Ron/TXOPS, and we are okay to release as is, as the address will show when tapped to the top. We will work with CU to update/correct for 9/30 production, but TXOPS is aware that they will be released this way due to the 'Making life better' tagline" and the previous 3 production cycles already released this way.

Thanks,

Phoebe
