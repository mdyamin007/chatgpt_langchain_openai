We are having issues running the script in rht. It's been stuck at this point.

Would you please advise here. If you want to run it below are the commands:

_rm $home_master/keep/cksum_log/mfcuea1_cksum.log_
_rm $d_dir/ftpbu/mfcubu/*_
_cp /z/download/mfcu/mfcu_EscrowAnalysisStatement_05032022_1.zip.pgp $d_dir/ftpbu/mfcubu/_
_sh -x $home_master/master/redtitan_stmt_process.sh mfcuea1 1 bypass n_

Thanks

I tried to run the script in pilot but got an error that's why peter suggested me to run in stage. Now stage is ready. Please check it.

and the *dt_job_id* is*133475-C03.01-V22696*
I set only advanced online proofing not sample proof file and Divert mail process as mentioned in ticket.

Thanks!

The client does not have access to staging, only pilot. How can they give approval if it is not posted on pilot?

Since client cannot test in pilot, will we just release to production?
