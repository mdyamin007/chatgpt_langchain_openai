comment: Hi [~dyuen]

Any feedback?


author: dyuen
comment: [~rony], my mistake. I think I missed sending the sample when I was working on sending the other archival samples. I just notified RWCU. Pending response.


author: dyuen
comment: [~rony], RWCU's response:the word 'WITHHOLDING' is misspelled. The XML has it as 'WITHOLDING'

Please correct and provide a new sample.

The archival sample is/d/infoftps3/Vend_DSI/client_pickup/print_process/RWCU/dld/RWCU_NOTICES_DLD_Archival_04082022_1.zip.001. Please ask some one to put it somewhere you can access.



Thanks

comment: [~rony], updated sampled approved. Please notify me of the new live data BEFORE you release code. I want to let RWCU know so that they have time to prepare on their end.

"These look good and imported successfully.

Please let me know when these are going to go into production as I need to adjust my automation."



Thanks
