comment: [~rony]: I think you guys are reporting that /d/is/development/ronyD/ directory does not exist. If that is the case, i need to work creating and syncing. I'll keep you guys posted when that this is fixed.



Please advise in new tickets if there are other issues. Thanks!

comment: [~rony] and [~anwarh]: I need more time. Files are still syncing and I also need help from Prem to create a shared folder in our server so that i can have the /d/is folder to place the synced files.


author: william.kong
comment: [~rony] and [~anwarh]: Prem was able to help get things configured. Can you confirm that it works? If so, please re-assign ticket back to me to review and close out.

comment: still can't check in.

I don't think this is directory issue.




author: william.kong
comment: [~rony]: Issue is fixed. Apparently the authorized keys were missing on rhs server. Please re-test the check in/out .

It says no files but there are actually files . Not sure what's the issue here. I will check more.

comment: [~rony] and [~anwarh]: I'm sync most of the /d/*** folders on RHT now. I think another 2 to 3 hours should be completed. I but I think at least /d/is/ is done.



Please re-assign ticket back to him if you confirmed it works or if there are additional issues.

We still can't check-in to parallel. There maybe mount issues. see the attached images.

comment: [~anwarh]: Can you share the error you are getting so that I can troubleshoot?



Here's what I did and I don't see any error messages:

comment: Hi [~William.Kong]

We can check-in to development but when we try to check-in parallel environment then there is a error called "cannot access '/d/is/parallel/tohidulI/': no such file or directory."

But there is already files in that directory.

author: william.kong
comment: [~tohidulI]: I just fixed it. Please re-test the parallel checkin.



Apparently I did not sync the folders correctly and the permissions were off.

+*On DSI machine:*+

+*when we tried to Checkin:*+

*!image-2020-11-13-20-18-38-237.png|width=644,height=242!*



+*Possible Cause:*+

When I checked in `RHS`, there is no folder mounted at `/d/is/parallel`

That's why even though the file shows in our DSI machine, the same file doesn't show up in the `RHS` machine

!image-2020-11-13-20-23-15-232.png|width=374,height=51!

That's why the scripts fail for parallel check-in.



+*Possible Solution:*+

I think you need to mount the `/d/is/parallel` folder into the `RHS` machine, as this shows up in our `DSI` machine.

comment: [~anwarh]: Sorry about that! I've fixed it on the rhs server. It was not mounted toca-isilon02-nfs::/rhstore/is.



good job on the troubleshooting!

comment: [~William.Kong]: That mount issue got solved, but faced another one,

Looks like you need to set up a new authentication key pair for this new server.




author: william.kong
comment: [~anwarh]: I'm not able to trouble. Which account are you using and which server are you running the parallel code submit. please share command so I can troubleshoot. Please re-assign ticket back to me when you are done.


author: anwarh
comment: [~William.Kong]: from `dsi` machine with `testmain` account.

check-in was successful, but it asks for a password when it tries to sync resources with texas.

With our old server, this process never asks for a password here.




author: william.kong
comment: [~anwarh]: I was able to fix it. Please re-test.


author: anwarh
comment: [~William.Kong]: Looks like the mounting issue resurfaced again.

Same as: [Above Comment|https://jira.infoimageinc.com/browse/IBTL-170?focusedCommentId=15104&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-15104]

comment: [~anwarh]: Can you try again? I was able to get it to work. I+think+ you were using the menlo dsi server instead of the brisbane dsi server when testing above:
