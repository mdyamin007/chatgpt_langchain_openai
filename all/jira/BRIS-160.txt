title: ca-input-pr-01:/d/input NFS Permission Issue
description: [root@rhs ~]# mount -vvv -t nfs ca-input-pr-01:/d/input /mnt/nfs/isd_input
mount: trying 10.4.20.20 prog 100003 vers 3 prot tcp port 2049
mount: trying 10.4.20.20 prog 100005 vers 3 prot udp port 45136
mount: ca-input-pr-01:/d/input failed, reason given by server: Permission denied





Can you check the ca-input-pr-01:/etc/export to confirm that the following servers have (rw) access:



ca-isis-pr-01

ca-isis-pr-02

ca-isis-pr-03

ca-preproc-pr-02

ca-preproc-pr-03

I did confirm the ports are opened

comment: [~davidt] and [~anil.dasa]: Can you guys please research this so that we can mount into production system?

comment: William,

Please use /estmt as mount point instead, Here is the list of server that were exported.



/estmt ca-isis-dv-01(rw,sync,no_subtree_check,all_squash)
/estmt ca-isis-pr-01(rw,sync,no_subtree_check,all_squash)
/estmt ca-isis-pr-02(rw,sync,no_subtree_check,all_squash)
/estmt ca-isis-pr-03(rw,sync,no_subtree_check,all_squash)
/estmt ca-preproc-pr-02(rw,sync,no_subtree_check,all_squash)
/estmt ca-preproc-pr-03(rw,sync,no_subtree_check,all_squash)
/estmt ca-rhstore-pr-01(rw,sync,no_subtree_check,all_squash)



Thanks

comment: [~davidt] and [~anil.dasa]: Had to change it to /estmt/input to be more specific. It is now working. Thanks!

comment: Hey William,

Not sure why it didn't work for you. Sean and Anil was able to mount it from our side.

I updated it to /estmt/input for your server but leave our alone.



Thanks

David

comment: [~davidt]: It's working. But now Kent and Prem needs to change the IP address for the ca-input-pr-01 server to be in a different subnet now. So I need to retest again.



[~kent.chan] AND [~premraj.patil]: Per our email dialog just now. Please let us know the new IP address and I will remount. Please update the Brisbane server list once you have the new IP address assigned:

comment: [~anil.dasa]: Per our troubleshooting session just now, it looks indeed that the zip file 'demo_ms1_09102020_09102020.zip' is not in:

/d/isd_input_dev/I3/MsgSample/demo/txt/ folder

There was mount issue earlier and files were created at a wrong location. After updating mount location, I see Pseg conversion error now.
