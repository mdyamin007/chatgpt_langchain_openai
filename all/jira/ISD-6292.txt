Hi Matt,

So to test this they will log into an account on the admin site. This change*Forced password change every 60 days* most likely won't be able to test right away as they would need to wait until the duration is up to prompt the user to change passwords. However, they can try and find a user who last logged in before or after 60 days.



However, the other two changes can be tested.
 # They should test this first:*Reuse of passwords going back at least 4*
 # Then this one, *User lockout after 4 failed attempts*just so the user isn't locked out before they would want to do Step 1.
