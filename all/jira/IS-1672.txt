As far as I understand, there's old version ofSNFBML31 in QA folder? Please export the project.

[~Kbittmann]

In the PDF sample,[^snfbml3131.pdf]I see lines:

For All Servicing Questions | 1-800-331-4799 | customerservice@gmc-inc.com
For New Loan Inquires, Phillip Granger | 512-829-2233 | phillipgranger@gmc-inc.com | NMLS# 357660

In the Word sample,[^Statement Added line of Text Example.docx], I see lines:

For All Servicing Questions | 1-800-331-4799 | customerservice@gmc-inc.com
For New Loan Inquires, {color:#de350b}David Roth | 303-770-2837 | davidroth@gmc-inc.com | NMLS# 397653{color}

What is the expected verbiage? (Or does it change depending on the statement data?)

comment: Hi [~Kbittmann] ,



From the project in QA folder and the dfa in production, we see that theverbiage about 'loan' does changedepending on the statement data. Now, how does the client wants it to be? Do they want the text to be static like the 'docx file' they provided, or will it be changeable depending on the data file?



[~avannik]

Thanks.

The expected verbiage should be:

For All Servicing Questions | 1-800-331-4799 | customerservice@gmc-inc.com
For New Loan Inquires,{color:#de350b}David Roth | 303-770-2837 | davidroth@gmc-inc.com | NMLS# 397653{color}

{color:#172b4d}I will confirm with the client if the data should change based on statement data sent in the file.{color}

Per the client:

Just as our current statements have{color:#333333}changeable data, we will want the red portion you have shown to be changeable like it is currently and the customers individual loan originators contact information to populate in this section.{color}

{color:#333333}Let me know if this answers your question.{color}

comment: [~rony]please export the project to QA. If, of course, it doesn't need coding first...

Can't help but think, am I the only person here who finds the situation when the requirements are given_after the task is finished_, not _before it is started_, to be slightly unnatural?

comment: Hi [~avannik],

The project:SNFBML31.zip is in QA folder.



Hi [~Kbittmann],

This is the answer to my question and the project and the sample already hold the requirements you mentioned in the answer.



Thanks.

Can you attach an updated sample to Jira or is the sample you provided on 10/9 okay to use?


author: JIRAUSER11700
comment: [~rony] [~Kbittmann]

So the manager's contact info is looked up from a table specifically for each client based on their account #. Thank you very much.

If I had the project and the requirement, I would check this change in 15 minutes - and we waste days. Guys, please, we need to change the way we work. Developer should export the project from the start, without me begging. Manager should know what the expected result is from the start, and give a definitive description of it in the field Description, which serves exactly that purpose.

Apart from that, I see no issues. Good for the client.
