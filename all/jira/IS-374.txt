For the suppression logic in comment 33 ts 20488, I just want to double check I am understanding it correctly and grabbing the correct field. Do I update program to suppress from print if the address block contain the verbiage "HOLD STATEMENT" or "AUK- RETURN MAIL" and receive archival+enotice only?

comment: Hi Jun,

Yes, this is correct; suppress from print if the address block contains the verbiage "HOLD STATEMENT" or "AUK- RETURN MAIL" - archival+enotice only.

Thank you!

I have a question for the test file "FNBT0531FAASTM1PF.TXT". The file uses "\A" as anchor and "\P" for new pages. However, there are some accounts with alot of "\P" indicator for new pages that goes from 1,2,3 then back to 1,2... again. For example, account #11227408 (pg-13 on sample) have 13 pages and account #510700179 (pg-34 on sample) have 43 pages. Most account have an anchor then a couple pages then another anchor for different account. These accounts with many pages will go to heavy. These 2 examples are hold statement which is suppressed but I want to confirm that customer expects this many # of pages as output before continuing with the coding.

I created a small sample in PDF attached "fcsbdl051_Samples_091321.pdf". Please check with customer if this is the expected output. The account # and address from the account that has the "\A" anchor will be used for posting and suppression rule.

comment: Hi Jun,

Per the client:

There are approximately 17 accounts with 'combined' statements. The two largest accounts are 510700179 and 11113402. What you have in the example is correct, the A records is the primary account.

They would like samples for the entire test file they sent. Do you know when you might be able to provide that? I also need to send them physical print samples as well.

Also, ISD is asking me for the index file.

Thank-you!
