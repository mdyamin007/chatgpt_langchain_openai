*Updated: 1/19/2022.*

To clarify, our understanding is that this is PDF Archival Setup ONLY and to adjust to their new archival requirements.

Paper was setup last year.

comment: Hi [~eric.yan],

As you know, [~andreav]turn over this job to [~kericapote].

Last year, we already have JEF-47871. I think Keri open this new story to continue. Please check with Keri if we should communicate with this Story from now on.

Thanks

comment: The archival sample has been provided to the client for review.



[~kericapote], please update PLBK's feedback here and we could keep it on track.

comment: [~eric.yan] Shauna is asking if she can have a smaller file to review on ticket 20714. Please advise.

comment: [~kericapote]

I use the 2019 5498 tax data and generated the sample. It's much smaller than the earlier one.


author: eric.yan
comment: [~kericapote]

Per client's feedback from ticket 20714 about customer name in index file.

Please ask the client to provide how the xml tag should be constructed.

Would something like this be ok?

<Index Name="Name" SmartIndexLookup="true">John Doe</Index>

Does the client have any response yet?


author: william.kong
comment: [~kericapote]: Please for status update on this project. We are still pending your responses to this project for 6 days now. Please advise.


author: kericapote
comment: [~William.Kong] [~eric.yan] The customer has not answered. One was out of the office until 12/27. Eric is a watcher on the TS ticket so he knows.


author: william.kong
comment: [~kericapote]: We do not use TeamSupport to communication after project is initiated. Please communicate via Jira system. That is the SOP.


author: william.kong
comment: [~kericapote]: Please advise status on this project. Has customer returned to review this? Tax deadline is coming up in little over 2 weeks


author: kericapote
comment: [~eric.yan] [~William.Kong] the customer has not replied to a y of my follow ups so at this point we need to just move forward with print.


author: william.kong
comment: [~kericapote]: We cannot continue with print until we have final approvals. Please consult with [~phoebe.george]to see if there is another person at the bank we can discuss since they have not responded since December 23, 2021. I would hate to think the person you are working with is no longer at the bank or OOO indefinitely. If [~phoebe.george]does not know, then we can get the AM's involved to escalate. For a client to not respond for 3 weeks is quite odd.






author: kericapote
comment: [~William.Kong] paper and archival have already been set up. I am working on archival changes. I reached out to others at the bank to see if they are ready to approve now or if we can circle back after paper taxes mail. I should hear something tomorrow.


author: eric.yan
comment: [~William.Kong]

Paper and archival is already approved prior to this archival change request. Since this story is put on hold due to client unresponse, [~kericapote] is working on the TJEF now for print stage getting started.


author: william.kong
comment: [~kericapote]: I understand you've been working on the TJEFs these last few days. Please alert [~eric.yan]here on the next steps for this project.








author: william.kong
comment: [~kericapote]: Please advise status on this ticket on the next steps. [~eric.yan]hasn't heard anything so we are assuming thing are ok.


author: william.kong
comment: [~kericapote]: Was the the revised date for this project? Would like to know what is left over for PDF Archival and eTaxes. Please be advise, this project MUST be completed no later than 2/28/2022 otherwise it may delay another 1 to 2 months to reallocate new developer to work on this project.


author: william.kong
comment: [~kericapote]: After you catchup from being OOO on Friday, please on this project.


author: kericapote
comment: [~William.Kong] I will ask the client when they plan on doing this.

The sample is ready in client pickup /d/infoftps4/plbk/client_pickup/PLBK_1099R_311_2021.zip

I used the 2021 data file instead and this is the 1099R tax data. It's the smallest size among all.


author: william.kong
comment: [~kericapote]: Just a reminder, this project has to go live no later than 2/28/2022. Please see if you can get approval next week so that we can get this project out of the way. Thanks!

For now, i'm going to mark it as 2/28/2022 in Jira.
