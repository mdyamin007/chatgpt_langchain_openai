title: VWCU - Stmt - MortgagePDFi Conversion to AFP2PDF Python [InHse]
description: Update existing processing script to no longer use PDFi tool to create pdf.
 Instead use afp2pdf.py program with index_build_multicore option for ALL statement related apps.
 The smaller daily notice jobs can use the current index_build options.

All the zip file, pgp encryption, index file contents, and PDF file naming convention must remain exactly the same original specifications.

Please ensure the standard SOP on the directory structure must be followed: 
 ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/pdf, ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/zip, ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/work is followed.
 Also, clear the folder directory folder before each processing. We do NOT want to accumulate previous runs.

The current program should support checking total PDF counts verification to make sure the expected pdf matches the total number for pdfs generated; If not, incorporate this standard verification logic

DT_JOB_ID:
 133570-C00.01-V21226

Processing Scripts to modify:
 vwcuml2_process.sh

Data Files to use:
 VWCU_ML_041221.zip





*NOTE*: This job runs on RH2 server. Since we are migrating from RH2 server to RHS, please test ALL job_sel options to ensure RHS can run with error messages in the processing log files.

comment: [~eric.yan]: Please advise if you still have this program that you originally worked on via Redmine back in May through June of last year. Here's the redmine link:[JEF #48148: PDFi to AFP2WEB Conversion Project vwcuml2 [PRINT SERVICE] - Change Requests - InfoIMAGE Tracking (infoimageinc.com)|https://track.infoimageinc.com/issues/48148]



If you do, please let us know so I can find another person to take over this project.



Please advise.



Thanks!
