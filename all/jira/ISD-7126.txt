comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] I don't see any ISD assessment on TS 27630 but from what I can tell, this is a new visa application expected to post under their existing Visa tab. Can you confirm? If so, please add 1 hour for ISD since this may require us to add a new index file prefix for processing and possibly upload new resource files from IS. Thanks
