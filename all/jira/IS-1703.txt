Attached dpvs and qa checklist. Exported the latest dfa to qa folder. Since the one in qa folder was write protected I've added the date 101222 to the name.

Thanks!

comment: OPS to scan the IMB and test it during the first production run. Because the statement has payment date sensitivity, we avoid delaying other cycles this way.
