 Ok, we are done with our review and they all commented that these are looking really great! We have the following adjustments if possible:

1) Remove the text under the account info box on the top portion of the statement 'AutoPay Enabled - See details below.' That text is now redundant and removing it will free up a little room to slide the actual AutoPay messages up a half line to give room for accounts with multiple AutoPay messages.

2) Modify the actual AutoPay messages so that they all start with 'AutoPay Enabled - ...' instead of just 'AutoPay - ....'

3) Remove 'Thank You.' from all AutoPay messages.

4) Increase the font size of the member address block on the coupon with little more space between each line to help with readability.

5) The new size of the account table is perfect, please center the box vertically between the return address logo and 'Federally Insured' text to avoid any snooping of the account info through the return address window.
