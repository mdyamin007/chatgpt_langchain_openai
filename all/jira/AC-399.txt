*IS Assessment:*



The suppression for 0.00 is in place already. We just need to add the suppression logic for 000-00-0000 tin to 1099IGEN_21.dfa for*both*the Print program and eTax program. We will not generate print and will not generate/create an eTax document for this condition to post and archive.



If PDF archival needs to be suppressed as well, please notate this into the description of work in the Jira ticket that it is required and add 1 additional programming hour to this request.



For samples, please give AC the list of accounts that program identified as being suppressed so that they confirmed we did the logic correctly. There is no need to create PDF output for samples we are testing suppression logic.
