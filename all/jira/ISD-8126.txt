title: 35649 - BKPL Control File Update
description: BKPL had email notification records that needed to be deleted from the enrollment process. These were records for users who never SSO'd in.

"delete from notification_preference where notification_preference_id in (select notification_preference_id from notification_preference np, usr_session us where us.usr_id = np.usr_id and org_id = getorgid('bkpl') and sso is not null and sess_lastlogin is null);"



Afterwards run the paperless file for the past days.
