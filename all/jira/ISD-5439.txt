comment: Mac,

Can you look into the error?
Here is the reply fronm client:
"
We tried running the file but received a new error.
Delivery Preference invalid contents of 'All Electronic'
I believe our previous files all had values of "N/A" in that field."

comment: Hello Dawn,



Yes, it did have "N/A" in that field. Here is the updated file.
