comment: [~phoebe.george] IS-1740 for IVBK is in parallel. I couldn't check-in my update. Should I ask Chad to take it down? If both are going live at the same time, we can merge. How do you want this to be handled?

Thanks!

comment: [~rukmaniR] - can you confirm that the parallel code that is separate is tied to the pilot site only? I don't believe there are any open DDA eStatement Jira tickets, but we do have a pilot site update that is not yet approved. It will most likely not get approved before the disclosure update, so should I talk with ISD about separating the code?

[~yameelee] FYI

comment: [~phoebe.george] - I checked with [~yameelee] and requested IS-1740 parallel (Chad is working on it) to be taken down and backed up. 

Thanks!

comment: [~gthillaivel] - I don't see the backer in the afp. I guess it's preprint. [~phoebe.george] Can you please confirm? But it's posted in both pilot and stage.

Here's some accounts:

11370286
11370450
11373644

Note: The same list of accounts were used for another project, so you might see two statements dated 9/30. The one with only the html icon has the backer.

Thanks!
