title: Missing anchor error handling 
description: Actually, the project handles missing anchors in print data quite well.

As a suggestion, error messages could be more informative if they contained account numbers for the statements that had their anchors missing.

[~Ricky Lopez]Currently, error message category for missing anchors is 3: continue processing other statements. Could you please confirm if that is intended behavior (and not 4: abort processing)? Just in case.

Error message category is now 4.

Can't include account number in message because the error is happening before the account number line is read from the data file.

exported the project in QA folder.

comment: Category 4 is a good practice because we're on the safe side here, but we can get back to this later if needed.
