title: WTCU [20697] [pvt] Verbiage Update when no statements are available [in house]
description: The verbiage is for when accounts/statement types is not on Electronic delivery.

WTCU does not allow user to change preference. So we will need to get verbiage from client on what they want to display.

Originally, we assess it as when the accounts do not have statements, which was incorrect, which is why we need new verbiage.
