comment: Same as ticket 17360. This client has some missing UFA.

Resolution look up the difference between paperless and p2, the insert into paperless table.

--insert into paperless (p_id, ACCT_ID, P_OLD_STATUS, p_new_status, P_MODIFIED_DATE, P_MODIFIED_BY, STMT_TYPE)
--values (p_id_seq.nextval,'67562665','N', 'B', '12-MAY-21', '1','enotice');

comment: One thing to note is that there should never be less entries in paperless compared to paperless2. This might be occurring for some accts due to their core conversion a few years back.
