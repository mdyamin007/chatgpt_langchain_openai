title: RWCU - [33005][pvt][in-house] RWCU_NOTICES_DLA_Archival_MMDDYYYY_1.zip.001 Not Received for 08172022
description: For rwcudla this issue is happening again and again. Client is not seeing correct doc_date in index file. But when we run in parallel it seems ok. It happened multiple times that I asked Dp to manually in parallel and provide the archival file to client pickup.



Since this is daily each day archival zip file got replaced in /d/pdf_afp/rwcu/rwcudla/zip folder. And we provide pgp file in client pickup which I can't decrypt to check the index file content.



I changed in below scripts:

rwcu_notice_archival.sh
 rwcudl_process.pl
 rwcudla.control



Changes are:

1. add rwcudla.ran file. Previously ran file has not been generated. This is in rwcudl_process.pl.

2. used copytoclientpickup in rwcu_notice_archival.sh

3. added ftpserver to rwcudla.control file.



Additionally for now I added another thing in rwcu_notice_archival.sh to backup the zip file ( decrypted file ) in /d/download/rwcu/archvial/ folder. So that if client report issue in index file or pdfs I can't investigate the zip file. But after sometime I will remove this code, since this will occupy huge amount of space.



Would you please release those script.

previously for rwcudla there was no ran file. I added this feature so that we can know which file got run. You can check/home/test/keep/rwcudla.ran .

previously for archival, it didn't usecopyToClientPickup.pl script to copy files in client pickup. I added this. This script keeps a log of the files copied to client pickup. you can check

the /z/ftpbu/client_pickup_log/client_pickup_10262022.log file in the folder and search forRWCU_NOTICES_DLA_Archival.



And the client is seeing issues in the archival index file on a regular basis, but I can't actually investigate because we provide them with encrypted archival files which I can't decrypt. So for now I added code so that it will keep a backup of the archival zip file that I can unzip and investigate if the client sees the issue.



This is the code for backing up the archival file inrwcu_notice_archival.sh :

mkdir -m 777 -p $d_dir/download/$cid/archival/
for pf in $e_opt_zip_dir/*; do
 cp -v $pf $d_dir/download/$cid/archival/
done



Those are the updates I did myself to better monitor if any issue arises, the client didn't ask for it. My apology to increase work load for you.

Sorry to bother you here again. There is a production issue that happened in [https://app.na3.teamsupport.com/?TicketNumber=35419]where archvial files are being correctly copied to client pick up, you can look into comment 1 in that ts.



The problem was the update I made inrwcu_notice_archival.sh ( in the previous comment, Tun released this resource ) . This script is actually used by dla dlb dlc dld ml1 lc1 scripts.

And for that I also needed to add*ftpserver_path*in the control file which I did only for dla control file and dld control file was already added. So for dlb dlc ml1 lc1 control files were missing this flag. I just added this flag to all of those control files and ran in parallel and it is successfully copying the files in client pickup.

Below are the snapshots from the processing run :

dlc:

which indicates the files got copy pasted to client pickup.



Thanks

Need your help to release this.[^IS_PROGRAM_TRANSFER_FORM_Rev 07132016-2.doc]

rwcudlb.control rwcudlc.control rwculc1.control rwcuml1.control

I forgot to add ftpserver_path to those control files initially for which archival files are not being copied to client pickup.

Hi [~dyuen]
 After this release, the issue in [https://app.na3.teamsupport.com/?TicketNumber=35419]will not happen.



Thanks
