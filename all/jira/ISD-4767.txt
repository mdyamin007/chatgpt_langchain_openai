title: ALCU  - eStatement Reporting Request (Child of 20193)
description: Please see the responses from our team below. I will have a programming request for the pricing of the click tracking and get that information to you as soon as I have it.



What is the difference between the report you would provide of when customers view their statements and the report that's available to us already?

The difference is the type of users. We have a report for InfoTrac admin users viewing statements on infotrac, but not for customers viewing their own statements.



One more question, is there any reporting information available on who is clicking on any of the eNotifications that we're sending?

I don't believe we have this kind of report available, and I'm not certain if this is possible.



We just wanted to give you this information and make sure you want to proceed with your request.
