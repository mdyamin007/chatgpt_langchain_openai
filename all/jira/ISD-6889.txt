comment: *When download the statements, set the PDF name:*
 # When click on the statements PDF icon shows the details of the statement in the new tab.
 # When download the PDF by clicking on the download icon, Previously while downloading the statement after viewing it was downloaded as download.pdf but from now for all the clients it will be downloaded as statementsMenuTabNameOnHomepage_statementDate.pdf.
*Examples:* _Member Statement_2021-11-30.pdf, eNotices_2021-03-20.pdf, Loan Statements_2021-09-15.pdf_.

comment: hi [~Andrey.Kutsenko]
 * tab name is the secondary menu item's in the statement page (*statementsMenuTabNameOnHomepage*_statementDate.pdf) not the browser's tab name. so for HFCU 'eNotice_Date.pdf' is the expected result. as you can see in the statement page above the date field the tab name is 'eNotice'

!enotice.png|width=406,height=259!


 * for FNBK they use a different template, this is their default behavior. so that's also expected.



Thanks,
