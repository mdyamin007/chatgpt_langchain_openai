comment: 7/6 Eric, Per the CID, they want the return envelope Stock # 5268 (9 envelope) add for this new notice. Not sure if you need to do anything on your end.


author: eric.yan
comment: [~barnetts]
I need to update the insert code. Please confirm with PC which insert bin is used for the return envelop.


author: barnetts
comment: Hi Eric, please use Bin #2 for return envelope Stock # 5268 (9 envelope)


author: barnetts
comment: Hi [~eric.yan],

Are we able to move the due date sooner? 


author: william.kong
comment: [~barnetts]: Eric is OOO the next 3 days and will return on Thursday. Can you please help check back in on Thursday/Friday when Eric returns. 


author: eric.yan
comment: [~barnetts]

I have other jobs in August, I'll try to provide sample sooner, but sorry I can't guarantee a earlier live day.


author: barnetts
comment: [~eric.yan],

That is fine. I can work with that, all I ask is that you keep me updated. If I can inform UTCU ahead of time they can make plans accordingly. Otherwise it will be difficult for both them and me to create wiggle room. 

Thanks, Barnett


author: barnetts
comment: [~eric.yan],

Can you please advise when the samples should be ready? UTCU is asking.

Thanks, Barnett


author: eric.yan
comment: [~barnetts]

I could provide sample by 9/7.

I also couldn't find the data file in test/UTCU_IR_BNOTE_06152021.zip.pgp, could you ask the client to place there again? Thanks.


author: eric.yan
comment: [~barnetts]

Any luck with the data file?


author: barnetts
comment: [~eric.yan],

Prem has restored the file. It is restored under: \download\utcu\test

Thanks, Barnett 


author: eric.yan
comment: Hi [~barnetts],

The first draft of sample is ready, but there're some issues of the data file that needs the client's attentions.
 # The 7th record is empty (see screenshot below)
 # Rate is missing in the test data file. (A similar bond notice UTCUDL005 has rates in the file heading)
 # The bond detail information is missing (It should be in the top right corner of the letter like UTCUDL005).
 # The letter is already at it's maximum length for one page, any longer will be printed on the second page.

The IRB Notes are not supposed to have the rate sheet attached to it. They are supposed to have 2 attachments on it 
Member Instructions (1 image)

Thanks, Barnett

comment: [~barnetts]

Are the two attachments both be physical inserts?


author: eric.yan
comment: [~barnetts]

The new sample is ready. But the following test data file's error still needs to be fixed.
 * The 7th record is empty


author: barnetts
comment: Thanks [~eric.yan],

Sent to UTCU for approval 


author: barnetts
comment: [~eric.yan]

UTCU had come question. They say that the 7th record is empty, can you please advise if this will create issues? 

For the letter length, they are okay with it going to a second page. They also want this in a Duplex format. 


author: eric.yan
comment: [~barnetts]

Yes I will create problem. The empty record will cease the program from processing. All records in the data file are expected to be in valid format.


author: william.kong
comment: [~eric.yan]: Per our conversation, you will be submitting to QA today.

comment: [~barnetts]: Please advise if this job is fully approved. [~eric.yan]has been reaching out to you, but I don't see any comments above indicating this project has been approved. Looks like the live date is 10/1/2021. Please get formal approval by 12pm PST 9/28 Wednesday so that we can RUSH the parallel for 10/1 live date.



If we miss the date, the live date will be in Jeopardy of missing and we will need to delay the live date by a few days after EOQ (i.e. Quarter-end) is completed.

Thanks!

As per conversation with Barnett - reverting status to "In Progress" because the is provided yet to AC to review


author: barnetts
comment: HI Eric,

Updated Specs: They want it Duplex and account number masked with only the last 4 showing.
and due date is pushed back. 

Thanks, Barnett 


author: eric.yan
comment: [~barnetts]

Could you update the due date to Oct 11. Thanks.


author: barnetts
comment: [~eric.yan], It is updated 


author: eric.yan
comment: [~barnetts]

New sample is available for review. 2 Issue of the data file needs to be fixed.

1) There's still empty record in the test data and it interrupts the process.

2) The first page length is too long. I moved up the paragraph position so it could fit, but the title will show through the address window. Please advise the client to move the formatted page break by 3-5 lines in the data file.




author: barnetts
comment: [~eric.yan],

I have requested updated/corrected test data file from UTCU. 


author: billr
comment: Eric,

UTCU is asking: "Can you confirm if the data in the 7th record should be the account number?"


author: eric.yan
comment: [~billr]

The left is the 7th record, which is empty. The right is a record with proper content and format.

The account number in the 7th record is 112468201.

author: eric.yan
comment: [~billr]

Since the client is still working on the data file, I think the project should be postpone to at least 10/15.


author: billr
comment: Eric,

Customer responded:

Thank you for the information. Could you please confirm that the account number should be the 7th record? That is what I'm trying to establish.

The correct sample was produced with the data for September 18th. For the sample that wasn't formatted, could you please provide me with the date on that one so I can compare data?


author: eric.yan
comment: [~billr]

The account number after the empty record is 100112732600, it should have been the 7th record.

When an empty record is encountered, it will stop the program. So any valid records after the empty record won't be processed.

We could have a meeting if the client needs further clarification.


author: billr
comment: Thanks Eric - I will follow up with the customer.


author: william.kong
comment: [~billr]: Based on this data issue, we may need to postpone the live date from 10/11 to 10/15. Please see if client can get a data issue resolved by tomorrow morning so that we do not further days the revised 10/15/2021 date.



I will update the live date to 10/15 for now.

comment: [~Bryanl]

More issues to fix. We seems to go back and forth over the same issue. I strongly suggest to have a meeting to go through the details so that the client could be on the same page.

1) Could the client raise the text on the second page to higher position, so that the text wont' overflow to the third page.

2) The empty records are not removed as described. Please note there are more than just one instance of empty records. Could you client to examine the data file and remove all records that have invalid format?

The file is incorrect, if you look in it, you have the values for the AccountNumber column as (Number 10085516). I believe we just need the number itself (10085516) and not (Number 10085516). Please look into it when you get a chance. Thanks.
