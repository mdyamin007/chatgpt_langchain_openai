author: andreav
comment: Tanmay, if paper was grouped and archival was not, wouldn't archival count be more? It seems strange that both InfoTRAC count and archival are exactly the same if we grouped correctly.



author: tanmay
comment: Hi Andrea,

1. this count is based on house-holding, so count is lesser than archival as archival excluded from grouping.
2. this is total count of letters irrespective of grouping, so count will be same as the archival.

The counting excel reflects total ltr irrespective of grouping with archival so counting is same.

I have attached grouped accounts (ufcu_daily_group_account.txt)

Thanks
Tanmay

i guess we need to add mahbuburT at/home/keep/xfer_user.txt file


author: peter.dang
comment: mahbuburT is now added to xfer_user file.


author: peter.dang
comment: Code has now released.


author: tanmay
comment: [~TunA] 
 we need to update the processing script to look up the reference file.
 Will you please release the file to production.
 Updated fileufcudla_process.sh in xfer folder (/d/is/cvs/xfer/mahbuburT)
 Thanks
 Tanmay

comment: Hi [~ratnam] [~andreav]
 TS23662
Archival sample has been attached generated from production cycle 31. Data file has also been attached.
Please review the sample.

Thanks

comment: [~andreav]/[~ratnam]: This is another UFCU project. Is this project supposed to go live with the others from ([IMPL-1826] UFCU - Update to Archival for All Apps - RUSH on Mo Stmts - Jira (infoimageinc.com))?





This particular Jira ticket is not part of this IMP-1826 so I'm needing clarification.



Thanks!

comment: Hi Will, I am just seeing this requirement. I am not sure of timeline.



Thanks

author: andreav
comment: Yes, based on Tanmay's reference to TS23662, I think developer mistakenly updated the wrong JIRA story. I do see the correct story IS-550 was updated afterwards.


author: tanmay
comment: [~ratnam]just ignore it, at first there was no Jira ticket for archival sample so i had updated this ticket, later we have Jira ticket for archival sample and that is IS-550.
