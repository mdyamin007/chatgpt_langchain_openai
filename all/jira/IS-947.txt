I don't believe the client has answered Daphne's questions on TS#26906 comment #37. For the file naming convention, I have our program set up to take inCourtesyAdvanceSuspensionLetter-YYYYMMDD.csv.pgp, but the test file received is in MMDDYYYY format: CourtesyAdvanceSuspensionLetter-03172022.csv.pgp.

Please confirm with the client what they have set up the file naming convention to be, and I will make the appropriate change to handle it.

As per Gnana's comments, she accidentally moved the status to "QA Completed."
I'm reverting to "QA in Progress."

Regarding tap test failures:

This change with the logo position will be reflected on e-notice, but I don't we'll need to verify since the issue involves physical mail.

Thanks!
