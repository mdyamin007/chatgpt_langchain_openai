The samples - are ready for the client review

[~Kbittmann] - Please be sure ISD story - assigned
Please request the print samples after client approval

[~rony] [~rumanb]
After client approval , please provide:
 - Index file and
 - dpvs
Please be sure the new resource (S1MVCURL.300) provided to ISD

comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid] 

There is no e-Notice for this application. So I will attach the DPVS only after client approval.
I also providedS1MVCURL.300 resource to ISD and Shun also uploaded it too.

Thanks!

Please place samples in client FTP. Sample size is too large to attach to Jira ticket.

Date format should be MM/DD/YYYY and $ in front of the dollar amount need to be updated.


author: JIRAUSER10912
comment: Hi [~Kbittmann] 

Here is the updated samples[^mvcudl001.pdf][^mvcudl002.pdf] with latest changes that you mentioned earlier.
Please check them and let me know that if they are ok or not

Thanks!

Signature is correct but name underneath is not on the samples. Should look like this

comment: Hi [~Kbittmann]

We only found the tiff image for signature here. Client also provided updated sample example in ts29458 comment 8 which was not attached in Jira and the dev didn't do the name update. So it would be great and necessary to provide the full information while creating jira, so that dev doesn't need to go to team support to look for full requirements.



Thanks

Samples requested.


author: igor.khosid
comment: [~Kbittmann]  please update the status of the story to "Pilot / Sample approved"


author: igor.khosid
comment: [~rumanb] - again, please confirm with [~rony] on the current work flow


author: rony
comment: Hi [~Kbittmann]

What is your last comment about the sample requested? We already provided a sample and the client approved right?

Hi[~Igor.Khosid]Kris asked for dpvs and print range without mentioning to provide these to QA, I didn't pay much attention and I asked [~rumanb]to provide the dpvs to [~Kbittmann]and that's why he directly provided it to Kris. Anyway, he is turning over this to QA.



Thanks

comment: Hi [~Kbittmann],

Per your request, I released following codes from parallel ID20220527044752.

Please double check with [~rumanb]and [~rony]in Monday, if there is anything we need to do.

I see "Need to provide new logo to isd " note in description. I believe ISD needs to upload "S1MVCURL.300" to production. Please make sure to inform ISD team to release code too. 

Thanks,

Tun
