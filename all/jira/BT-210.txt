Should we need to enable this? This will affect production.

comment: ISD and IS are working to resolve the staging Infotrac job status issue. For now, you can bypass job status only.

Job status has the details of the posting ,However the PDF in the job details only the "First Class" pdf's have all the inserts. All others have only one page and no inserts are in the PDF
First Class-acct #-4998730381

The changes were made for letter 014 which are all first class letter. And the others are for letter 013 which shouldn't contain those inserts.
