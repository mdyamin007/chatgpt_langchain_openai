{quote}Karen is out today, but wanted to reach out to you and the InfoImage team to recap some of the discussion items and next steps.



Summary:
{quote} # 
{quote}InfoImage has both certs: for the old*eastwestbankhb.com*and*eastwestbank.com*{quote}
 # 
{quote}The cert for*eastwestbankhb.com*has been installed on the InfoImage servers, so we dont have to worry about cert expiring on July 21. PLEASE CONFIRM.{quote}
 # 
{quote}Next Steps are to coordinate a date with InfoImage to have the eastwestbank.com URL setup and running in parallel with eastwestbankhb.com{quote}
