comment: [~phoebe.george]: I will be asking Le to disable the auto trigger since this project is not approved yet. This means, DP will have to manually process the job AFTER we get client approval for this project. We may need to hold their job until this passes QA.



[~lemoy28]: Please prep this for QA to review after we get approval.
