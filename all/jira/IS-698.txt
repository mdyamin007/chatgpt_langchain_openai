comment: Hi [~Shun.Kuwashima]

Could you help post the enotice index file for eqbk. This has been tested before but was put on hold for a few months.

/z/isd_input/I3/process-files/eqbk/dla_20220214_1_20220215_1222_eqbk.txt


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~eric.yan] [~kdishroon] I was able to post the file successfully. I was able to verify a few accounts for most of the letters. 

I was not able to find the following in the index file:
003
004
010
012
015

017 exists but they are all missing an account number, therefore these did not post. 


author: eric.yan
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima]

Thanks, the other letters are missing in the data file so not available.

DL017 doesn't have an account number as the verbiage has changed. I'll need to confirm AC how they want to proceed.


author: eric.yan
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima]

This is segment 2 job for DL004. Please test posting.

comment: [~eric.yan] Posted the above file successfully on pilot, I was able to find and view letters 024, 026, and 028 for a few accts each.


author: eric.yan
comment: [~kdishroon]

EQBK daily letter enotices are posted on pilot for the client to review. There are a few issues to keep in mind.

1) 003, 004, 010, 012, 015 are not posted because they are missing from the daily letter data file.

2) 017 letter is not posted because the account number is not the full length in the data file.

3) Only 024, 026 and 028 letters are posted for the OD letters ad these are the ones available in the data file.


author: william.kong
comment: [~kdishroon]: Please advise status on Eric's feedback above. Please see if you can the all the deliverables by Thursday morning 2/24; Approval date of 2/21 is missed. I want to get his approved by end of day 2/24. If we cannot get this done by this date, then we need to put this project on hold indefinitely and need to re-assign to a new different developer plus also requote the job to adjust the code with new logic to restart this project.










author: kdishroon
comment: [~eric.yan] - Can you please provide account number the client can review in Pilot?


author: eric.yan
comment: [~kdishroon]

Here are the account lists for three postings.




author: kdishroon
comment: Thank you [~eric.yan] - Please note that the client has unmasked the account number for letters 016 and 017.


author: eric.yan
comment: [~kdishroon]

I'm using the latest data file but letter 017 is still masked. Are they going to change it?


author: kdishroon
comment: Hi [~William.Kong] - Please provide a new timeline

[~eric.yan] - Per the client:

"For CD and IRA notices, we need to have the TISA added to second page. Currently, InfoImage does this. InfoCode # 001, 002, 003"

Are you able to add the TISA and upload new samples to pilot?


author: eric.yan
comment: [~kdishroon]

As discussed, please clarify what the client means by "have the TISA added to the second page". Please also keep the work of this Jira to enotice implementation only. If the client has any request to change verbiage or letter template, please open a separate PR.


author: kdishroon
comment: Hi [~eric.yan] - The doc in the first link below should be included with letters 001 and 003; the second link should be included with 002.

I just check and those backers are already implemented. EQBKB1 for 001, 003 and EQBKB2 for 002. Are you not able to view them on the enotice?


author: eric.yan
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima]

I check the pilot site and the backers are not loading, possibly due to missing resources.

Could you help to load these resources to ISD server.

author: shun.kuwashima
comment: Hi [~kdishroon] [~eric.yan], I checked acct 7422 in the index file and it contains letter code 026, which is mapped to the description '15 Day OD Letter'.

Index filename: dla_20220215_3_20220215_1802_eqbk.txt


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~kdishroon] It looks like the EQBK eNotice SOW is not updated. After talking with Eric, I saw that there were updates made to the EQBK Daily Notice SOW 2.13.2018, so we'll work on updating letter 026. Can you update the eNotice SOW or should we just be referring to the Daily Notice SOW for the letter codes/descriptions?


author: kdishroon
comment: Hi [~Shun.Kuwashima]

My apologies, I thought I had updated the SOW, I will update now and attach shortly.


author: kdishroon
comment: Here is the updated SOW:

[^EQBK eNotice SOW.docx]


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: Thanks [~kdishroon], we updated the description for letter 026 to '20 Day OD Letter'. It should be showing as such on pilot now.


author: william.kong
comment: per eric, description is fixed. Waiting for client feedback


author: kdishroon
comment: Hi [~eric.yan] and [~Shun.Kuwashima],

Here is the client's feedback:

"Will customer receive an option to opt in for e-notices? Same as e-statements. I noticed several options listed under Profile when you go to pull up your statements.  See attachment.

What happens when the 2ndor 3rdoptions are selected? As a test, I selected the 2ndoption for all of my accounts but I didnt get any type of notification or disclosure to read for approval."

[^Doc1(2).docx]


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~kdishroon] Each option applies to statements and notices. Below is what each option essentially means:
1. Electronic
2. Paper
3. Both Paper and Electronic

If the user decides to select the 2nd or 3rd option, they will need to click on the 'Submit' button at the bottom of the page to save the update. There is no notification or disclosure for approval when the delivery preference is updated. However, a disclosure should show when a new user is trying to enroll into electronic for the first time.


author: kdishroon
comment: Hi [~eric.yan],

The client is asking:

"Can InfoImage systematically prompt customers to review disclosures and approve? This would be for those customers who are already signed up for e-statements and now sign up for notices."


author: eric.yan
comment: [~kdishroon]

Is this referring to the email notification?

[~Shun.Kuwashima]

Please advise about the client's inquiry.


author: kdishroon
comment: Hi [~Shun.Kuwashima] - I think the client is just asking about if clients that are already signed up for eStatements will have to review and approve the disclosures for the eNotices; I am assuming the answer is no? Can you confirm?


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: Hi [~kdishroon], that's correct. User enrollment is not based on by app, so enrolled users should not see the disclosure/enrollment steps even if we start posting enotices to their accounts.


author: william.kong
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima]/[~eric.yan]/[~kdishroon]: Any new updates on this project? Is there a new deadline client want to meet instead of the old date of 2/28/2022? Will it be 4/30/2022? If so, would like to update so that [~eric.yan]can wrap up this final IS related project. Please advise.


author: eric.yan
comment: [~William.Kong]

I think it's still pending the client's further feedback.

[~kdishroon]

Please advise.


author: william.kong
comment: [~kdishroon]: We have not gotten any feedback for over two weeks now. Please advise if i should put this project on hold.


author: william.kong
comment: [~kdishroon]: I have not gotten any updates to this project. I will mark this project "On Hold" for now.



[~eric.yan]: FYI.


author: kdishroon
comment: [~William.Kong]and [~eric.yan] 

Here is the client's feedback; I am pending confirmation from Shun if we can do this:

*Here is what we like to do:*

*{color:#555555}5/1 {color}{color:#ff0000}New {color}{color:#555555}customers will have the option to individually enroll and accept E-notices enrollment disclosure.{color}*

*{color:#555555}6/1 {color}{color:#ff0000}Existing estatement c{color}{color:#555555}ustomers will see a shorten acknowledgment for enrollment into E-notices.{color}*

{color:#555555}*Can InfoImage track acknowledgement to enroll into E-notices on 6/1? Can InfoImage turn on E-notices for those existing customer not enrolled in notices?*{color}




author: eric.yan
comment: Hi [~Shun.Kuwashima],

Could you look at the above requirement and see if we could do it?


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~eric.yan] no we cannot, I also responded to these questions on ISD-6072


author: eric.yan
comment: [~kdishroon]

[~Shun.Kuwashima]already responded on 4/11 onISD-6072.

I don't think we could support the extra request.

This project is holding for a while.

I will remove from developer resource list, if we don't have any action within one week from now.

comment: Additional request for ISD; see ISD-6072:



- Update all user with sess_active_status as 'active' to 'pre_enroll'.

- When user with 'pre-enroll' status logs in, they will see the disclosure page. If the user agrees to the new disclosure, the status will be set to 'active' and they will not see the disclosure again. If the user choose to not agree to the disclosure, they will still be redirected to the statement page, but the disclosure will be shown to the user when they logs in again.


author: tuna
comment: Hi [~kdishroon]

This job is on and off. [~eric.yan]is no longer working for IS anymore.I removed from resource schedule.

We will need new assessment and new timeline. If client wants to resume this project, please assign PR ticket back to me.

comment: [~William.Kong] [~Peter.Dang], 

Please see ISD-6072; the client wants this change to go live when the eNotices go live:
 - Update all user with sess_active_status as 'active' to 'pre_enroll'.

 - When user with 'pre-enroll' status logs in, they will see the disclosure page. If the user agrees to the new disclosure, the status will be set to 'active' and they will not see the disclosure again. If the user choose to not agree to the disclosure, they will still be redirected to the statement page, but the disclosure will be shown to the user when they logs in again.

Who is working on this now?


author: william.kong
comment: [~kdishroon]: We have another project from [~tohidulI]([IS-989] EQBK - [23136][pvt][in-house] DP / EQBK DL Processing Enhancement to add sub-folders - Jira (infoimageinc.com)) that has a code conflict.



We need to ask [~tohidulI]to merge the code for this project with IS-989 and retest everything. This means we need client to also audit the PDF archival program along with the changes for this project.



[~TunA]is going to forward Eric's code from this project to [~tohidulI].





[~tohidulI]: [~TunA]will give you [~eric.yan]code and tell you where to get it. Please discuss with [~rony]when you can resume this project and merge your IS-989 project to this project.

Please provide sample date and new approval date since we need to reset a new Timeline expectation.






author: tuna
comment: Hi [~tohidulI], Please see William's previous comment. I will assign this project to you. Please review codes and provide tentative timeline to [~kdishroon].

Basically, [~eric.yan]already update the codes for EQBK enotice setup. Eric already tested and provided sample. But client did not approve for long time. Now, we will need sync back some of the codes before ISD can test. We will need parallel test for this update. [~eric.yan]is in ISD team now.



I provided Eric's codes and code different information below. Please let me or [~eric.yan] know if you have question.

Can you please review the blockers above and let me know if you need anything from me?

Also, the client sent a test file to the test folder with the letters you requested if you still need those.



Thank you,

The client indicated that the account type should be LN for letter 031.

author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~gthillaivel] I think acct 7701121868 happened to be posted in another index file as well. From your screenshot, the Overdraft Opt in notice should be showing under the Aug tab, not September since the index file contains date 8/31. Please check again.

Verified the acct #  7701121868  and the description matches the SOW with the Aug posting
