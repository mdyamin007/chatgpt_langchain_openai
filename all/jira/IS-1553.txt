Please start QA on this.

No project file needed to upload in QA folder, because the update is done only in processing script.

Parallel ID:20220907024339

DPVS attached.[^plbkms1102.print]

In production the dir/d/prep/plbk/tiff/ is not cleared before processing.

The update in processing script is to clear that dir before processing/extracting the check images.

For parallel the dir is/z/prep/plbk/tiff/

No ISD index file and archival sample needed to check.

IS-checklist attached.[^IS Checklist#IS-1553.docx]

Thanks
