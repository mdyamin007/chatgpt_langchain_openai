comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid],

the enotice type code of the statement for which description is missing is 068. Since there is no description for type code 068 in doc_desc table of database, eSite is showing NA in place of description. If you have the description for type code 068, then I can add it in the database.

I see that the notice you provided is posted in stage database. This new loan notices setup is currently pending test in pilot. We have not implemented this on stage yet.

comment: [~jahid.hasan] as you can see the story moved to QA for the final testing, and my understanding that everything should be ready for us.
Please update the stage and let us know

[~rony] [~Tasneem] [~Andrey.Kutsenko] - FYI we need to discuss the delivery process to QA

comment: [~Igor.Khosid] I will let you know once pilot testing is completed and stage update is done.

I have updated doc_desc table of stage database. Now, you should be able to see corresponding description for new enotice statements.

comment: [~jahid.hasan] Please update the status of the bug to "Bug Fixed" and this is a flag for [~Andrey.Kutsenko] to start testing
