You can use some job that had issue with Redtitan in production.

sanadlb

msbkdn001

clcudl501

Please follow instruction in /home/procs procedure files.

These jobs had errors in error log/d/daily/redtitan/redtitan_error.log

[~Igor.Khosid]

You may assign to QA staff that is more familiar of the process to run these jobs.

Please compare the change of this update with production file.

I added exception list handling and we could see it handle correctly in parallel.
