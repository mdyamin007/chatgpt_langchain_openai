comment: [~rony], RWCU response:

Upon looking at this test file, I do not see any notices for either of these data files. I only see the business billing statements. There should be some dormancy letters.

comment: Hi [~dyuen]

The archival was generated fromrwcuescheat0318_TEST.txt.asc file . So what's wrong client is seeing here. Is it the<DocName> and<Type> value that are currently "*BUSINESS LENDING BILLING STATEMENTS*" ? If yes, I changed it to:*ESCHEATMENT LETTER.*

comment: [~rony], per RWCU:

"The XML is still incorrect.

<Cabinet>STATEMENTS</Cabinet> should be:

<Cabinet>NOTICES</Cabinet>



Also:


 <DocName> and <Type> should be ESCHEATMENT NOTICES not ESCHEATMENT LETTERS."
----
Please correct and provide updated sample.

comment: Hi [~dyuen]

Please ask the client, so the cabinet tag value will be NOTICES for all letters right not just for escheatment letter?



sample is in/d/infoftps3/Vend_DSI/client_pickup/print_process/RWCU/dla/RWCU_NOTICES_DLA_Archival_04012022_1.zip.001

comment: Updated sample and question forwarded to RWCU, pending response.


author: rony
comment: Hi [~dyuen]

Any feedback?


author: dyuen
comment: [~rony], please see response from RWCU regarding the cabinet tag:

To answer your question; yes, all of these should be going to <Cabinet>NOTICES</Cabinet>.

As to the previous test file, I am not sure that I picked it up. Can you send another one?



Is the sample you placed in their pickup folder still there? If not, can you re-copy?



Thanks
