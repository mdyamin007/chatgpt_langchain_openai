Sample is */d/infoftps3/Vend_DSI/client_pickup/print_process/ffin/ffinms21315.2oz.pdf*

[~Peter.Dang] some points :
 # I only added those 3 pages for paper option. Took the pdfs from ticket 20497 comment 20. Didn't realize the Epic issue also has attachment which I couldn't find here.
 # Added those to the last of the statement in new physical page.
 # For estatement do I need to do anything?



Thanks,

[~rony]

This is dpvs for insert. Please print page first 4 pages from 4.2o1 which should include insert and print 5730-5732 which will not pull insert.

And for estatement please check with [~Shun.Kuwashima]in email **subject:*Index file for ffin insert*

I already provided account no there which Peter also mentioned in previous comments.
