MSM:
 # Login to the MSM page
 # Search for this Account:564807632
 # Press the Batch Download
 # Select the Account
 # Try to download a statement

SSO:

 # SSO with those information
 # Once you reach the portal page, at the top choose the batch download
 # Test it out as how you tested it on the MSM
