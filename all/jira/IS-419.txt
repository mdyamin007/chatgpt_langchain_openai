comment: [~kdishroon]: What is the expected live date for this project? This project is past due on this Story (i.e. Nov 5, 2021). Please advise.


author: kdishroon
comment: We are still pending the client's approval of the samples. I have also asked for their desired go-live date now that we have passed the original date.


author: william.kong
comment: [~kdishroon]: This project is still past due. It's almost one month now. Please advise status on this project. We do not want this project to go into code freeze period. Please as if client can provide approval by Friday 12/3. If so, we can target QA & Parallel and go live by 12/13.

The client's feedback:



"One point of clarification, however: The deletion cant be by page number due to spillover of transactions from Page 1 to Page 2; instead, the deletion needs to be of the _Projections made last Escrow_ sections."

Can we do this?

comment: Hi [~kdishroon],

From TS ticket, this was their request

!https://app.na3.teamsupport.com/dc/1888578/images/d37c1771-9c2f-4885-ba78-4b6e1944df43.png!

And here is an account from last sample where overflow seems to work fine,

[^frstes004-127146384-page-4090.pdf]



Did they find any issue in the last sample?

Can we get approvals today so that I can update this Jira ticket with what I mentioned timeframe above?

Sample was approved.


author: william.kong
comment: [~anwarh]: Per our discussion both of us missed Keri's comment. Can you submit this to QA?



[~kdishroon]: Sorry about this. We missed your comment. Once QA is done, we need to schedule Parallel. Can we target next week to go live? If so, let's shoot for 12/15/2021 live date if all goes as plan. Please advise is you agree.

author: kdishroon
comment: [~yameelee] and [~Peter.Dang] - please hold off on release, I need to confirm with the client when they want the code release.


author: kdishroon
comment: [~yameelee], [~Peter.Dang], and [~anwarh],

The client does not want to release code until 2/7/22.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thank-you!

Keri


author: william.kong
comment: [~Peter.Dang]/[~kdishroon]: Let's hope there is no new 'other' program updates unrelated to this project is requested. If it will affect this project. If there are new request un-related this project before the 2/7/2022, we will need add hours to regress test this project.






author: kdishroon
comment: [~William.Kong] - I am not sure what you mean.


author: william.kong
comment: [~kdishroon]: I don't remember why I wrote that comment above myself. It's been a while. Are we still on target from the client to have the code released on 2/7/2022? Anwar also mentioned that this code needs to be rolled back as well. Can you also advise us which day we need to roll back this code.



[~anwarh]: Just be prepared to compare your code with what we have currently in production. I just want to make sure we did not introduce new code since you finished project (i.e. code conflicts).


author: kdishroon
comment: [~William.Kong] and [~anwarh] - Yes, code should be released on 2/7. Thanks!

[~William.Kong], Should I wait or close this right away?


author: william.kong
comment: [~anwarh]: I did not realize there is a rollback date. Unfortunately the code is released and we could not submit the rollback date as part of the release. Please leave this ticket open for now until [~kdishroon]advises the rollback date and we update this ticket to reflect that date. Thanks!


author: kdishroon
comment: [~anwarh] and [~William.Kong] 

I apologize, there is no need to roll back the code; this was a Fiserv file so we will no longer be processing these.

Thank you,
