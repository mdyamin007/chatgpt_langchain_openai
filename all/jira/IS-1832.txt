comment: [~phoebe.george] - QA completed. Should this be verified by ISD before we release it to production?

Thanks!

comment: [~Tin.Chak] Can you confirm for this if there is anything that ISD should check for this update? This is the 'pre-processing' that we discussed for the FCBT mapping files that IS is working on.

comment: [~phoebe.george] We should check it. Can you create a ISD ticket for this? Thanks.
