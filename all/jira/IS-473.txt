title: BKPL: Include Account Type for Paperless File
description: Permanent change to update IS/ISD programs to include Account Type for paperless file processing for DDA/Monthly Statements. Here is the full list tied to BKPL's Control File/data. Please use ISD newer paperless file that should include the APP Code. I think DDA statements only support D or S. Please check with Diego if you need more additional information on the app code specifications.



*D* = Checking

*S* = Savings

*L* = Loan

*T* = Certificate of Deposit & any other letter type except Safe Deposit Box

*B* = Safe Deposit Box

*P* = Promontory Statements

*W* = Wealth Management ( We understand that Wealth Mgt will not be included in the control file but we still need to assign an App Code for internal process).

comment: Hi [~William.Kong],

For PUI code, ISD can be flexible with releases unless it's near month end, which, of course, is when we want to do a code freeze across all departments.

Any given day, with enough advance notice, we can do deployment around 9-10am PST or 3-4pm PST, which is when there is a gap in processing.

Thanks,
Tai
