We are having problem with decrypting the data file:

[oper1@rhs2 mvcu]$ decrypt2.sh 20220606_012307_000.Loan_Payment_Letter_XML.xml.pgp 20220606_012307_000.Loan_Payment_Letter_XML.xml
gpg: encrypted with ELG key, ID 449C88CD
gpg: decryption failed: No secret key



Can the client provide us with another test file?



Thanks

Per the client:

We also have live production files moving to the FTP as of late yesterday if need additional files for this review. There should be a production file from yesterday and today and continue daily. If you need anything please let me know.

Please provide a smaller sampling so I may attach it to the team support ticket or place samples in client pickup.

comment: Hi [~Kbittmann]

It's only 1M sample. would you please ask DP to keep the sample in client pickup?

This is just removing a single line. Do you still want the print sample after client approval?



Thanks

On page two the REV date should be 04/22 if you can have that looked into and then there are lines running top to bottom on half of page two on all docs.

[^mvcudl101-2.pdf] with revision date updated. I don't see the lines issue . It must be client side issue. Do you see the same issue when you open it?



Thanks

DP responded on TS 29551:

No archival set up for mvcu pay loan payment (mvcudlb). The sample approval through infotrac is already disable.

Looks like we are spending much time here just to put the sample to client pickup . Would you please provide Dp the sample and ask to keep it in client pickup?

We don't have access to client pickup other wise we would do it.

Sample is:[^mvcudl101-2.pdf]
