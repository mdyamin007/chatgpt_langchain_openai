comment: [~mahbubS]-BKPL didn't like the color matching. They did provide their CMYK colors. It's100, 0, 60, 38. Can you update and we can try these colors?


author: mahbubs
comment: Hi Stephen,

CMYK value is updated in the dfa program.

Ran the process today in parallel.

DPVS attached.[^bkplms2127.print]

Use the same afp and print range of my previous mail.

Thanks

comment: Hi [~mahbubS],



Its looks like the resources used on the heavies cover page is different. See samples. You can see the difference in green.-[^BKPL SAMPLES (3).pdf]

See also these samples.The quality is better so you can better see the issue with the green on the heavies cover page. - !BKPL LOGO.jpg!

^Let me know if the cover logo color matches with the statement logo color.^

Thanks

comment: [~mahbubS]- OPS was able to print the .hvy cover page and it is looking much darker. However, the logo for the rest of the files (4.2o1) and the header bars are all printing in b/w. What happened? This needs to be updated so everything prints with that green color.

Please update and send new DPVS for print samples.

See attached output scan from OPS.

comment: Hi Stephen,

Don't worry about the b/w logo on the statement. I only wanted to see the cover logo.

For the chargeoff update i had to use the b/w logo to release it in production earlier.

Today I will add the cmyk green and color tif logo in the program.

And will use different logo for heavy cover.

Will submit a new DPVS today.

Thanks
