title:  APCU [23816] [pvt] Participating Member Statement with DSO Integration
description: Set-up Participating Member Statement with DSO Integration.

IS:

Participating Member Statement will be a separate application cloned from APCU's existing Monthly Statements.

No print, only electronic statements for setup.

*PDF archival to be confirmed (if ok to include with regular monthly statement PDF archival) - TBD

Use same template as existing monthly statements for ALL formatting; setup for posting electronically only.

Data for these statements will need to be extracted from the existing Monthly Statement Symitar file and generated into a separate file based on identification of the following - if this criteria is met, extract to a separate file to be processed as the Participating Member Statement:

Check Record 200, field 18 - this will hold the 'Account Type' number.

Anything between 8000 - 8999 will be considered the Loan Participant member.

Test file provided - see attached.

IS test processed this file; attached output in PDF; customer has approved this version.

ISD:

This new application will be accessed through a new/separate DSO channel (separate and in addition to existing SSO channel).

Posting tab name = Loan Partnerships

Use updated 'CIF' test file - attached.
