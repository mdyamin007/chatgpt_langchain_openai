comment: Before Assigning Hours -
Check how many statements for each statement type.
Check size of each pdf and afp file for each statement type.
Figure out how big of hard drives we need to order on client's behalf. 
Figure out proposed dates depending on how long it will take to deconvert all the statements as well as the archival period requested from client.

During Deconversion - 
Ask Network to mount the hard drives and provide server & path.
Create docker instance and set up mount and start deconversion process.
Do not delete zip files with pdfs unless needed for space, and if possible keep it by copying it over onto a different server with more space (PV-NAS or something)
Copy over zipped files to hard drive.

After Finished Deconversion - 
Ship hard drive to the client.
After they confirm they are able to access all statements, we can delete and purge our database and delete the zipped deconversion files.
