possibly the socket connection is failing in I3.socket.pl.

Below commands I ran to process in rht:


#cp/t/download/wecu/325180113.20200430.LOANXT.100.XML.ZIP.pgp$d_dir/ftpbu/wecubu/
#rm$home_master/keep/cksum_log/wecuml1_cksum.log
#sh-x$home_master/master/wecuml1_process.sh3bypass

Thanks,
Rony

comment: [~rony]: I think ISD PUI app is down b/c database is not up. Let's try to re-test this later when you guys login this afternoon.
