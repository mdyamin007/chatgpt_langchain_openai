I don't see tax documents from both processing on staging InfoTrac

Accounts tested:

#1172615 for processing index file 'etax_1099r_12312023_311_04152022_122746_utcu.txt' (it is only one valid account in this processing)

#1035405, #1086676, #1264632 for processing index file 'etax_5498_12312013_311_04152022_122131_utcu.txt'

I don't see statements on InfoTrac staging, the file 'etax_5498_12312013_311_04182022_132955_utcu.txt 'is UNDO and I can't process , it gives error.

Same accounts processed in file 'etax_5498_12312013_311_04152022_122131_utcu.txt' for refID =192973 but statements are not showing on eTax tab.
