per OPs:



Matt, While there is no technical requirement for the Electronic Service Requested comment, it is recommended by the USPS; it is the only visible cue as to handle the mail piece if not deliverable as addressed.



Internally, our standard practice is to add the Electronic Service Requested for any file getting ACS service and that has an IMB, AND using Return Service Requested on any application that does not have an IMB.



The set up should be done correctly, and follow our internal standard best practices. Hope that helps.

Sorry for the late response. I'm still researching the issue. I confirmed that the Electronic Service Requested is enabled but when I process it sets back to ASE1 for some reason. Production has the same issue too that  ASE3 will set back to ASE1 for each process. The issue might caused by database but not sure exactly why it is happening, and I need more time to figure this out. I will update you ASAP when the problem solved. 

Thanks,
Tevis
