comment: Hey [~kericapote],

Both [~Natalie.Tom]and I confused that we still need to update folder path from the "denial" folder to "dn" folder.

Do we need to update? Please confirm here (please don't use email).

Thanks,

Tun

comment: [~Natalie.Tom] [~TunA] Yes, the client cannot put it in a new folder. They will be putting it in the DN folder. We will need to move it manually every time they send it (Wednesdays-or late Tues night) until IS makes this change.

This update to change the ftpbu folder from "denial" to "dn" will still need to go through QA and possibly internal approval.

Since there also needs to be an update on removing the house holding feature for this application, I can combine these 2 updates together. Could this additional update on thehouse holding feature be added into the JIRA description and have QA/approval done at the same time?
