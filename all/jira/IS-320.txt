Attached samples "SSCU_Bad_PDF_Notices_08162021.zip" created from cycle 0816 data file. Password is "safecu".



Please check with customer if they agree with this logic to check for bad PDF. Case 2 below might have a very rare chance of happening that a good PDF can be returned because of a date mismatch.

1. When there is PDF with unique case # then program will check the case # was processed.
Example: S-1554_888888_08162021.pdf will check case #888888 was processed.

2. When there are MULTIPLE PDFs with same case #, program will use letter name, case # and date from PDF to check what is processed.
Example: S-1337_999999_08162021.pdf, S-1344_999999_08162021.pdf program will check files for S-1337 and S-1344 with 9999999 case # and 08162021 date was processed.

For case 2, it's important to keep the date in the PDF same as the date for the PDF filename. For example, filename date is 08162021 then date in PDF need to be August 16, 2021.
