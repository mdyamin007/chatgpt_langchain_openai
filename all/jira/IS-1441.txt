Please proceed with testing and reach out to [~tai.trinh] and [~lemoy28] for any information needed

[~tai.trinh] - If you have any information, please attach it to the story. So far, I do not see anything which can help us to start testing!

comment: Here is the video overview of how it should work: (Shared Drive)Z:\training\MM4 Demo. Note that on your machine, the shared drive might not be mapped exactly to Z:\. However, this is the same shared drive that everyone is using to share files.

Note that features shown in the video may now behave a little bit differently, but it should provide the gist of how the feature should work.

You will only be able to access this feature via the DEMO cid on Staging. There should be a Message Manager 4 tab.

You will need to go through the entire campaign creation process for the Monthly Statements for DEMO; all the way to approval. Ideally, this should be done over the course of at least two days.
 # Set up the campaign and approve it for a date range. You will only be able to set it up for future dates. Throughout this process, we are doing QA for the setup process to see if there are any found issues.
 # Once the campaign is set up and approved, the print job can be run for a cycle within the approved campaign's date range. This would have to be done on the day after the campaign was approved without developer's interferance.
 # The print script should automate everything and trigger both paper and electronic statement jobs (There may be some issues with DT-JOB-ID if that's not requested from PC and setup by Print properly). Then, everything should be reviewable on Job Status tab.
 # Once the job is approved in Job Status, the Electronic statements will also be available in Account Management.

comment: The user guide can be downloaded from here: [https://confluence.infoimageinc.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=73629710.|https://confluence.infoimageinc.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=73629710]

Name of the file is:[^Message Manager 4.0- User Guide (10_06_2022).pdf]

It is still missing information for step 3 (Message Simulation), but other than that, this details the functionality from the view of the user. The users will use the tool as instructed by the User Guide, so they will encounter errors (if they exist) when following the instructions.
