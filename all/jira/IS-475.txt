title: GCBK - [22660][pvt] Setup and Delink Notice - Savings Link
description: These are two new notices that go along with the other ticket for the fee notices. I wanted to keep them separate as this report will come from Gate City and the fee report is from Fiserv.



Service Setup Notice

Service Cancellation Notice



These will also be print and electronic. Archiving is to be determined, I dont know the logistics if it doesnt come from Fiserv.



Estimate about 10 hours for print 4 hours for estmt 4 hours for archival.=

We don't have resource to work on this until 10/11/21



Turnover to IS: 10/11/2021

-------

 IS 10hrs + ISD 4hrs + 4 hrs for archival = 18 hours

comment: Hi [~jasonV], the latest samples,GCBKDL021_Sample_v4.pdf, have been approved. Do you have an archive test file you can send to their client pickup folder to confirm if they can ingest the file OK?
Thanks!


author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~jasonV], any updates regarding the question about a test archive file for GCBK? Also the live date says 11/1, I'm not sure if we can meet that date since parallel usually takes 3-5 days and month end production is coming up soon. Thanks



[~Peter.Dang], FYI, please confirm if 11/1 live date is do-able or if we will need to push out. Thanks
