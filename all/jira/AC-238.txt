title: WFCU - [21973][pvt] Unify CU E-Statements URL Name Change
description: For this change, we will need a new certificate, and you will need to make changes on the DNS side. The current estatement DNS record is an A record. This will need to be changed to a CNAME. estatements.unifyfcu.com ->CNAME->wfcuprod.infoimageinc.com



Additionally your Online Banking vendor will need to point to the new domain as well, so we will need to coordinate this change.

the new CNAME does not need to be coordinated as it would point to the new URL which would be a seperate site from the current. We technically can have both old and new sites up in parallel, the only time there would need to be a switchover is when the SSO would need to point to the new site, which we shouldn't need to do anything for.
