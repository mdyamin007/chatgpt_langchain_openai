title: NTSB [20720] [pvt] DP Requested Tax Correction / Enhancement [in house]
description: Per Tun:

DP Requested Tax enhancement

Hours for development: 7 (IS hours) + ISD hours required
Turnover Date : 09/14/2021
1st Sample to QA: 10/21/2021
Sample Approval Date: 10/26/2021
Go live date : 10/29/2021

Assessment Details (IS):
- Parallel required: No (but need to test with DP for processing speed)

- The DFA uses 3 cross-reference files. 1 of them is already using searchfirst() and the other 2 aren't. The slow processing speed should be from this array called &ESUP_ACCT_ARR. There are over 26000 entries and it loops every time for each account #. Using searchfirst() will reduce processing time.

- Steps to update:

&ESUP_ACCT_ARR :

In BEFOREDOC, construct the array with elements for cross ref requirement.
Switch to use searchfirst() to check if there is match.

Not yet. I haven't completed the coding yet.

Coding is completed. There isn't any PDF samples since this update is to enhance processing speed. We will need to ask Neil to test the processing speed is better then pass to QA afterwards.

DP tested this in parallel and processing is improved from 4 hours to 1 hour for big file.
