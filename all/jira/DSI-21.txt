comment: hi joe,
Its not clear which login method PSCU will use? There is the configuration for Netteller & SSO, but for SSO no exchange method is there. Also in the EStatement client Version List it says PSCU only uses SSO login.  can you please confirm that?

Hi Abdullah, 



The login method for hypercube clients is always sso exchange. You can reference JDCU or other CUs. Below/Above are the index files i was able to find. I wasnt able to find a ms4 file. 



Thank you

comment: Hi Ethan,

There are some issues with *EmailHandlerFactory* class of Processing UI code base. Inside the *getEtaxEmailHanlder()* method:

# There is no default email handler returned from the method which may cause null point exception.
# There is no case written for PSCU so while processing etax email for this client it causes null point exception.

If you can look at these issues and give me feedback that would be great.

Thank you.

comment: Hi Abdullah,



Ill add in a method to check for PSCU and assign it an etax handler. 



Thanks\!

comment: [~abdullah.baki] is there anything custom that we need to bring up to the client for the migration?

comment: [~accountid:5b848b539e14d92a56be5d2e] no major change but as we wont provide email reminder feature in hypercube so in account report there wont be any data about email reminder notification.

comment: [~abdullah.baki] Just an update, PSCU does not send out etax emails to their users, which is why there was no handler set in the factory. Thanks\!
