title: MFCU - Set Up Return Mail Processing
description: Create new global processing programming for Return Mail Processing that leverages USPS Return Mail Services instead of the current InfoIMAGE Return Mail Services.

IS Dept will need to update one of the 40 global print modules to support IMB bar code in the first class mail 5.2oz, 5.hvy, 5.pm1 - 5pm5 and 5.sm1 - 5.sm5.
 Also, we need to introduce a new Mailer Service ID value for IS to use in the global programming for include the USPS Mailer Service ID value. The service code is 522
 We will need to work with ISD team to do some coding (still TBD) as to how to retrieve the USPS data.
 We will need to work with OPS on how to parse the USPS Return Mail data that they download manually to us.
