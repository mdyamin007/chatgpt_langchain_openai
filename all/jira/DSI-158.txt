I think it is okay to have createAccount enabled on Development. However, that should not be enabled on the higher environment (Pilot, Stage, etc.)

comment: I have tested NECU etax processing. My update:

Backend:
 * data is getting inserted in the following tables:etax, p_job_etax, p_job_email, ARCH_FILE.
 * no update for any account in: fin_account, paperless2, paperless

Front-end:
 * etax is showing in hypercube site. (24 months archival)
 * etax is showing in infotrac site. (24 months archival)
 * if etax status is 0 (not approved), not showing in front-end

PS:
 * tested in dev environment.
 * Ignored two columns while testing: SSN/TAX_ID | INPUT_ZIP_FILENAME
 * email notification is not tested

Please find the attached test case.
