Assessment Details (IS):
- Parallel required: no

- Assessed by Anwar

- When "Previous Balance" is not present as a transaction we should display "Previous Balance" as a hard coded description and use R:22 C:73-78(previous statement date) formatted like the other dates in the transaction section and use R:22 C:79-92 as the amount.

- This way we will always have a previous balance line to display.
