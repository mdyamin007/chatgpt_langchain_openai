Could you please upload approved pdf samples, sounds like logo is not updated on the all pages


author: jharvey
comment: [~thomasY]

Please see the original request from client. In the sample that client was given this update was not made.

For #3, Marketing noticed that the PO Box is missing from pages 9 and 21 in the disclosure pages. All the rest have it listed. Can you please standardize and use the supplied logo for all pages and include the PO Box on all?

Page 9

Page 21

Page 13 - Correct (has the PO Box listed to the right of the logo)

PO Box - still missing on the pages as per latest comments


author: thomasy
comment: [~jharvey]All the disclosure pages are pdf images provided by flcu. I'll need a new disclosure that has the PO Box added on


author: jharvey
comment: [~Igor.Khosid] [~thomasY]

I spoke with the client and the sample is correct, the logo on pages 9 and 21 cannot be updated because they come from CUNA.

Please proceed with QA with the approved sample.


author: igor.khosid
comment: [~jharvey]

The logo on Page 1 was updated to grey letters with a black mountain range and grey sun.

The logo on Pages 3, 11, 13 match the logo on page one but have the P.O. Box address to the right of them.

The logo on Pages 9 and 21 are just the plain logo, no P.O. Box next to them.

comment: [~jharvey]: Looks like we need parallel to test print quality. If that is the case, we may not be able to go live today. Will that be an issue. If so, please RUSH the parallel request.
