comment: Hi [~gthillaivel]

Would you please possible to include pc here and report the issue to enable estmt for stage for apcu monthly. I am not quite sure how to do that.

But trust me the issue is not from coding, maybe from stage site configuration. But either way you want to test everything is ok which is a good thing. So would it be possible to let pc know?

comment: [~gthillaivel] I From the PUI, I see that ms2_20220831_1_20220922_2229_apcu.txt is tied to dtjobid 133068-C30.01-V21810. It was posted yesterday and undone, is there a new file we need to post?
