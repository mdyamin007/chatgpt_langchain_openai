comment: [~MattL]: Attached samples and DPVS. Note (currently LOC does not have preprint for estmt).



I have requested ISD to upload new resources. It will show up on staging estmts once they do that.

You can have Laser print any sample as it's for preprint update only.


author: mattl
comment: [~yameelee]Client approved. Please send to QA.

Can you please advise on file names of all three whilst I get ready to ask for print samples for all updates?


author: yameelee
comment: [~MattL] You can just request for .is file for all 3 DPVS.


author: mattl
comment: [~yameelee]Can you advise on print range of each DPVS?


author: mattl
comment: [~yameelee]Also please send to QA


author: yameelee
comment: [~MattL]: It's a preprint update so it does not really matter which print range but you can request for those below for multiple pages all from .is files.
