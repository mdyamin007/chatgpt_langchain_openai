title: 18635 / 47979 - FCBT - LIQ Billing app setup
description: New application setups under their own tab:
 * 'Funds Held' tab (test with mortgage stmt type) - Funds Held - ml1
 * 'Bills' tab (test with 'billing' stmt type):
 ** LIQ Simple Bills - lq1
 ### Update eStatement Configuration to have the separated Bills type. I assume here that archival period will be the same.
 ### Update PUI to post with the Bills type instead of the default statement type.
 ### One-time update to move lq1 statements already posted to the Bills type.
 ** LIQ Complex Bills - lq2

Additional application
 * LIQ Simple Statements - ls1 - setup under default
 * LIQ Complex Statements - lq3 - setup under default



Change tab name 'eStatement' to 'Statements' and 'Notice' to 'Notices'

Visual updates:
 * CAFC: Notice desc/stmt tab desc color updated to dark blue
 * Edited enotice description color to dark blue, originally white.
