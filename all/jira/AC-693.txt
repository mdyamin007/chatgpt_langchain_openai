*Description of Work:*

Fix bug where exist xml parser programming is pulling the subsequent joint owners middle name into the previous joint owners name.



Change logic to use the new xml2bar_parser_v3.py. The following is an example of the command line:

/home/master/xml2bar_parser_v3.py spcu_stmt_043022_1 /z/anwarH/spcums3/control/spcums3_template.control /d/iss/willK/cid/spcu/ts29067/spcu_stmt_043022_1.new multiprocessing=true



Replace the existing spcums3_template.control with the /z/anwarH/spcums3/control/spcums3_template.control
