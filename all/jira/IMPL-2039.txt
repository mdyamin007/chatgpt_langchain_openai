The above data set was sent in the segment 1 OLBWELCOME letter on 4/22/22. It came back in the daily notices invalid address file. When we look at the account and google it the address seems correct. Can you tell us why this came back?



Another examples is the screen below that also came back via the member statement invalid address file.



This one is a foreign address. It also looks correct. Please tell us why this one is incorrect.

This is bug on our side. Seems like even though we are showing the address currently on the afp but the construction of the address in the index file was not correct. That's why most of the accounts went to misc repot.



Only Letter 140 is affected.

I've a fix in place, let me when know should I release it.
