Misbah, Shun in ISD is asking: Inoticed the SOW lists new letter 'Proof of Insurance Request' tied to new letter code 019, however on production I see 019 already exists with description 'Holiday Check'. I don't see any enotices in our prod database for 019 yet though, so I'm wondering if I can update that description. Can you confirm?

This is what I see in our sid, the holiday check letter is part of*Letter - Daily* application(rwcudla), letter 9.

!image-2022-10-20-10-29-53-179.png!



So not sure how 019 exists in the database. But I don't see any problem using it. So yes, please update the description.

comment: Hi [~berezinez], I'm still waiting on a confirmation from RWCU about the updated sample with verbiage on the letter. I'm fairly certain they will approve it, but I want to wait on providing updated SOW before confirmed.

Thanks

comment: Hi [~berezinez], RWCU approved the samples with the endorsement on it. I also updated the SOW per your request.

Per RWCU: "...these were received and approved. We would like to add the Return Service Requested to the letters."
