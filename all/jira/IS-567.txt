comment: [~dawnl]attached DPVS for laser print for acct #s 307922 and 307933 from cycle 10/22 (client said 10/21 but data file is 10/22). Account number 308783 is in a different cycle and I do not have DPVS for it as previous cycle process got removed when I processed the cycle 10/22.

Please request for Laser to print 4.2o1 file images 92-106, which will contain the 2 accounts.
