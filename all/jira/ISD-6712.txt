comment: [~dyuen]it has to be configured from the Infoconfig side. David will assign someone to configure it. Once the configuration is done you will be able to view it.

[~Igor.Khosid], I figured we could do simultaneously check. I verified that the change is working in InfoTRAC pilot and submitted to client for testing.

comment: [~nprimak] [~Igor.Khosid] [~jannat] [~Tin.Chak], I spoke with Kyle (AM) and the communicated live of this project was 2 weeks after development started. Based on that, we are already behind. Please advise ASAP on status of QA.

Verified 'Search by name' feature on InfoTrac Pilot, no issues.

Should I sign off the story, or wait for implementing it on staging?
