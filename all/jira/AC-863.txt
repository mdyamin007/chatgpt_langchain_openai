Currently in Balance column the amounts are showing always positive disregarding in data file those amounts have negative value at the end. Per client they wants negative sign if balance is negative and the negative sign can be before dollar sign.



Careful with the total calculation, since previously all balance amounts are taken as positive value the total was not right.



Use latest production cycle.
