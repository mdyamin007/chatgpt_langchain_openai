Per comment 1 in [https://app.na3.teamsupport.com/?TicketNumber=26286]

_Can we set the automation to process the file by 6am PST?_

Please set this cron in production. I tested in parallel already and it processed successfully.

*00 06 * * 2-6 . /home/control/daily.control; /home/master/bkplms2_process.sh 1 0 2>&1 > /d/bkpl/bkplms2_today.log*
