comment: [~zhuoxinT]- Please re-generate. I cannot attach to Team Support for some reason. I've tried twice.

comment: [~zhuoxinT]- See attached. CU reports bounceback letter is slightly different than what is in the samples. Can you please doublecheck?

comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]The sample you attached is what we are using now. And it is not the the same as the monthly statement. There are different verbiage on two letters.
Please double check and advise which one should be used!

comment: [~zhuoxinT] [~Igor.Khosid]-Thishas been approved. Please prepare for QA and change status to ready for QA. Please provide...

1. Parallel ID
2. Export projects into QA Folder
3. Provide DPVS for print samples.
4. Provide index file for QA posting.

[~Igor.Khosid] - This update is to enable the bounceback process for the One Off notices. If InfoIMAGE receives a bounceback for an eNotice, we will mail the letter with a cover letter (on the 2nd page). InfoIMAGE will NOT update the delivery preference (they stay on electronic).

Looks good (except that the bounceback page is for statements, and the document is a notice[sigh]). On to review.
