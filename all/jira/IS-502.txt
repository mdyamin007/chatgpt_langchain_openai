comment: Andrea:

I found the formatting program for the Monthly statement in parallel. I use there code for the logo and return address. I hope the code is the latest one in parallel.

That is how the transaction suppose to output when there are no transaction activity. It will display the verbiage 'No Transactions for this period.'




author: ratnam
comment: Thanks Nar. Sorry for the confusion. Please Initiate eStatement portion whenever you are ready. Regarding Invalid address report sample, CU is fine if we are able to mock data and generate a sample as we may not find members with invalid address in data.

We are finalizing PDF Archival Specifications with CU. I will and confirm and update SOW as soon as we have specs ready.



Thanks

Ratna


author: ratnam
comment: Hi Nar, please review updated PDF Archival Specifications.



Also, wanted to get an update on eStatement portion.

Is the PDF archival file name has a lower case extension or upper?

comment: Hi Nar, please use upper case.



Thanks

Also, the charater '^' within the PDF file name does not work.

We cannot produce PDF filename with this character as part of the filename.

!image-2021-12-08-17-42-23-959.png!


author: ratnam
comment: Hi Nar, I changed PDF filename to include "_". I will let CU know that we cannot support "^".



Regarding {color:#FF0000}Notice Name{color} in Index Layout and PDF filename, please note CU wants to keep space in Index layout. Space can be only removed from PDF filename. And they need loan number to be the last value in PDF filename.



*Index Layout*:

LoanNumber|MemberNumber|First Name|Last Name|Blank By Design|{color:#FF0000}Notice Name{color}|DocumentDate|\\onbaseproc\OnBaseIN\Mortgage Monthly Statements\DocumentDate_STMT  Mortgage_<seq#>_LoanNumber.PDF

*Example*:

comment: Hi Nar, CU is not able to decrypt MFCU Mortgage Archival '*MFCU_mortgage_archival_10132021_1_1.zip.pgp* . They are able to decrypt invalid address report fine. Can you check if the archival was encrypted differently? or if there is any other issue. Will checked for me and mentioned they both are using right key.



Thanks

Since William already confirmed that PGP are the same for archival and Invalid report, there is nothing more I can check. Once the file are encrypted, only the private key own by MFCU can open the file. However, I generated a new Archival file and placed in the client pickup. Please let MFCU know they have 5 days before it is removed.

comment: Hi Nar, CU is not able to decrypt and download larger archival files for all applications. They requested to send files in different sizes to test the maximum limit they are able to download. Please provide archival files starting 1st set under 600 MB, 2^nd^ set under 400 MB and 3^rd^ set under 200 MB. If this is taking longer to produce, please start of with under 600 MB and I can forward them as we have other file set ready. Please let me know if you have any questions.

author: ratnam
comment: Hi Nar, please review below feedback from CU regarding print samples. Can you try if we can adjust the position of the logo and return address slightly so that it is not cut on the right side. Also, please check if we can move the Mortgage boxes to the right a bit so that they do not show through the envelope? Please refer to attached screen shots.



CU feedback below-

In reviewing the live proofs within the enveloped and performing the tap tests, I feel like the #10 envelop being used it too big for the mailer. See screenshots attached. In some instances the logo is being cutoff, the return address is dangerously close to be blocked and the endorsements is not visible. Also if you tap it all the way to the left you see portions of the mortgage statements.



Thanks

OK. I will change the archival index extension to 'idx'.

However, the splitting of the archival file is not by 10k accounts per zip. Instead it should be by maximum zip file size 250M.


author: andreav
comment: Hi Nar, Tohid made updates to the logo and return address on the Monthly Statements based on client feedback. I asked him to share the specs with you so that you can make the changes on your end as well. 
Once you make the update, please provide a dpvs so we can send updated physical samples to the client.  The client has approved the Mortgage samples but I still want to send them new samples. 
Once the update is made, please move to QA.

Below is the request from CU. Please let Nar/ISD know if this need to be updated right now or post live?

*For member, credit card and mortgage statements, we want to center the statement on the PDFs in eStatements. On print because of the bardcoding on the left margin, the body of the statement is pushed to the right. In eStatements we want the body center on the PDF.*



Thanks
