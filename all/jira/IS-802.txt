comment: Hi [~zhuoxinT],

Client mentioned "we will be unable to generate correct monthly Average Daily Balance amounts that print on the Savings, Money Market, and checking products". (in TS26040, comment#3)

So most likely, we need to remove all "Average Daily Balance" from format program. If you see "Average Daily Balance" in other products except Savings, Money Market, and checking products. Let me know we will need to confirm with client via [~barnetts] .

Thanks!
