comment: Dawn:

For the PLOC (tfcume3), there does not appear to be an IMB. The only return address is the one under the logo. So, how should we proceed for the PLOC?

comment: Nar - I have reached out to client in TS #22377.


author: jira_naru
comment: Dawn:



Thank you for confirming. (See TS22377, #29)

The reason I asked is because IS-398, specified updating

PLOC (me3) -> TFCUME11.dfa.



However, I checked production and it looks like the program TFCUME11.dfa, is no longer used, since08/25/2020. This is because there was a JEF,JEF#41847, for reformat HELOC, CLOC and PLOC statements . So the new program isTFCUME21.dfa, which has the coupon with the IMB.

I will ignore TFCUME11.dfa

comment: Gnana:

For TFCUME21, the attached external DFA was not exported and so you are not using the right one. Please manually copy the attached DFA to the folder C:\ISIS\docdef\

[^ACCOUNTNUMBER11.dfa]



For TFCUME51, can you try importing the project again?

[IS-398] TFCU - [22377][pvt] Coupon Address Change on Statements - Jira (infoimageinc.com)

Missed approval date from 10/14/2021



Nar has two upcoming Implementation projects that he is starting now and later this month. We absolutely do not want this TFCU projects to drag to further along impacting is other two implementation projects. Can we get client commitment to get these two projects approved this week and probably we can re-schedule for an EOM live date into next month, there is a potential that this project will not resume until February 2022.



Please advise.

author: jira_naru
comment: Igor:

The correct file name are

TFCUME21,TFCUME51 andTFCUME61

I could not check these into parallel because another programmer is holding them in parallel.

So, I changed the name to

TFCUME2A, TFCUME5A and TFCUME6A.

File ms1_AccountNumber_23.txt is missing in QA folder .Error in message window
 !File_missing.PNG|thumbnail! 


author: jira_naru
comment: Gnana:

This is the same issue you had last time when you first did QA for this story. The issue is with the message manager module. It did not get exported along with the project TFCUME21, You are actually using another program's module that you have locally in /d/isis/docdef/. That is why it cannot find the TXT file.

To fix, you will need to manually place this attached program inC:\ISIS\docdef\ and reopen your project.

Tap test - *failed*>>> see attached >>>[^IS-398_Tap test failed_return coupon.pdf]

The "Total Enclosed" portion of the coupon visible through the envelope opening


author: jira_naru
comment: Dawn:

Could you check with PC or Operation to see if we can switch to a Custom Return Envelope?

I do not think I can move the amount box out of the window.

Also, if I make changes to the coupon section, I think we may have to resend sample to Los Angeles (Wells Fargo) again to re-test the coupon.


author: dawnl
comment: Nar - I will check with client.  Thanks.




author: dawnl
comment: Hi Nar, client said we can make the box smaller.  can you make the change?   "We can make it smaller, I dont think that affects the reading of the micr line."


author: jira_naru
comment: Dawn:

OK, I will try to resize the image of the box


author: igor.khosid
comment: As per the last few comments regarding failed tap test, I am reverting the story to the "QA in Progress" status.

comment: Dawn:

Can you request Laser print sample for the following:

Once Laser sample are available, please provide to QA for another tap test.
