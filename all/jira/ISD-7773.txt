Please ask the client to provide the portfolioID, which should be available from Blackknight for the API access.

If applicable, please provide one for the testing environment and one for production.


author: andreav
comment: [~eric.yan] - I have made the request.


author: andreav
comment: [~eric.yan] BK response from Kentisha: The portfolio id is the client number, which is 740. It is the same for both testing and production.


author: andreav

The statement sample is ready for review on Infotrac. IS needs to enable job tracking and get dt_job_id from PC to see job status.

comment: [~rodriguez], [~Tevis Mak], [~nischala.manjunath] - I still don't see the jobs posted on InfoTRAC, please advise.


author: rodriguez
comment: [~andreav]I ran the 9/8 Escrow cycle on staging and it is posted (please see image at end). I ran it twice with two different DT JOB ID's. I approved one to see if the estmt tracking would show up but it did not and just says "estmt job is currently running". Paper job is being tracked and shows up on OLP. [~eric.yan]can you advise on why estatement says "estmt job is currently running", I have added all the correct flags in the control file,[~andreav]I think there may be some option to turn that on via client management or maybe PC does. I will post on pilot once stage is all set.

comment: [~eric.yan] [~andreav]Update: Looks like estmt tracking is now showing up on the process I approved. [~eric.yan] may have reposted the index. However when I click on the estmt tracking pdf it says "pdf missing or corrupted".

Pilot posting is done, and only mortgage has job status tracking enabled. You could view all statements through account management now. The quality looks good to me.


author: rodriguez
comment: [~phoebe.george] [~eric.yan] [~andreav]I agree with Eric, statements look good to me too. Anyhow, Escrow Pilot is now up

Could you advise which index file is used for stage that has job tracking enabled?

[~phoebe.george],

Other than job tracking, in which I need to post the correct index file to show tracking, Stage is also good for sampling.

Please advise the client to review sample on pilot and test the Black-knight API functionality.

Resources are uploaded to all env.


author: andreav
comment: [~eric.yan] - Once all applications posted, please turn over to QA so they can test before we release to the client.  Per timeline, QA is 10/4 - 10/6 and pilot is due to client on 10/7. 
Please also provide the Authentication Values for pilot and production that were due yesterday.




author: eric.yan
comment: [~andreav]

Pilot and stage post are up with tracking enabled.

Should I send you the authentication values in email or zoom message?


author: andreav
comment: [~eric.yan] - Please send the Auth values to both me and Enrico via email. 


author: eric.yan
comment: [~andreav]

Is there any feedback from the client?


author: andreav
comment: [~eric.yan] InfoTRAC is approved but the client is working on setting up some accounts to test with for the API testing portion. We hope that gets completed today.


author: eric.yan
comment: [~andreav],

I believe the API testing is good now. Please confirm and if we should move forward to QA.


author: andreav
comment: [~eric.yan] The client wants to see some additional applications so they are going to give us the cycles to post for their review. 


author: andreav
comment: [~eric.yan] - Please process and post the following for client testing:
	YE - Escrow Analysis Statement - 01-11-2022
	YE - Annual Statement - 12-31-2021
	YE - IRS 1098 - 2021



author: eric.yan
comment: [~andreav],

Is this from new test data or from previous postings? Either way, please have print team to process the data and I could help with the posting.


author: andreav
comment: [~eric.yan] - I am clarifying with the client on additional pre-ingestion cycles they want to see. However, they did approve InfoTRAC and also what is posted so far for API. Therefore, can we move to QA so they can start to review since we are behind on the timeline?

comment: [~Tevis Mak] [~nischala.manjunath] [~rodriguez] 
Hi all.
Please provide PR ID and index files for testing

[~avannik] [~andreav] - FYI


author: andreav
comment: [~eric.yan] - Client has approved InfoTRAC and the API set up. Please provide QA what they need to start reviewing.
They have decided to only pre-ingest back to core conversion live date as per original scope.
However, for the taxes, they do want to post the 2021 1098 tax form by Dec 2023 and they will give us the old archival and updated index for to process and post. I will create a separate ticket for this effort.

comment: [~eric.yan]What is the parallel ID?


author: eric.yan
comment: [~avannik],

There's no parallel ID on the estatement side. Usually, we need to verify posting is good on Infotrac, and in this case, the black knight API works properly. I could schedule a call with you to demonstrate the testing of API.

[~Igor.Khosid], please advise if I missed anything.


author: JIRAUSER11700
comment: [~eric.yan]thank you, that would be nice


author: JIRAUSER11700
comment: QA finished - no issues.


author: andreav
comment: [~eric.yan] - In the production InfoTRAC Marketing Tab, under Create Campaign, there is no drop down for the email template like they have today in production under SNFB. Don't we need to add something? See screenshot below on what they currently have:
