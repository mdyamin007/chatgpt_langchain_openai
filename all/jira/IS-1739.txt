title: SANA: Change Check Number Text Color to Black
description: Permanent update to change check numbers on statements from blue to black as we had to remove the check image hyperlink from the PDF document for electronic posting.


Programming hour: 1hr

Turnover date: 10/24/2022

Sample Date: 10/27/2022

Sample Approval date: 10/28/2022

Live Date: 11/01/2022

 

Assessment: ISD disabled the view check link tied to the PDF eStatement so it is no longer a hyperlink. However, with removing the hyperlink on the PDF eStatement the check font is still the blue color. Remove the blue color from SANADS11.dfa.

I ran the program with updated resources.

ISD index file name: ds1_check_10242022_10272022_0404_sana.txt

I randomly checked an individual afp for the blue color. The blue color in checklist is no longer used.

afp file name:/z/sana/sanads1-indiv/sanads1_10242022_32425126_9843.afp

Thanks

comment: [~mahbubS] Thank you! Should I have ISD post this index file to pilot site for customer approval?

Thanks!


author: mahbubs
comment: Hi [~phoebe.george],

I processed for stage environment.

For pilot site approval i need to run in development environment.

I will provide the pilot version of ISD index shortly.

Thanks

comment: [~berezinez] Sorry, I was working with Ethan on this on ticket #33945. 

[~Juliana Vannik] Can you create an ISD story for this (just mirror the description and dates on the IS Story) and assign to Ethan.

[~Ethan.Yu] Can you check to see why the font is still in blue on the staging environment? Customer reviewed the index you posted in pilot and the text is black.

Thanks,

Phoebe

FYI as per [~phoebe.george] , the latest approved sample was only via index file on the pilot site.

There are no approved physical sample and there was no change to the print side, because this is an electronic posting update only.

Hope it helps.

Thank you!

QA needs to verify the posting on Stage:

Stage posting forIndex fileds1_check_10242022_10272022_0404_sana.txt

acc# 84904156check# 1148

is still showing the check number in blue color.

[~Ethan.Yu] Let me know when I can verify it, and the Stage posting is ready for QA.

Please provide a new Index file if needed.

[~phoebe.george]- fyi

comment: [~berezinez] [~mahbubS] [~Ethan.Yu] I will have DP run the file in parallel to post on staging, will update shortly.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~mahbubS] Actually, because of the check image processing, can you provide the data locations of what you used to process to pilot? I can forward that to DP, unless you are able to re-run those files in parallel environment to have a set posted to staging. We need to complete today for EOM processing tomorrow.

[~Ethan.Yu] [~berezinez] [~rony] FYI

Thanks,

comment: [~Igor.Khosid] [~berezinez] I don't know what next step would be, should I have IS managers check this? I'm not sure how QA is seeing one thing and DSI seeing another. Please confirm as we are holding the SANA EOM file.

comment: [~phoebe.george]

We just verified once again with one of the developers on site and is still showing check# in blue color on Stage.

[~Ethan.Yu]or DSI dev[~mahbubS] [~rony] - should update it on Stage.



On Pilot - the check # is showing correctly in black color.


author: phoebe.george
comment: Nouros - can you confirm if you are reviewing on PILOT or STAGING?

QA is reviewing on Staging and it is still displaying as blue. Multiple checked on QA side separately.

PILOT is displaying correctly as black, which is what the customer approved, but we need the index files ran in PARALLEL environment so they appear on staging for QA. Can you check/confirm as soon as possible?



Thanks,

Phoebe

I did cvs checkin again.

I did cvs checkout before cvs checkin. It should work now. Please try again.

There are resources of other projects that need to be released.

I kept backup of the resources regarding this task in/d/is/cvs/xfer/mahbubS_backup/IS-1739/
