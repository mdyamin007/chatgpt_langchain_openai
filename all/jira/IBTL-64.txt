comment: [~jira_naru]: Is this using PDFi? 


author: jira_naru
comment: No, not PDFI,

When running the e option alone, we format the data to create a big AFP for AFP2WEB to create individual PDF. For some reason, was not able to create big AFP. However, was able for s option.

comment: [~jira_naru]: Thanks for clarifying. Can you share the command as well.  I 'might' need Terrence and/or Ernest to review if I cannot troubleshoot this.

Please reassign back to me when you have this info.



Thanks!

comment: [~jira_naru]: Thanks for the command. I have a few brisbane reported issue to work on now and will look into this one later;  I've assigned this ticket to me.

comment: [~jira_naru]: Can you try again? I think the issue was that I was missing the following directory in red:



[williamK@rhs2 z]$ ls -l /z/ | grep -i iswk
{color:#de350b}lrwxrwxrwx 1 williamK isgroup 16 Sep 2 2020 Iswk -> /d/Iswk_new/test{color}
lrwxrwxrwx 1 williamK isgroup 16 Sep 2 2020 Iswk_new -> /d/Iswk_new/test

comment: Will,

I just reprocess and it still fail.

It is not the /d/Iswk_new/test/ path but papyrus itself that failed.

See attached log file, line 16, I believe is the issue.

[^apcuml41188.log]

comment: Please ignore last comment, Papyrus did format, this issue is the big AFP filename. Let look further..


author: jira_naru
comment: Will,

The filename for the archival AFP file is apcuml41188.afp ${cid}${jid}${seg_num}${cycle}8.afp

Note, the 8.afp just identify that this AFP generated from the e option.

However, AFP2Web is looking forapcuml418.afp, missing the cycle.

The issue is, the program was not able to get the cycle. To get the cycle, the program needs to get the filedate as follow:

filedate=`echo "$pgp_file"|cut -d'_' -f4|sed 's/\.//g'|cut -c0-6`



Unfortunately, the cut command fails because on this system (Ubuntu), the cut command field positions are numbered from 1 not zero. So, the cut command at the end of the above failed.

If you execute the cut command:

echo 'APCU_FICS_STATMENT_071820.1.zip'|cut -c0-6

you will get an error like this:

cut: fields and positions are numbered from 1
Try `cut --help' for more information.

comment: [~jira_naru]: Thanks for troubleshooting and identifying the source of the problem.



How come when I run this on rhs2 (Menlo), I also get the same error message with the cut command?

I +think+ this an existing issue on rhs2.

comment: Will,

APCUML4 is normally run on RH2, no issue with cut command on RH2.


author: william.kong
comment: [~jira_naru]: Oops. I thought we were currently testing on rhs2; Didn't realize this issue was on rh2. 

Can we update the code permanently to cut -c1-6? It looks to be backwards compatible. All of the servers in Menlo in green provides the same results.

If you agree, please submit to *Menlo*production and re-assign the ticket back to me. Since yesterday, I disabled the parallel code sync from Menlo to Brisbane. So I will need to manually sync this file:

I will need to create a new ticket (outside of your apcuml4 code) to get this logic corrected for peter/terrence to be assigned to get it to work. Here is a list of scripts I noticed using column '0':

comment: [~jira_naru]:  Were you able to get the apcu code updated to use cut -c1 command?


author: jira_naru
comment: Yes, I can modify the cut command to use c1-7 instead of c0-6


author: jira_naru
comment: I am also able to run the e-opion (archival) successfully after the cut command modification.

comment: [~jira_naru]: Thanks for the update. Will close the ticket now.
