comment: [~mac]- FYI, we're putting the eStatement portion of this project on HOLD due to the fact that the account numbers are not in the data. FFIN would like to review in the next phase.

comment: [~mac]- Can I please get an account number for each letter type posted to pilot?

comment: [~mac]- what's the status of the account list. Also, from the bank...



Im not seeing any documents. I started with loans first. These are the ones that Ive accessed none of them had any documents available:

35130047557
|15130068977|
|15230019371|
|715004332|
|1618669|
|110956|



Also note that if a loan is 12 digits long, the first digit is being dropped. As an example, the third loan in the list shows as 0320112499 but is actually 90320112449. The full correct number shows when we get to the edocs page, but not here on the initial account selection page:

Item #3 These accounts do not show in the account list, but do show in my Online Banking:
|35160000113|
|70110000181|

I also just added these two checking accounts, but found no e-docs


|1787772|
|7300107|

The issue is that there are enotices that are outside of the archival period which is why the enotices will not show up. I'm waiting to see if I can get an update list for more recent enotices for the 21 letters.

comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com], can you ask the client to send a new file with more recent dates? These are the letter codes that are posted for the enotices :

*[100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 109, 110, 111, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119]*
