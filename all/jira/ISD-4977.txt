comment: [~barnetts], I've provided the updated backers in the TS ticket, they should no longer have the comma in the address.

comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid],

You can use acct 12345 to SSO in onto pilot. Upon logging in, there should be a Disclosure tab at the top. You should see 4 of them listed, the two that have been updated are the 'Monthly Statement Disclosure' and the 'Visa Statement Disclosure'. 

May need to clear cache if you do not see the update the first time.

Thanks,
Shun
