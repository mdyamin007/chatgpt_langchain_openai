The client reached out to let me know that none of the samples contain the Courtesy Pay verbiage on a Commercial Statement. Are you able to provide a sample of those statements as well for their review?


author: JIRAUSER11103
comment: [~jharvey] 
The data file doesn't have that scenario for the Business Courtesy Pay to show the courtesy pay verbiage.

comment: [~Natalie.Tom]

I have requested a new test data file with commercial accounts included. Please see an additional request from client below with attachment.

[^Mock Up Review.docx]

For the Retail Consumer accounts I noticed that the phone number is formatted differently then what was sent in the Mock up.



Can the phone number formatting be updated to 800.351.1670 instead of 1-800-351-1670


author: JIRAUSER11103
comment: [~jharvey] 
To confirm the updated phone number no longer has 1 before the 800?


author: jharvey
comment: [~Natalie.Tom]

That is correct, they would like to remove the 1 in front of the phone number and use periods in place of dashes

Client provided new test file in TEST directory.

The client asked why the verbiage on the last 2 samples for business accounts9729202 and 9747054 are incorrect.


author: jharvey
comment: [~Natalie.Tom]



The client is saying the sample is not correct


author: JIRAUSER11103
comment: [~jharvey] 
Those 2 accounts point to the same statement requirement and print out the verbiage based on that. Did they mention what's not correct?


author: jharvey
comment: [~Natalie.Tom]

Please see response from client.

The business verbiage from the client response seems to be same for both types of business members, who are opted into One Time Visa Debit. From the statement requirements I was provided, the business verbiage for those 2 accounts are for members who are not opted intoOne Time Visa Debit. Please confirm with the client if the attached statement requirements need to be updated.

The statement requirements I'm looking at:

Please see response from client.

On 3/28, the business mock-up was provided for those who are opted in and opted out. If the member is opted out, then a courtesy pay status will not display. The accounts 9747054 and 9729202 are opted out but in the samples still have the Courtesy Pay verbiage included.


author: JIRAUSER11103
comment: [~jharvey] 
The logic from the statement requirements are that share type is 1081,1082, or 1083 AND in record 640, field 30 is not equal to 0. The following data for those accounts shows that same logic.

From the data:
Account number 9747054
 Share type 1082 (BUSINESS ADVANTAGE SD)
Field 30 in Record 640 is 50000

Account number 9729202
Share type 1083 (BUSINESS PREMIERE)
Field 30 in Record 640 is 50000

The logic is attached again in the highlighted red text to determine which verbiage is to be displayed. Please let me know what should be changed about the logic if that is incorrect.

Please see question from client below.

Would you please provide statement samples for the following accounts. These accounts are opted out, and I need to verify that no Courtesy Pay Status displays.

9796947

9796926

9797080

9796704

9796736

The 2 statements that were incorrectly showing the Courtesy Pay Status, are now correct and do not show any status.

comment: [~jharvey]: Approvals are late. If QA finishes today, maybe we can roll out tomorrow.. But if not, the live date of 4/28 will be missed.

comment: [~William.Kong]

There was an error in the mapping document that we used for programming and we have been working with the client to correct it.

This is a compliance issue and the client will be fined if the release does not happen before their statements run on 05/01. Are we able to release code by end of day on Friday? I already notified QA and OPS that this would need a rush parallel test this morning and I have submitted the print sample request.
