I updated the configuration accordingly. But there is no way to test as it is production server.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~mamunur.rashid]- Understood. What is the next step? QA and parallel test?

comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com],

We cannot do parallel testing. Cause if we generate the report manually the report will be sent to the folder/d/infoftps4/bkpl/client_pickup/ which is the production pickup location.

I think we need to generate e report manually and let client know if it is working fine.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~mamunur.rashid]- Ok, please generate the report manually and I'll get sign off from the client.

Sean said that we do not usually test this type of update. We need to wait until the next automated report generation which is the 12th of the next month.

comment: [~mamunur.rashid]- Ok got it. So is the code LIVE? If it is, I'll inform the bank.

Yeah, the Code is live.

comment: [~mamunur.rashid]- The bank has requested the following updates.



1. Please update email notification to [ebankplusservice@bankplus.net.|mailto:ebankplusservice@bankplus.net.%C2%A0%C2%A0]

2. Can you pgp encrypt with INfoIMAGE's pgp key?


author: mamunur.rashid
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com],

I updated the email notification value to[ebankplusservice@bankplus.net|mailto:ebankplusservice@bankplus.net.%C2%A0%C2%A0]

The previous pgp encryption value was [data_center@infoimageinc.com.|mailto:data_center@infoimageinc.com.]I set that again.

Which is the Infoimage's pgp key?


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~mamunur.rashid]- I believe that is our PGP key. Can you do me a favor and send me an encrypted file with that key? I'll ask DP to confirm. I need to get the decryption key from them anyway.

Encrypting the report file is a single part of the whole process. We cannot run that single part without running the whole process. So I think we need to encrypt using the encryption values as set previously.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~mamunur.rashid]- Ok. So can you generate a report file with the original encryption values set previously? I just want to be sure it can be decrypted.


author: mamunur.rashid
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com],

I generated the report and got a pgp file. Here I attached that file.[^bkpl_ms2_undeliverable_1_10312022_214715.csv.pgp]

But I got some error while copying the report file to the new pickup path/d/infoftps4/bkpl/client_pickup/. I need to talk with Sean about this.




author: mamunur.rashid
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com],

Was DP able to decrypt the pgp file that I provided? After talking with Sean I fixed the pickup path folder issue. Should I generate the report again manually?

comment: Hi [~mamunur.rashid]- Decryption was successful! So code is LIVE right? Nothing else needs to be done?


author: mamunur.rashid
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com],

Yeah, the code is live.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~mamunur.rashid]- The bank would like to update the PGP key you are using. Please see attached and provide revised sample.

[^BankPlus Public Key.asc]

comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com],

We updated PGP key for bankplus. I generated the report using the new PGP key. I am attaching that file here. Please confirm if the [^bkpl_ms2_undeliverable_1_11092022_031307.csv.pgp]client can decrypt it.




author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~mamunur.rashid]- Client confirmed they can decrypt. We're good. Thank you!
