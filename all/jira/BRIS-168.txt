title: ca-preproc-pr-02 :  Hostname Changes
description: [~premraj.patil]: Can you help me update the server hostname:



ca-preproc-pr-02 to preprocessing02

Do not change DNS, just the hostname. I did not realize our script using HOSTNAME variable for the preprocessing02 server.



Once done, I will update Nar's ticket to help retest:

https://jira.infoimageinc.com/browse/IBTL-78
