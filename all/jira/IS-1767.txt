The samples is attached below

[^ufcudl005.pdf]

+*Testing Done from my side:*+

1) The 5th Adverse Reason Field added in the 14th column

2) Added 4th key factor from column 18th

3) Made condition where i checked if there is at least one principal reason or not if there is no principal reason out of the 5 reasons i have placed the first key factor in the principal reason section.

4) Also as we have to show the first key factor in the principal reason if there doesn't exist any there might be missing key factors from the key factors for example suppose the key factor is starting from 2nd or 3rd point the key factor 1 is missing so that has also been check.

{color:#ff0000}+*Not checked:*+{color}

1) Client didn't verified the test case if there is only one key factor and no principal reason than what will be placed in the principal reason section.
