comment: Hi [~barnetts] 
Can we get a test data file from client? The one attached on TS#34467 comment #5 is not able to parse.
Please request fixed file and drop to the ftp test folder.

Or can we use the latest file from production?
Thanks

comment: Hi [~zhuoxinT],

comment: Hi [~barnetts] 

That works, but it has 4000+ accounts, only a few accounts have data 582.
It will be hard to look for those accounts for sample.
It is better to get a test file from client.

Thanks

comment: Hi [~zhuoxinT],

Can you please review ticket T#34727 and advise if we can add the following updates?


Add 'Balance Transfer' line to end to Interest Charge Calculation section.
This is the mapping for the column values provided in comment 1:
=======================
582 - Balance Transfers
=======================
Annual Percentage Rate
*  ID
*  20        Rate    Balance Transfer interest rate 1           8
* Monthly Periodic Rate
*  56        Rate    Balance Transfer periodic interest rate 1  8
* Days in Billing Cycle
*  74        Number  Balance Transfer days in billing cycle    11
* Average Daily Balance
*  47        Money   Balance Transfer average daily balance 1  17
*  Periodic Interest Charge
*  11        Money   Balance Transfer finance charge 1         17
* Cash Advance fee
* None

Thanks, Barnett

comment: Hi [~zhuoxinT],

I will follow up with OFCU about the test data.

Thanks, Barnett 


author: JIRAUSER11101
comment: [~barnetts] 
what is the mapping logic above? Can you request a better mapping on this?
like: value name: fields/position

for example: ID= 582-20? 
What is the 1 8 at the end of the line?

Annual Percentage Rate
 * ID
 * 20 Rate Balance Transfer interest rate 1 8
 * Monthly Periodic Rate
 * 56 Rate Balance Transfer periodic interest rate 1 8

comment: Hi [~zhuoxinT],

Please see OFCU response below.
Per OFCU,
If there is no data for the Balance Transfer section (582)  - then just fill in all .00 in the Balance Transfer column  in the account summary section.

Please requested corrections below. Screenshots attached for reference.  [^Screenshot 2022-11-02_.pdf]  [^Corrrections_11.3.22_.pdf] 

Per OFCU, 
1. Move the verbiage (Purchases+Cash Adv+Balance Transfers) to the next line - underneath "Total New Balances" 

2. Starting form Total New Balance - move the ALL of the amounts over to the far RIGHT of the box. It's currently in the center. 

3. I would like to use a data file that has promotions as well. I'll upload a test data file for this case to use for the samples - once this has been fixed.  Data_File_For_Case_34467.txt"

Please see below.
Correction  - Clarification on the Account Summary section

If 582_10 is found  then that value should be placed be placed in two places. Please refer to screenshot (Screenshot_11.7.22 !Screenshot_11.7.22.jpg|thumbnail! )

comment: [~barnetts] 
According to client's #37 comment, we also need to add logic to display the interest charge calculation section.

If582_47 or 582_48 is found  then display the Interest Calculation section.

582 - 47 Money Balance Transfer average daily balance 1

582 - 48 Money Balance Transfer average daily balance 2

Also  (sorry) I noticed one more mapping that I missed.

582 - 10 Money Balance Transfer transaction finance charge

If 582_10 is found  then that value should be placed be placed in two places.
