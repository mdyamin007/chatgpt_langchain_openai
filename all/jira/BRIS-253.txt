title: FTPBU Access (Job Track)
description: Kent,

Can you have someone to open CIFS port (445) from ca-ftpbu-pr-01 toca-jobtrack-pr-01/02.

We need to access FTPBU from Jobtrack server. Let me know if I should reach out to Prem directly.

Thanks
David

For ca-jobtrack-pr-01 and 02 this mount point is not working

Config:
* -fstype=cifs,rw,username=script,password=3statements*,file_mode=0777,dir_mode=0777,vers=1.0 ://ca-ftpbu-pr-01.infoimageinc.com/ftpbu/usps_ivbu/pkg/&


We have able to mount but we can not write anything there
