comment: Hi Rifat,



This is the ticket for the SUCU calendar fix. Please send it to QA and be ready for release on Monday.

As for the second part, it's for the default to display 36 month of statement. This applies to Infotrac also. The configuration is not there, I think it should be "defaultStartDate".

    2. In the SUCU's e-statement landing page statements of 36 months will be shown (previously 24 months data was shown). Test cif:777777700000373483. Sample picture is mentioned below:

I have released it to production. Can you confirm if it is working fine or not?

Thanks

comment: There were more issues. This is the feedback from the client:

SUCU reported that the 'I CANNOT SEE IT' button on the PDF Verification Step of the enrollment process is not working. Member #14291936 reported it:

Also, the calendar is overlapping the month and year now - here is a screenshot:

comment: # We couldn't reproduce the "I CANNOT see it button" issue.
 # The overlapping calendar issue is a bit odd. We couldn't find this issue on Ubuntu's Chrome but it was found on Window's Chrome browser. I have fixed that.
 # We couldn't manage to test it on a mobile device. After testing on a mobile device we will release it on production.

comment: [~mamunur.rashid] Can you confirm what behavior is happening on your end when you click the I CANNOT SEE IT button? I can relay that to the CU to confirm if other users are experiencing the correct behavior.



Thanks!

comment: [~mamunur.rashid] [~Tin.Chak] For item #1 for the I CANNOT SEE IT BUTTON, SUCU had another user try it again and it seems to be working as expected. If you cannot reproduce the issue, then please move forward with just the calendar fix. Thanks!

_It seems to be happening now only when selecting the year on desktop but happening when selecting the month and year on mobile._

comment: [~mamunur.rashid] [~Tin.Chak] Once SUCU cleared their cache, the calendar issue displayed correctly. This is good now. Thank you!
