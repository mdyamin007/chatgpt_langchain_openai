title: TKCU - Letter - DailyPDFi Conversion to AFP2PDF Python [InHse]
description: Update existing processing script to no longer use PDFi tool to create pdf.
 Instead use afp2pdf.py program with index_build_multicore option for ALL statement related apps.
 The smaller daily notice jobs can use the current index_build options.

All the zip file, pgp encryption, index file contents, and PDF file naming convention must remain exactly the same original specifications.

Please ensure the standard SOP on the directory structure must be followed: 
 ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/pdf, ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/zip, ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/work is followed.
 Also, clear the folder directory folder before each processing. We do NOT want to accumulate previous runs.

The current program should support checking total PDF counts verification to make sure the expected pdf matches the total number for pdfs generated; If not, incorporate this standard verification logic

DT_JOB_ID:
 133571-C30.01-V21352

Processing Scripts to modify:
 tkcu_dl_process.pl

Data Files to use:
 "TKCU_DN_04302021.zip.pgp, TKCU_ECL_043021.txt.pgp"



*NOTE*: This job runs on RH2 server. Since we are migrating from RH2 server to RHS, please test ALL job_sel options to ensure RHS can run with error messages in the processing log files.

comment: Good Morning [~jun]! Can you help me run TKCU PDFi one more time. I synced the RH2 fonts on production yesterday around 2:40pm-ish. So yesterday's production cycle 6/17 should be using the same arial fonts as what you used for the afp2pdf parallel. Can you create another parallel cycle 17 so that I can run another comparison.



Thanks!

Cycle 6/17 is ready in parallel env.

comment: [~jun]: Please have this project turned over to QA to review when time permits. I did confirm cycle 6/17 matched with no issues. If QA passes this project, then we just need to run parallel after EOM and go live thereafter.



[~Igor.Khosid]: I did QA the contents of the PDF and it matches for cycle 6/17. That's the only QA step I took.

Script cannot add to parallel id because another project is holding it in parallel. It's attached here instead.

comment: [~jun]:Please also run this on RHS server with 's' option so that we can run afpcompare to test. Once done, we will compare your recent parallel run proc_id from /z/afpformat folder with the /d/afpformat folder version. Please let me know so I can analyze. If there are any error messages with logs, please report them.



Please reuse cycledl1_06082022_1_tkcu.zip.

comment: [~William.Kong],

Some of the letters had verbiage update recently. I think there would be some differences if we use test an older cycle. Is it okay to test a cycle that's July 1st or later?

Also, one of the requirement was to clear out the directory before processing, but the files are kept so DP can create a DVD at the end of each month. Should we skip this requirement?


author: william.kong
comment: [~jun]: Yes, I agree with your suggestion, that it would be ok that we use a more current cycle. I did not realize there were more DFA changes. Also, you are right, please do not purge the files. Nar reported for ds1 we had to keep the zip files in the zip directory. Once you have this completed, we will retest everything. For now, I will change the status to "In Progress".

comment: Hi [~jun], [~William.Kong],

Do we have estimated new release date for this project? So I can adjust dates in IS upcoming list.

Thanks,

author: william.kong
comment: [~TunA]: Thanks for the follow-up! I'm going to estimate 8/15/2022. QA is tied up but I do hope this can be released before 8/15/2022.



[~Igor.Khosid]/[~jun]: I ran afpcompare program and there were no differences detected in the AFP level for all the letters.
