comment: Hi [~jun],

For the file Letter Code 111 client comments that the samples provided did not include a "fee" for them to validate that the calculation is correct. 
Please provide additional samples if possible

Thank you!
Juliana

comment: [~Juliana Vannik],

I see a value for "Payment Amount: " in the PDF samples. Which "fee" are they referring to?


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~jun] In the samples provided, because all the Late Charges are $0.00, they can't technically confirm that the calculation is working as expected. Would you by chance have any examples where there is an actual amount in the Late Charge so they can confirm if the calculation is working as expected?

Here is an example:

comment: [~jun]: Per our call on 5/13 with [~phoebe.george], we will do coding ahead expecting client to add MMDDYY into the individual Daily Notice file naming conventions.

e.g.:

PS_NSFNT.\{MMDDYY}.STM (PS_NSFNT.0513222)

Please update the script logic to handle the file naming convention now so that we can use on Monday. Phoebe will inform client to make sure they will get the MMDDYY file naming updated correctly. We unfortunately will NOT have time for test files to arrive for testing. They just need to get it coded correctly.



As for the requirement for adding the new letter templates logic, that will need to be a separate release date.

comment: [~jun] As discussed on our call, customer sent this test file with the MMDDYY added:

TEST/SSCU_DN_05132022_1.zip.pgp

Please review and confirm if okay to use for final testing. Also, let me know if I should have DP turnoff CRON for this weekend depending on possible release.



CORRECTION to Will's update. The file name should use an underscore:

<filename>_MMDDYY.stm

EXAMPLE: PS_NSFNT_051122.stm

The zip file contain data file for 8 letters which all added the MMDDYY at the end. I've updated the naming convention. Testing looks good.

The 2 data files that weren't in the zip were (I didn't update these since it's not in test file):

SDB_LATE.STM
 CCM_Overlimit_Notice_<mmddyyyy>.txt


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~jun] As discussed on Friday, please confirm that you will also include the SDB late notice with the update. It actually should be included in all the Fiserv files on their job list. 

Please confirm next steps for moving forward with this portion of the rush request for release, and/or if I should put on hold with DP.

comment: [~phoebe.george] [~William.Kong] [~Juliana Vannik] [~TunA],

I included the SDB late notice with the update.

Just double checking that I didn't miss anything, I've updated the process so that it can pick up file names with and without a date. All the current notices are updated except "CCM_Overlimit_Notice_<mmddyyyy>.txt" since this file already have a date.



An example of the change for one of the letters:

diff sscudle_checklist.txt /home/keep/checklist/sscudle_checklist.txt

< LN_MATNT=N=N

---
> LN_MATNT.STM=N=N



diff sscudle_process.sh /home/master/sscudle_process.sh

< elif [[ ${outfile_uc} =~ LN_MATNT_[0-9]\{6}.STM ]] || [[ ${outfile_uc} =~ LN_MATNT.STM ]];
---
> elif [[ ${outfile_uc} =~ LN_MATNT.STM ]];

comment: [~jun]: Please go ahead and release the filenaming portion first since that should be a straightforward logic update. Please update [~phoebe.george]once you have it updated.

 - Update 'Payment Amount' value field for (SSCUDLE -> DL-111)

 - Use (Total Amount Due  Late Charge ) to populate in the Payment Amount field. Currently, 'Payment Amount' is using "Past Due Amount". (see output from data dump image below).
