comment: [~dyuen] I've manually created an index file and posted those 4 accounts onto production. Like last time, it won't show under job status because ISD doesn't have the ability to create a dtjobid.  Emails should automatically send for this job too, I didn't disable since I saw DP pulled those 4 accts from the original posting.
