comment: [~rony], GCBK provided a production file we could use for testing. Please see attached.[^GCBK_MM_OPDR.110221.001.STM]

[~Peter.Dang], FYI.


author: rony
comment: Hi [~Peter.Dang]

Need suggestions. Do I set it like daily letter or monthly since this is only one application.

If I need to set it like daily can I use letter code 022, cause I noticed this letter code is not being used currently.

Let me know.


author: dyuen
comment: Hi, [~rony] it should be set up like a daily letter, but I will let [~Peter.Dang] confirm. In meantime, here is the link to the updated SOW for the Savings link Customer Notice using 022.

author: rony
comment: Hi [~Peter.Dang] [~dyuen],



So will it be a setup as a new application or just to add a new letter in the existing daily letter setup? Let me know. Since it is included in the daily notice sow, I will not set this as a new application, I will just add this letter to the existing daily letter.



Thanks,

Rony


author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~rony],

That is correct. This is not a new application, just a new daily letter.

Thanks,
Daphne


author: rony
comment: Hi [~dyuen]

Attached is a sample for this new letter. Please review before submitting. Our QA couldn't manage time to review.

Thanks


author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~rony], please send to QA as well. Thanks


author: rony
comment: Hi [~dyuen]

We normally send to onshore QA after the client approval.


author: peter.dang
comment: [~rony] [~dyuen]

Rony,

The flow will be changing soon. However, for now please send the sample to onshore QA first. QA will review and send to Daphne for client review. Once client approved, then IS will prepare to turn over to QA.




author: rony
comment: Hi [~Peter.Dang]

Hmm, should I update the status to qa request? We normally do it after the client approval and everything including scripting are done.


author: rony
comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid]

Would it be possible for you to review the sample GCBKDL022.pdf.

data file is :[^gcbk_MM_OPDR.10212021.001.STM]



I did not ask you to review the sample for us. This is the first time. I am not sure if you can manage time for it, should I change the status to QA request at this point or do you need anything else, let me know.



Thanks,

Rony


author: rony
comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid]

changed the status to qa reqeust.

Please be sure to update procs file as well, I do not see it in the parallel report


author: dyuen
comment: [~rony], can you confirm what test file cycle you are using?


author: rony
comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid]sorry for the procs file. I uploaded it in parallel id.



Hi [~dyuen]I usedGCBK_MM_OPDR.110221.001.STM for sample. And also for qa for isd index and archival ,dpvs. But for qa is it necessary to use the same cycle?



[~dyuen]I urgent request, can client send the file as pgp format*GCBK_MM_OPDR.110221.001.STM.pgp* ? All of the other data files are in pgp format except this one.

Thanks

Please advise on the pdf archival zip file name, the year should be "YY" or "YYYY"? !zip file name.GIF!

I didn't anything on archival specifications what was already existed in production. I think this is ok. Let me know.

O and please see my urgent request in my previous comment.

Thanks

comment: Hi [~dyuen]

so what is our next step here? Will you provide the print sample to the client? Anyway, if QA is ok then please create a parallel form.

Thanks


author: dyuen
comment: [~rony], QA needs to review the print samples to ensure they look OK before I initiate parallel.

[~Igor.Khosid], please attach scans of the print samples when you have time.

Thanks

author: igor.khosid
comment: [~rony] I am wondering if the eSite should be under DSi as well?
If so, please check the letter's description.


author: berezinez
comment: [~rony]

Thank you for the IS checklist but this story still in QA.

1.I need to verify eside posting +description, once its ready for QA.

2. What should be the zip file name?, please advise. pdf archival doesn't match SOW?

[~dyuen]SOW zip file name still dont match pdf archival? what it should be?


author: dyuen
comment: [~rony], the SOW is updated. It should match what GCBK has been getting

Example from production: GCBK_DLA_archival_20211102_2_1.zip

Per SOW:

author: rony
comment: This was just adding a new letter to the existing one. So I think the zip file name should not be changed.

Hi [~Igor.Khosid], would it be possible to ask for the letter description to ISD team.



Hi [~dyuen]zip file name isGCBK_DLA_archival_20211102_2_1.zip let me know if you have any concerns.


author: rony
