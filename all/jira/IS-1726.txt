comment: Hi [~diegof]

In respect to ts 29075 comment 24, My feedback is in green.



1- We would like the data on the forms left justified. Here is a sample of one of our previous forms and what it should look like. It is interesting to note that I reviewed some of my personal forms from other CU's, mortgage companies and banks and the all have the data left justified.

!image-2022-11-11-18-53-13-524.png!



{color:#00875a}Well that is a big change now if we need to change every form. I will talk to {color}[~TunA]{color:#00875a}if we proceed to do it.{color}



2- There are quite a few forms that are not reporting any data but instead show   $ .00 in a field. However, some fields are blank when there is no data. Here is one that is not reporting zeros - 5498. And the 1099 Int that is reporting zeros. Why is that?

 !image-2022-11-11-18-53-26-516.png!

!image-2022-11-11-18-53-35-284.png!

*I believe only 5498 is not showing zeros but the rest of the forms are. We can apply it to show .00 for mfcu it the client wants. Currently, we are doing it for several cids for 5498.*



We want the Mission Fed address to always show as our Meanley address along with our phone number:

!image-2022-11-11-18-53-54-435.png!

{color:#00875a}Ok, we will change it. Please update the sow as well.{color}



5- We noticed that the Mission Fed TIN box and the Member Tin/SSN boxes can vary in size and placement depending on the form. Some data is at the very bottom of the box and some are a little more centered.{color:#00875a} Is it possible to have these boxes on each form be the same and the data centered? - it would be helpful to have some screenshots but I can say this change will be a lot of change.{color}

{color:#00875a}{color}

6- Servicing Director: We found some accounts where the mailing address is a little messed up. Here is an example. The city is not reporting correctly. It should be Oceanside.

!image-2022-11-11-18-55-12-556.png|width=511,height=549!

{color:#00875a}we will look into this.{color}



{color:#00875a}7- The street address on the 1099-Int is in the wrong box.{color}

!image-2022-11-11-19-06-57-709.png|width=1359,height=588!

{color:#00875a}Current year irs mapping all forms are supporting 5 fields for address.{color}

!image-2022-11-11-18-47-24-912.png|width=887,height=286!



{color:#00875a}we are not replacing the Name of customer just the address. And in1098_1099_SD_AddressFile_12312021XressTax.csv it doesn't have any name just address.{color}

{color:#00875a}And per irs mapping besides city state zip it only supports one address line Payee Mailing Address as you see in above snapshot.{color}



{color:#00875a}And the xref data has:{color}

!image-2022-11-11-18-49-33-473.png!

{color:#00875a}We will use used 2nd column as the Payee Mailing address and 5,6,7 columns as city state zip and will not use columns in between when displaying. Please confirm if that is ok. If yes we can solve the above address issue.{color}





Thanks

Please see my previous message. And also:

as per the zoom chat with [~TunA]

The alignment issue will be lots of work and we have been using these alignments for years. So if we can explain this to the client would be helpful.

The same actually goes for the Mission Fed TIN box and the Member Tin/SSN issue. Ssn is 9 digits. So what concern client is seeing here? But again this is also the same we are using the alignments for years for all other cids.

Updates are:

The street address on the 1099-Int is in the wrong box.

Servicing Director: We found some accounts where the mailing address is a little messed up. Here is an example. The city is not reporting correctly. It should be Oceanside.



The updates that we still waiting for confirmation from clients are below ( with my feedback in color):

comment: [~rony] [~rumanb] please see in Rony's ac-secure folder the zip mfuc_tax_111022_1556_test.zip

for some reason they encrypted items twice in there but take a look.

comment: Hi [~diegof]

For both files, account no (21-40) is alphanumeric not entirely numeric.

!image-2022-11-18-17-38-05-105.png!



We need to know from the client where should we get the account no info.

Anyway, I am providing samples.

comment: on those 2(1099 MISC and 1009 NEC) [~rony] can you remove the XXXX masking?

these will not be posted and the archive is using TIN/SSN so it should be okay.
