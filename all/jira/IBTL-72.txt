comment: [~hkhosravani]: This is a known issue. Will get this fixed as soon as ISD get's the pui-stage.infoimageinc.com server up and running.


author: william.kong
comment: [~hkhosravani]: Can you re-test this? I believe the ISD pui-stage.infoimageinc.com is up now which mean I3socket.pl should be able to communicate. If it still doesn't work, please re-assign to me.

comment: [~William.Kong]My test is failing because RHS2 doesn't have papyrus authorization keys. keys are on rhs server now and ill need to wait for it to move back to rhs2.


author: william.kong
comment: [~hkhosravani]: Thanks for the clarification. I'm starting to add the server name to the subject line so that i'm aware of which system it is.  Will assign this back to me for now until we are ready with rhs2.

comment: [~hkhosravani]: Can you test one more time? We fixed the first screenshot. It was related to the Print Module not setup correctly. Ernest fixed this earlier. As for the second screenshot, I believe it will happen again. Please retry anyways so that at least we are left with 1 issue to solve version 2 issues.



Thanks!
