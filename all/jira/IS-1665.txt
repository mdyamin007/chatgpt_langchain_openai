Here is the feedback from client:

"This one, the labels need to be edited.

*Certificate - No Auto Renew at Maturity*- for this notice we need to change the labels. The first piece of information should be labeled "Account Number" vs "Share Suffix" and the second piece of information should be labeled "Share Suffix" vs "Certificate Number". The information being mapped to the notice looks good so we just need to have the labels edited.

Share Suffix XXXXXXXXX6  {color:#de350b} -> replace "Share Suffix" with "Account Number"{color}

Certificate Number 1003   {color:#de350b} -> replace "Certificate Number" with "Share Suffix"{color}

Balance as of 10/17/2022 $20,000.00

"

Thanks.
