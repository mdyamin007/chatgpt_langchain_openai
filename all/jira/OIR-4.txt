title: Provide a way to change job site location on ETA board and pull print and camera files for either site.(t19230)
description: #5) "On ETA Board, be able to Flip job site location w/o IS having to do this. Maybe a supervisor or manager level?"

    Occasionally OPS requests Terrence and/or IS to change the site location on ETA from either CA to TX or TX to CA when the print job changes site.  In doing so, print and camera files also have to be manually sent from CA to TX.

 

#6)  "CAOP & TXOP be able to Pull print and camera files for either site for added flexibility." 

    Currently DP has to manually copy every single print file from CA to TX and add the proc_id as prefix.
