estimate 4 hours per app. Mostly testing to ensure we don't create double nesting.

NOTE: This application was left off the assessment and original Jira story for assigning; Peter to assign new dates. Including placeholders for now.

I believe that we still need e-statement posting before we can submit the sample to the client.

comment: [~jasonV] I reviewed on pilot, but unfortunately, the update is not working as expected.

Based on the PDF you provided, I checked account number 16790685 - this should appear on the pilot site when posted.

I also checked account number 17595054 - this should be 'suppressed' and should NOT be posted, as it has the asterisks in the address block:

Let me know if this can be updated and/or if you want to discuss to clarify the update. Thanks!

comment: [~jasonV] Shun was able to post the new index file, and it displaying as expected. I could not view the account with asterisks on the site. but i checked two posted accounts and they were viewable, as expected since they did not have the asterisks in the address block. thanks!

Please proceed with next steps when ready. Thanks!
