title: Corrupted characters
description: Just like in print job (https://jira.infoimageinc.com/browse/BT-567), there are corrupted characters in the front page:

 !corrupted characters.png!

It seems to me that our software does not process 'em dash' character correctly. It's extended punctuation and not used often. But looks nicer than ordinary dash or two ().

Please also see my comment inhttps://jira.infoimageinc.com/browse/BT-567.
