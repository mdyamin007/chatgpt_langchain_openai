comment: [~Hamimul.Chowdhuri]& [~rony]: Updated address change file just uploaded to the /test folder and file name is "AddressChangedLetter-20220209.pgp". This is what the output file will be for the daily Address Change notices per the client via TS# 26074.



Please place close attention to line 11, on of the fields have double-quotes & comma within; This may break your programming.



[~dyuen]: I read SPCU's response that they will not include header, but I think it would be better to include it so that we can see what the column header meaning for maintenance whenever we have to troubleshoot longer term after go-live. It is recommended to include the header so that we can programmatically check the columns are in the right order based on reading the header. We've had other clients that accidentally swapped columns during production and we were not aware of it.



However, if SPCU insist they do not want the header in the data file, then we will follow their specifications.


author: dyuen
comment: [~William.Kong], I've reached out to SPCU to see if they're willing to add the headers to the data file. I will update the Jira when I hear back.

Thanks


author: dyuen
comment: [~Hamimul.Chowdhuri] [~rony] [~William.Kong], SPCU updated the ticket this morning that they will include the file to include column headers. The updated test file should be uploaded sometime today. I will update the Jira once I have it.

Thanks

comment: Hi [~dyuen]

We started working on it. We have some questions:

please attach the updated sow link

The logo and return address in the template doesn't match with existing letters.

!image-2022-02-15-16-11-33-911.png!



If we need to use the logo and return address from the template docx file would you please provide the logo?



Thanks


author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~rony], I'm almost certain we should only be using "The Police Credit Union" logo, but I reached out to SPCU to confirm. In the meantime, here is the link to the updated SOW. Can you confirm it will be Info Notice 038? I used the next available number. Thanks

comment: Hi [~dyuen]

Yes 038 correct.


author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~rony] [~Hamimul.Chowdhuri], please use the "The Police Credit Union" logo. Do not use the SF Police one.

Thanks


author: rony
comment: Hi [~dyuen]



I think the correct sow should be this one instead of the one you provided the link for.



!image-2022-02-17-14-22-07-779.png!



The sow you provided link for is actually for DNA but we are asked to add this new letter in DLB.

Thanks

comment: Hi [~dyuen]



Would you please ask for dt job id from PC for this project spcudlb both for pilot and stage?



Thanks




author: rony
comment: Hi [~William.Kong],

Is spcudlb_process.sh ( for which we are adding this letter ) is set as corn? I checked in rhs but it's commented .

!image-2022-02-17-15-01-28-031.png!

And it says discontinue in the snap. What does it mean?



Thanks

comment: Hi [~dyuen] 

Attached is the sample for you to review. Please review and if you see any issue let me know. I will provide to QA later.

[^SPCUDL038.pdf]



^Thanks^


author: dyuen
comment: [~rony], it looks like you are looking at the old SOWs. SPCU recently went through a core conversion, therefore I believe we should be working off of the SOW I highlighted below.

I will have to get back to you about the dt Job_ID since ACs typically don't request for that.

!image-2022-02-17-09-35-42-917.png!



[~Hamimul.Chowdhuri], the samples look good to me but QA will still need to review before I send to the client.

I also got a new test file.

comment: Hi [~rony],

- Can you submit sample to internal QA team ([~Igor.Khosid]) first. Then, QA will pass it to [~dyuen].?

- Client sent new test data file with heading. Can you please regenerate sample with following file?

/d/infoftps3/Vend_DSI/client_pickup/print_process/spcu/IS-833/AddressChangedLetter-20220217.pgp

- And , I think you are right. spcudlb is inactive. Because it is replaced by spcudna. (07/16/2021 ronyD JEF #48032 SPCU Core Conversion - Daily Notice).Are you adding to spcudna?

comment: [~rony]
this is correct - at this point, we need updated descriptions, mock up and pdf sample
Please, clarify which one of the samples we should be looking for: SPCUDL038.pdf or SPCUDL038-1.pdf or SPCUDL038-2.pdf

[~dyuen] could you please confirm if the "194_Address_Change_Final.docx" updated

[~berezinez] Please compare and submit for the client review

As per Rony

author: dyuen
comment: [~Igor.Khosid] [~berezinez]"194_Address_Change_Final.docx" is updated. It has the correct content/verbiage, it just has the old logo. Please disregard the logo in the .docx file.

QA pass, the changes look good, ready for CU approval.



**after approval, please request print samples, and please advise if this update is for the paper side only?


author: dyuen
comment: Samples submitted for client review.



[~berezinez], it is for paper and electronic.


author: dyuen
comment: Comment from client: "the notices look good; however, I'm seeing instances of data on the address change file not being correct. This is something we have to research on the core so will ask for this to be placed on hold until I can identify why the raw data is not reliable."

Client sample approval date is not until 3/7/22. If there is no response/update until then, then I will place Jira on hold. For now, I will leave the Jira as pending client approval.

[~dyuen] follow up for IS-833 SPCU. Can you please provide information for LASER sample printing (DPVS, print file name, print range, environment)?

Thanks!

author: rony
comment: Hi [~dyuen]

dpvs already provided 7 hours ago . You can also ask Alis .



[~berezinez], would you please contact with isd about notice name not displaying in eposting.

And about logo the mapping has old one, you can also ask [~dyuen]to be confirmed about it.



Thanks


author: dyuen
comment: [~rony], The mapping the client provided may have the old logo, but that does not mean we should be using the old logo in staging/pilot. We should only be using the "The Police Credit Union" logo. The samples you provided uses the correct one.
