title: DACB - [27195][pvt] 2022 Tax Forms paper and E
description: -------------------per Shun------------------------------

5 hours to perform the following:

- Setup etax tab on both the member site and InfoTRAC via InfoConfig

- Enable etax email template on InfoTRAC Client Management settings.

- Add DACB to the Etax Processing-UI code

- Configure etax processing on the PUI and test emails.

- Setup the AOLP flag and test

- Setup etax paperless report (aka paperless file for IS). At the moment this will not change anything, but would be good to setup in advance in case they want to have selective paperless sometime in the future.



This requires code release and server restart on our end, so by our new SOP we aim to have everything ready on stage for QA to test at least a week before releasing to production on a Wednesday. We can follow most of the IS timeline, however I noticed IS provided a live date of 9/16 which is a Friday. I think Wednesday, 9/21 would be a more suitable live date for us.

Per sow, it says data file account willl be used for posting. So don't need any xfer file to account -> member conversion . Also don't need invalid address report but only archival.

Masking is needed for ssn, per sow.

Details:

--------------------

Follow any tax archival set up script mfcu_customized_archival.pl or ufcu_customized_archival.pl. Refer to sow for archival requirement.

And need to make a soft link of that script to $dir/tax/prep/dacb/ like below.Make sure while releasing production you give this instructions to make soft link.



ask for dt job id for each form5498sa, 1099sa1042s as early as possible.

Etax is applicable but doesn't need to any extra work for etax.

Need to put an entry in tax_ssn_tin_table for ssn masking for dacb.



Dev Hour: 10 hour (archival + testing)



Timeline:



Start: 8/29

Samples: 9/6

Sample approval: 9/9

Pilot: 9/12

Pilot approval: 9/15

comment: Hi, [~kdishroon], [~rony],

Do we have index files for ISD to post onto pilot ready?


author: rony
comment: Hi [~Ethan.Yu]

No, not yet. I believe it will take some more time for things to be cleared to get the account no from Xref files.



Thanks

[~kdishroon]for some ssn from irs data it didn't match with xref file. Currently I am removing those from eposting. Please confirm this from the client what to do for those.



Thanks

Do we have a new timeline for this?

comment: Hi [~Ethan.Yu],

Still working on the timeline; can you answer this question though?

Regarding correction files, the client is unable to sent us just the corrections in standard IRS format. If they send us an individual PDF file, are we able to upload those to the eSite?

Thank you,

Keri

The client is unable to sent us just the corrections in standard IRS format. If they send us an individual PDF file, are we able to upload those to the eSite? I am assuming this would be a manual process.

I've updated the site to have selective paperless for statements and taxes.

Please let the client know we can name it whatever they prefer.

I have

"Statements" and "Taxes" as an arbitrary name for now.,



Thanks
