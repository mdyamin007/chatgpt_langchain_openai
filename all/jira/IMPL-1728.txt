Will, can you confirm which DSI programmer is assigned to this setup and BA can turnover for a timeline.

We believe it may be Anwar, but please confirm as soon as possible.

Will confirmed that Sakib will be setting up this new notice for MVCU. Can you prepare for turnover to him and confirm when you would like this scheduled?

[~William.Kong] I created the IS story (IS-421). Please assign when ready. Thanks!
