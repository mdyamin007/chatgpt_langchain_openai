comment: [~MattL]: The client missed the approval date of 6/17. I would like Eric to go through the Jira exercise to assign to QA. We may need more time for the code release date. So possibly may not meet today's live date.



[~eric.yan]: Per our conversation, please go through the QA process via Jira so that you get used to it.
