title: BKFN - [30896][pvt][in-house] DDA Statement Checks in order
description: ----------------per Leopoldo--------------------------

I pinpointed the issue, there was a bug in the code that was causing the unordered check list issue. The max number of rows per page variable was off and this was causing a miscalculation when ordering the checks in list.



Just an FYI, this bug only affected accounts with ordered check lists greater than 1 page. It only kicked in when accounts were enormously large with many ordered checks to list such as this 72 pager.
