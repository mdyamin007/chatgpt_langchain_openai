Please confirm how many email notification client want to trigger per interval?

For example: If a job have 10,000 email and we configure 2,000 per interval and each interval is 2 hour, it will take 10 hours to send all these email. Please update in the ISD JEF.

Thanks

We will configure for 8000 email per batches and 2 hours interval. At for the timing, our program are schedule to process the email and start send them at 5 PM each day if there are documented posted by that time. If any documents are posted between 5 - 9:59 PM PST, email will start process at 10 PM pst.
These are the only 2 time that we have scheduled the automation and this is global.

Thanks

David
