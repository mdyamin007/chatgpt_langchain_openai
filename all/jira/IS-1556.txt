They should be arranged in this order:

Yes, our preference is to have all inserts behind the disclosures (backer).

comment: Hi [~Bryanl],

Just a reminder, due to the size of RX tif files (inserts for Michigan), the archival size could be huge.

We are still working on to figure out a solution to reduce the archival file size.

Thanks

ForRX Optical Insert page 1 we are facing issues for paper option like below red marked in screenshot:

!image-2022-09-14-18-04-20-200.png!

The barcode and 2D barcodes with sequence number & page number are being printed over the insert as the insert is taking the full height and width of the page?

What to do in such case?

Please let CU know about this issue ASAP and request advise from them.

Thanks


author: bryanl
comment: Hi [~mahbubS]

Per client:

Due to these complications, we would like to remove the RX Optical flyer (2 pages) from the inline inserts that were planned for Michigan Members.

We'll just continue with the consumer fee schedule and T&Cs for all Members.

Let me know if you have any questions.

comment: Hi [~Bryanl]- Updated PDF sample can be found in the folder*/d/ac-secure-share/dsi_print/pramaG/ufcu/*

Please review. Thanks!


author: mahbubs
comment: Hi [~Bryanl],

FYI, the sample that Prama provided, it has the update to remove Michigan inserts.

Thanks


author: bryanl
comment: Hi [~mahbubS]

Client is still pending approval of samples but let me know the following:

It was also brought to our attention that the word "September" is misspelled at the top of our T&C insert. Is that something that you can fix on your end?

comment: Hi [~Bryanl],

All the text are part of the inline insert image. The inline insert came from client and we are just displaying it. We can't edit it.

CU need to provide corrected T&C insert tif file.

Thanks

comment: Hi [~mahbubS]

I have placed "Addendum to Terms and Conditions - Consumer BBMM Update 09.21.2022.tif" in ac-secure-share drive under \ac\bryan. Please let me know if large file size will affect anything and if internally/client needs to downsize tif size. Thanks!

comment: Hi [~Bryanl],

The data file is very big. So it's hard to generate small size sample using the print afp files.

So I am attaching some random archival individual pdf files.

Per client:

Thanks Bryan. These look good to go.

I uploaded the statement message banner in message manager earlier this week, so we should be good to go for the September statements.

Please move forward as this needs to go live EOM, thanks!

comment: QA in progress


author: bryanl
comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid] [~gthillaivel]

Print samples have been requested. Also my apologies, client had several revisions with the insert that I thought DSI worked with QA on the initial sample.

[~Bryanl]
1. Samples attached have all strike through verbiage.Did you submit the samples to client?

comment: Hi [~gthillaivel]

I spoke with [~Igor.Khosid]and will ask the clients questions 2 and 3, thanks!


author: mahbubs
comment: Hi [~gthillaivel],

About question 1:

The strike through are the part of the inline insert tif image. We are just displaying it.



About question 2:

The blue bar is already in production. Don't have to worry about it. It was their decision to display the blue header box like that while we were developing this project.



About Question 3:

"page 18" is part of the inline insert tif image.



Thanks


author: bryanl
comment: Hi [~gthillaivel]

Per client:

2.The statement design does not have the bars extending to the end of the page; however, it looks like the rounded corner is missing as shown in an older statement below. Please see UFCU30892MemberStatement.png that I attached to JIRA

3.I have confirmed page 18 is correct.


author: gthillaivel
comment: [~Bryanl]--Thanks for the confirmation.

[~mahbubS] Can you fix the item 2 from the [~Bryanl] comment

however, it looks like the rounded corner is missing as shown in an older statement below. Please see UFCU30892MemberStatement.png that I attached to JIRA


author: mahbubs
comment: Hi [~gthillaivel],

The rounded corners are no longer required. It was confirmed by Diego while we were developing the project. So don't worry about it. Client is happy with that bar how it is now.

Just focus on the inline inserts which is the supreme and prime purpose of this jira.

Thanks
