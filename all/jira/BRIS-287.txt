description: [~kent.chan]: DSi print team needs access to InfoTRAC pilot site in order for them to be able to continue testing our test systems.



Can you give them port 8380 access so that they can hit the following url:

comment: Hi [~William.Kong], shouldn't the port be `8380`?



Also, can we update this list all at once, so that we don't have to ask permission of every host one by one?

comment: [~kent.chan]: Can you double-check why DSi VPN connection cannot connect to port 8380 for ca-infotrac-pi-01.infoimageinc.com (10.5.16.181)?
