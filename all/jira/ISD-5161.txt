title: Global - Always Display DT Job ID if exists
description: PC:
#1 select estmtjobtracking from tblAL where vid = ? and active =1 

IS:
#2 select et.dt_job_id, pm.created_date 
from estmt_dt et, process_main pm 
where pm.dt_job_id = et.dt_job_id and pm.test = ? and pm.status >0 and et.cid = pm.cid
and et.cid =? and estmt_idx_file = ?;
 
#3 select INFOTRAC_FLAG from estmt_proc where ESTMT_IDX_FILE=? 

For AFP, E-Notice, E-Tax, and Document processing, remove queries #1 and #3 so that the DT-Job-ID is always pulled and displayed on the front-end. See attached image for example. E-Notice does not have estmtjobtracking, which is why the DT-JOB-ID isn't being displayed, but the request is that we always display it for internal teams to reference.

Inside Worker for EXEC methods we callcom.infoimage.processing.server.jobTracking.getJobTrackingInfo() method. This method calls another method to get dt_job_id from IS database using following query:

String sql = "select et.dt_job_id, pm.created_date "+
 " from estmt_dt et, process_main pm "+ 
 " where pm.dt_job_id = et.dt_job_id and pm.test = 0 and pm.status >0 and et.cid = pm.cid"+
 " and et.cid =? and estmt_idx_file = ?";

If this query returns the dt_job_id. That would show in the front end PUI. I think for the screenshot that you have provided, this query doesn't return any value. I don;t have the access to IS database but as far as I can see, query #2 should return value to populate dt_job_id.

Yes, looking through the code, it seems like no conditions are required for the dt_job_id column to be populated. As long as a value exists, we will always insert. We do print out some logs dependent on the flags, but as far as I saw, they do not influence dt_job_id being inserted. Is this correct?

Thanks,
 Tai

Yes. That is what my finding is so far. I could be sure if there is a case where the above query returns data and we didn't populate that in front end.

Actually, that seems to be the case. There are jobs that the query will return a value, but it is not inserted into the database.

I think I figured out the issue. In processing.conf, afp, doc, and enotice4 has "hasDtJobId" configured. The enotice job doesn't. This is probably why it's not working for GECU enotice.

Thanks,
