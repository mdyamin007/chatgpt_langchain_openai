Here is the updated DL004 letter. with the updated agreements attached. You will notice that page # 1 calls out the following variables:
* SYSTEM DATE

* JOINT MEMBER NAME
* MAILING ADDRESS LINE 1
* CITY

These fields will be pre-populated with the corresponding datafile , whcudl004_110222.txt



In the mockup of the letter template (DL004 Mockup.pdf ), I highlighted the variable fields for you. In the mockup of the data file (DL004_Datafile_Mockup.txt ) , I added the header to help with mapping the data file to the letter.

Please provide the SOW for making this change to the DL004 letter as soon as possible. We need this letter production ready no later than December 09,2022. Please let me know if you need anything else from me asap! This is a critical request. Thank you.

The updated samples with the data file provided by client is attached below

sample: [^whcudl004.pdf]

Also one thing to note is the logo provided by the client doesn't contain their address it's only the logo. For now i have hard coded the address just to provide samples. Can you please discuss that and ask for a logo with the address from the client. A screenshot is attached below. Left side is the mockup and right side is the sample

!Capture.PNG|width=940,height=344!



Thanks

The pdf samples displayed the wrong APR Old instead of New, it doesn't match the mockup and data file attached, is it the correct data file attached? Screenshot attached.

please fix it and attach a new set of samples for review.
