comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com],

We send out emails at 5pm and 10pm every night.

The question was more about what the interval between each batch should be.

So send 8000, wait X hour, send next 8000.

Thanks,
Tai

So SUR would like to send emails every 2 hours. They need to start in the morning though as these need to be sent during the day. Not at night.

comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]our automated email are set for 5 PM and 10 PM globally for all client that are triggered automatically.

We can't change the schedule to 6 AM and this is not what we has committed.

comment: [~lina]- Quick question - SURU would like us to begin sending emails out once they are approved. So if they are approved at 10 or 11am, we begin sending out the "batches" at that time. Will that be happen?

Lin is only responsible for configuring the stagger email and the interval. The timing in regard to when we trigger email and how they are being trigger remain the same from our discussion.



Thanks
