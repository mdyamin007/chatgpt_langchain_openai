I should be able to provide samples for client review today. I'm seeing if I can obtain a sample of the estatements from ISD to validate that the disclosure has been added.

This update to add a disclosure to estmt is ready for sample review.

Note that only PROVMS21.dfa is modified as it handles both of the applications that need to be updated (provms1 - DDA and provms2 - Savings)
 * Exported project files to shared drive: /d/iss/qa/PROV/PROVMS21.zip
 * DPVS for provms1 [^provms11c18_dpvs.pdf]and provms2[^provms2230_dpvs.pdf]attached, along with index files for provms1 [^ms1_10182021_1_10202021_1730_prov.txt]and provms2 [^ms2_09302021_2_10202021_1718_prov.txt].
 * Index files have been posted by ISD, and resource[^S1PROVD1.300]has been uploaded as well
 * Sample attached:[^prov_estmt_disclosure_sample.pdf]

The above sample is local output, which should suffice for customer review as I am still waiting for an estatement sample from ISD.

Attached estatement samples provided by ISD for provms1 [^provms1_estmt_disclosure_sample.pdf]and provms2[^provms2_estmt_disclosure_sample.pdf]. These can be provided to the client instead.

Thanks!

We are currently waiting for client approval of samples.

I am moving this forward for testing since client has approved samples awhile back. The TeamSupport ticket has been convoluted due to the questions about the disclosure tab on admin site and it being assigned to ISD.

We will most likely be bypassing parallel in order to meet live date of 11/12/2021. I will have to confirm with Peter.
