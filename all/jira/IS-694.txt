Latest sample is attached

author: andreav
comment: Thank you, I sent to the client for approval.


author: andreav
comment: Client approved the sample, however, I noticed that the return address has still not been updated per my request on Jan 12th. It needs to match all other apps:

The position of return address LOGO portion:
Vertical position: 0.52 inch
Horizontal position: 0.9 inch

Address portion position:
Vertical position: 0.94 inch
Horizontal position: 0.91 inch
Font: Arial 8pt

Please move to QA and provide the dpvs for QA print samples. 
Approved sample attached. [^audio_acces_pin.pdf] 
Enrico, please provide mapping.

comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid]

Looking at the print sample it doesn't look like what I submitted.

The dpvs that I provided in this comment :

https://jira.infoimageinc.com/browse/IS-694?focusedCommentId=28458&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-28458

has 2d prefixome.

And the pdf you attached in the previous comment has 2d prefix mgx , also "See Reverse Side...." text is repeating.
