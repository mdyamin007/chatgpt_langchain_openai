title: IDCU - Letter - Skip-A-Payment PDFi Conversion to AFP2PDF Python [InHse]
description: Update existing processing script to no longer use PDFi tool to create pdf.
Instead use afp2pdf.py program with index_build_multicore option for ALL statement related apps.
The smaller daily notice jobs can use the current index_build options.

All the zip file, pgp encryption, index file contents, and PDF file naming convention must remain exactly the same original specifications.

Please ensure the standard SOP on the directory structure must be followed:  
	${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/pdf, ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/zip, ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/work is followed.
	 Also, clear the folder directory folder before each processing.  We do NOT want to accumulate previous runs.

The current program should support checking total PDF counts verification to make sure the expected pdf matches the total number for pdfs generated; If not, incorporate this standard verification logic

comment: Hi, [~William.Kong], This project doesn't have archival. Code commented out.
If you want I can remove those both from the processing script and DFA.

Thanks,
Anwar

comment: [~anwarh]: Thanks for the update. I wish folks delete the commented code out. It may have originally affected my initial research. I will cancel this ticket and remove from theSmartsheet.
