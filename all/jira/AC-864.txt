title: MVCU - [31395][pvt] Description update
description: It appears we have some logic for our transaction history for ACH NSF fee to add the total amount after the transaction description. We are wanting to see if we could take that across all of our NSF and Courtesy Pay fee descriptions to match the ACH NSF item. Attached is a small snip of XML data and screenshot of NSF ACH Fee vs Courtesy Pay Fee. Let me know if there is more details, examples etc that you may need and I can get that for you. Thank you Shawn

Put amount if current transaction source option is fee.

Current dfa is actually putting the amount for fee and it also checks if the achcompany tag is not empty

so regardless of achcompany is empty or not we need to put the amount for fee besides the description

Change will be here:

Search with 'FEE' in the dfa and put amount besides the transaction description in else statement, like below:
