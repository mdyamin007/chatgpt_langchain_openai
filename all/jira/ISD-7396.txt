The sample is ready for review in pilot. It's worth to note that the sample document date is 9/2021, which is past the default enotice archival period (4 months). I've temporarily changed the enotice archival period to 24 months for testing. This won't be the case in production.

comment: [~eric.yan] [~fahad]- Issue reported...FFINpulled a couple of account numbers from the 11/10 job posted in the demo site and the accounts are listed twice  once with an account type of NA, and once with an account type of SV. They're not seeing any notices for the accounts that appear like this:
