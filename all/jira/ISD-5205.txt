comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com],
I provided the old monthly bounceback specs in the description box above. Besides changing the prefix from ms1 to ms3, do we need to change anything else or can we keep the rest of the information the same like how it was before?

Thanks,
Shun

comment: Thanks [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com], in that case the monthly stmt bounceback report schedule is completed. Let me know if we need to run these reports, otherwise I will close out this story.
