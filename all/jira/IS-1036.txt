comment: [~thomasY], can you confirm the new notice codes, if any, for these letters and confirm if samples will be ready 4/29.


author: thomasy
comment: [~dyuen]There are no new notice codes. These fall under letter 027.


author: tuna
comment: Hey [~thomasY]: Can you please confirm [~dyuen], if you can provide sample sample tomorrow?

Thanks,

Tun




author: thomasy
comment: [~dyuen]Yes samples will be ready tomorrow


author: thomasy
comment: [~dyuen]Before I can provide samples, there are some data issues I need to bring up with the test files provided.



Letter 531: LOC Inactive Date is missing

Letter 533: No data provided

Letter 535: No data provided

Letter 537: LOC Inactive Date is blank, Next pmt due date is missing, Payment amt is missing

Letter 538: No letter template provided



Can they provide new data with these issues addressed as well as the template for 538? Once I get it I can generate the complete samples.



For now, I can attach what I have if they want to review letters 532, 534, and 536 first.[^sefcdl027_incomplete_sample.pdf]


author: dyuen
comment: [~thomasY], thanks. I will have SEFCU review what you've produced so far and check on the data for the other letters after QA reviews.

[~Igor.Khosid]FYI


author: dyuen
comment: Disregard above comment. I forwarded the samples that we have now and am waiting on feedback about the letters that have data issues.


author: billr
comment: [~thomasY]

Customer responded to the samples:

Well Daphne, the samples look bad. I dont understand why 531 and 532 would have issues with the data as those are already being generated by InfoImage. If I just look at one piece, like the "Inactive Date" missing or not correct. Could you give me the info that is used for programming 531 and 532 currently in production environment (prior to this request)? I'm guessing something was dropped when they became a part of this request. But I am not sure.

The business owner waited a long time for samples and manual letters are increasing a lot. I would like to get them some sort of info as to what is needed to get these working correctly.

I know you will assist me and look forward to getting this worked out. Please let me know when you have the info that is being used now to program 531 and 532 aka notice #27 in the production environment.

comment: Hi [~thomasY], please see updated templates/test files. They all end with "_06132022"

Per SEFC: "FISERV is still working on getting me samples for letter #533 and #535. The other 6 are attached #531, #532, #534, #536, #537, #538."


author: dyuen
comment: [~thomasY], I finally got the remaining 2. Please let me know when you have new samples ready or if you need anything else.

Thanks


author: dyuen
comment: [~thomasY], please advise to when you will have samples ready.

comment: [~dyuen]Samples are attached.[^sefcdl027.pdf]


author: dyuen
comment: Updated samples forwarded to SEFC. Pending feedback/approval.


author: dyuen
comment: [~thomasY], please see below feedback from SEFC:

"I met with the Business Owner last night. The variables on the samples look good. However, due to a recent decision to discontinue our offering of a Home Equity Loan we need to adjust letter #532, #534, #536.

There is a line in the last paragraph of all 3 of these that says "If you are interested in additional opportunities to access the equity in your home, you may apply for a new Home Equity*{color:#FF0000}Loan or{color}*Line of Credit ....".

We would like to remove the words '*{color:#FF0000}Loan or{color}*'. That will change that line to read -'If you are interested in additional opportunities to access the equity in your home, you may apply for a new Home Equity Line of Credit...'

Is that change possible? "

author: dyuen
comment: [~TunA], thanks! SEFC is still reviewing, I did provide them the updated sample [~thomasY]provided yesterday. Pending response/approval.


author: dyuen
comment: [~thomasY], please see below feed back form SEFC:

"The Business Owner has noticed there appears to be a size limitation in the salutation line. It may not be critical, it was only noticed on one account. Do we control the size of that field? I will attach an example. The letter "n" is missing in the members last name. Please let me know. Thank you. djb"

[~eric.yan]----Descriptions in the e-notice in Infotrac stage does not match with SOW.


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~gthillaivel] The description in the SOW is 'HELOC Draw Reminder Letter (6 Months Out)', which is what we have in our database for letter code 027. All of the letters in the index file are letter 027. I checked a few accounts on infotrac stage acct management and I am seeing the above description I mentioned.


author: gthillaivel
comment: [~dyuen][~thomasY]
[~Shun.Kuwashima]-Even though letter is 027 , it contains various letters and the description should be different as per SOW
 !screenshot-4.png|thumbnail! 


author: thomasy
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima]We are adding additional templates to letter 027. They will all be HELOC Draw Reminder Letters.

[~dyuen]Can you update letter 027 name in the SoW


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~thomasY] [~dyuen] [~gthillaivel] Fyi anything posted with letter code 027 will have the description 'HELOC Draw Reminder Letter (6 Months Out)'. We cannot apply different descriptions for the same letter code. 


author: dyuen
comment: [~thomasY] [~Shun.Kuwashima], the SOW is up to date. I added letter codes 049 - 056 for these letters.

!image-2022-08-01-12-51-34-032.png!


author: thomasy
comment: [~dyuen]Are we treating all of them as different letters? It is my understanding that they would all be treated as 1 letter with 7 variations based on the job description.


author: dyuen
comment: [~thomasY], that's what we were originally going to do, but I remember when I spoke with [~TunA]once, we would need to create new codes for these letters because
 # If anything comes up/arises with these letters in the future, we would be able to do research/prevent any confusion
 # SEFC would also be able to see what letter they're referring to since they're going from 1 letter with 2 or 3 variations to 7 distinct letters/letter codes


author: thomasy
comment: [~dyuen]Ok, I'll split them all into their own letter codes then, but are we keeping the original letter 27 or are we using 050? Currently notice code 532 is linked with 027.


author: gthillaivel
comment: [~Jessica][~dyuen][~Igor.Khosid]

[~thomasY]--Any updates?

comment: [~dyuen]Do you have an answer about the account number masking yet? BT-113


author: dyuen
comment: [~thomasY], not yet. I did follow up on the ticket. The contact for this project is OOO until next week. I'll check in again on Monday with them.


author: dyuen
comment: [~thomasY], SEFC responded witht he following regrading masking:

"The Business Owner has responded and advised me to unmask the same as we usually do. Can you confirm that we usually have the last 3 digits viewable?"

I checked production samples in InfoTRAC and we leave 3 digits unmasked. OK to leave as is.
