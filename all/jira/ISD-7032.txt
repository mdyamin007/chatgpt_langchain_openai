comment: [~Andrey.Kutsenko] I'm pending a response from Tevis to see if there are any resources we need to upload.

comment: Hi [~Tevis Mak], resource is uploaded now.

Both index files posted successfully on pilot. However, one of the files dla_20220516_1_20220517_1252_acbk.txt errored on stage, see below:

java.lang.Exception: infoTrac_flag is on but dt_job_id is missing from dataTrac(IS) database

Can you take a look and see if anything is missing?


author: JIRAUSER11401
comment: Hi [~Shun.Kuwashima],

new dt_job_id is added and here are the new index files:

DLA032:
[^dla_20220215_1_20220519_1302_acbk.txt]
DLA033:
[^dla_20220516_1_20220519_1325_acbk.txt]

comment: Hi [~Tevis Mak],

I got the same error again for the new DLA032 index file this time. However, technically we do have a successful file for both DLA032 and 033, is that fine? Below are the successful postings on stage:

DLA032: 999999-C01.01-V22236 - dla_20220215_1_20220517_1458_acbk.txt -- acct 7109652
DLA033: 133508-C01.01-V22236 - dla_20220516_1_20220519_1325_acbk.txt -- acct 31378

comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] FYI
The right part of the last paragraph is missing from the disclosure. 
I checked:
DLA032: 999999-C01.01-V22236 - dla_20220215_1_20220517_1458_acbk.txt  acct 7109652
DLA033: 133508-C01.01-V22236 - dla_20220516_1_20220519_1325_acbk.txt  acct 31378

comment: [~Tevis Mak] I double checked our resource servers for S1ACBKDL.300 and it's there. Is there perhaps another resource file that we need to upload?


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~Tevis Mak] Sorry, maybe I should rephrase. Since the text on the bottom right seems to be cutoff, I was wondering if there was an issue with the resource you provided me and if so whether I need to update any resources on my end. Can you check if this is a resource related issue or something else on your side? I'd suggest maybe reaching out to Peter/Yamee or someone else on IS if you're not sure. Thanks

comment: [~MattL] [~Andrey.Kutsenko] We just needed to update the resource file, I checked both letters 032 and 033 and I can see the bottom right portion now on infotrac stage account management.
