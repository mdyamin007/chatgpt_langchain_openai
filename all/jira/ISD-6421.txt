comment: Hi Shun,

Customer responded to the pilot site:

Hi Bill, thank you for keeping an eye on her cases. We currently do not have a way to see the pilot site because we have an SSO through NCR to the production site. If you can get us into the pilot site that would be great! If not, can you send us some screenshots (securely) of a few accounts? Thanks, Dan

comment: [~billr], I've attached screenshots of the pilot site for those 3 users I mentioned above. !pfcu_pilot_1.PNG|thumbnail!  !pfcu_pilot_2.PNG|thumbnail!  !pfcu_pilot_3.PNG|thumbnail!

Customer responded:

Hi Bill, the new location looks good to us, please let me know when you think it will be in production. Some things to note:

- There is a 'Pittsford Federal Credit Union' label in bold at the top of your drop-down list which does not appear on our production site. We just wanted to confirm that the label will not appear on our production site when this change goes live.

- What dictates the order of the menu options? Is there is hidden number assigned to the menu item behind the scenes or is it sorted on something else?

Thanks!

Dan

comment: [~billr] Thanks, I'll try to release this onto stage today for QA to review.

To answer their questions:
* The label should not appear on production, I only updated the account type sorting list.
* There is a number value for each account type whereas the Tax Forms type is the last value.

comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid]

I made an update to the SSO site to make the Tax Forms acct type show at the bottom of the list. Please test on SSO stage, below are instructions:

* Use the SSO test page to login on stage. Should be straightforward, here's a few user_fi_numbers you can use to test: 110356, 67737, 10104
* Once logged in, you should see a green acct dropdown list on the right side.
* Click on it and it should show all of that user's accts. You should see a Tax Forms acct as the last item, there should not be any accts below that.

Thanks,
Shun

comment: Shun, can this go live today?

comment: [~billr] I think I can release it this afternoon, I'll provide another update later today.

comment: [~billr] This should be released to production now, can we have the client confirm? Users may need to clear their cache and try again if they don't see the change immediately.
