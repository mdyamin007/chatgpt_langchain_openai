how about the enoice tab? this is a daily letter.


author: berezinez
comment: [~eric.yan]

Stage posting doesn't show a new insert, should it be there? or a new insert on the print samples only?

comment: [~berezinez] [~eric.yan], not sure if this would help but please note that this letter gets generated in print regardless of member's delivery preference. What is shown in the PDF in Alis' comment is a paper member who will get a physical printed insert that the client sent us, while only members who have an electronic delivery preference will get the in-line insert.

"This letter is set up to ignore what we call a paperless file. The paperless file contains eStatement members. Therefore, if there are eStatement members in the data file, they will get a paper notice in addition to the electronic notice. This is where I mentioned some members, specifically, electronic members will get 2 inserts.

+Example+, member 123 is an electronic member and is in the paperless file. This member will get a paper and electronic Escrow Analysis letter. If we continue with the in-line insert development, this member will get a black and white printed insert, as well as the color insert (shipped) you sent us.

When member 123 logs into online banking to look at the escrow analysis letter, they will also see the in-line insert which continues after the notice."

The insert is selective, so not everyone member would have it. Could you try the following account?

97550

107860

76130


author: berezinez
comment: [~eric.yan]

there are no enotices for these accounts. please check with ISD.

Hi Shun, could you help update the dates for these member numbers? It's a selective insert, so not all members will have the insert.

97550

107860

76130

[~berezinez]

please check again after [~Shun.Kuwashima] finish updating.

comment: [~eric.yan] [~Shun.Kuwashima]

The checklist is attached for parallel test once QA could be completed.


author: dyuen
comment: [~eric.yan] [~berezinez] [~TunA] [~Jessica], would there be any risk if we don't do parallel for this update?

Let me know if I should set up a quick call to discuss

Thanks

comment: [~dyuen]

We could launch parallel now.


author: dyuen
comment: [~eric.yan] [~Shun.Kuwashima]I created masterparallel #26207. I'm checking with OPS if we have time for parallel.

Thanks


author: william.kong
comment: Per summary from [~TunA]and [~eric.yan], we will run this in production so that client can review production samples instead of parallel. [~dyuen]is in agreement with this plan.



[~eric.yan]: Please release this code now as discussed.


author: dyuen
comment: Note: [~eric.yan]confirmed via Zoom that code was released. We will close out the Jira after client approves production samples and parallel passes.

Thanks!


author: eric.yan
comment: Code is released.
