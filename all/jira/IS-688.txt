comment: [~zhuoxinT]: Please prioritize to work on this project. We missed getting this turned over to your when it was created on 12/21 instead of the schedule turnover date of 12/17. There are+two+ release dates.



[~Kbittmann]/[~yameelee]: I spoke with [~yameelee]. We missed turning this project over. But based on YaMee's research, this job does not cycle until mid month. So we would request to get the first live dated updated. Please discuss to get an agreed upon live.



[~Kbittmann]: Where are the messages/resources needed for Zhuoxin to work on the coding. I do not see it in this Jira ticket. Please advise ASAP so that we do not delay this project further!
