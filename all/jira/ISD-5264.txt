comment: Deconversion Specs:
Run in two batches:
 # August 2020 - May 2021
 # May 2021 - September 2021

If Batch 1 finish fast, and Batch 2 can be done shortly, do both.

Zips should be by statement type by month-year, i.e. every month should be a zip for each statement type.

CFCU should not have any enotices or etaxes (please double check).

Here should be all the statement types: default, heloc, visa, visa_gold, visa_plat (please also doubel check).
