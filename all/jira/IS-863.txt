title: IVBK: eNotice Setup (Resume project)
description: 

Resume project started with JEF #47835 for IVBK setup for print notices and HTML eNotices for Ivy Bank.

UPDATE: There will be a total of 3 notices for setup.

Please confirm if we should re-number the notice codes 001 - 003, or keep the ones you have in place - reference last page of the SOW for total list:
|*INFO Code*|*Letter Name*|*Client File*|
|001|Notice of Overdrawn Account|1342.MMDD.#######.DP-OVDFT.STM.pgp|
|-002 / 007-|-Late Charge notice-|-1342.MMDD.#######.LN-LCHG.STM.pgp-|
|003|Advances Notice of CD Maturity|1342.MMDD.#######.TD_NOTE.STM.pgp|
|-004 / 009-|-Certificate Renewal Notice-|-1342.MMDD.#######.TD_RENNT.STM.pgp-|
|-005 / 018-|-Dormant Notice-|-1342.MMDD.#######.PS_DPIUD.STM.pgp-|
|006|NSF|1342.MMDD.#######.CK_NSFNT.STM.pgp|



See attached 'APPROVED' mockups.

Files will arrive as 'CAMB' data; InfoIMAGE will replace CAMB information with IVBK information as noted in the mockups.

Test files attached for each of the notice types.



Here is the updated SOW:

[http://sharepoint-svr/AS/Shared%20Documents/SOW%20Directory/CAMB%20-%20Cambridge%20Bank%20(OSI)/_IVBK%20-%20Ivy%20Bank%20(Child%20CID%20of%20CAMB)/IVBK_DN_PRINT%20SOW.docx]



Electronic SOW:

can you provide the list of 4 notices, their mapping and sow?


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~tohidulI] I will provide today, sorry for the delay!


author: tohiduli
comment: Hi [~phoebe.george]

did you update the sow and mapping?


author: tohiduli
comment: Hi[~phoebe.george]

should we keep the enotice account type empty for letter 3 and 6? if we keep this empty then esup by paperless file will not apply for letter 3 and 6.

comment: [~tohidulI] Sorry, I missed updating that, I will provide the Account Type on the updated list.

Also, I had meant to attach the mockups and test files, but i got behind last week. I'll prepare this now and provide an update.

Thanks!

[^ivbkdl003.pdf]

There was no data file for letter 006 in ftpbu folder. There was a file named1342.0424.1379268.TD_RENNT.STM.pgp, but in the Jira description and sow it is now discarded. Any suggestion?

author: phoebe.george
comment: [~tohidulI] Sorry again for all my delays! Thank you for creating these, for the Notice 003, the following updates would need to be done as well.

It will be similar to what was done for 001 where we "replace" the existing CAMB info to use IVBK contact info in these 3 areas, highligted below:

Phone number changed to:

855.489.2265

Email address changed to:

[ivyinfo@ivybank.com|mailto:ivyinfo@ivybank.com]



I'll request a test file for the last one needed, which is: CK_NSFNT.STM. This should be in production now, and would require the same phone number and email address change.


We will not be setting up the TD_RENNT.STM notice at this time (crossed out for notice 004). Thank you!

Also for Notice 003, please replace: cambridgesavings.com with: ivybank.com

Hi [~phoebe.george] 

attached letter 003 sample also.



can you update the live date?


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~tohidulI] Thank you! I updated the live date for now to 5/31, but can change it if you believe we should move up or later on. Separately, CAMB is reviewing the samples, but believe all should be good.

This setup is slightly different where we are posting these notices in HTML format, rather than PDF. Are you aware how to do this, as we post their IVBK DDA in HTML right now. Please let me know if not, and I can have IS managers review with you what needs to be done to prepare the index files for ISD to post. Thank you!


author: tohiduli
comment: Hi [~phoebe.george]



should we set account type "DD" for letter 003 and 006 same as letter 001?


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~tohidulI] Is it possible to confirm what we use for CAMB for these account types? They should actually mirror that. I was trying to locate the specs for how we determine notice account type in the CAMB DN SOW, but could not locate! I actually believe we pull it from their CIF file. Let me know if you can see that in the CAMB setup, but I am also checking the original setup as well to see if I can confirm too since it doesn't seem to be documented!



Thanks,

Phoebe

comment: Hi [~phoebe.george]

CAMB Advances Notice of CD Maturity(letter 008) uses "TD" and NSF(letter 003) uses "DD"


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~tohidulI] Thanks for confirming! Please use the same Account Types to mirror CAMB setup for these notices. They are using the same data/account type structure from their core.

Thank you!


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~tohidulI] Here are the feedback updates for the notice samples:
 # Letter 001 (OD Reminder) - remove disclosure for all accounts.
 # Letter 003 (Cert Maturity) - please check page 20 of the sample. There is some shifting in the coupon that needs to be adjusted.
 # Letter 003 (Cert Maturity) - there is one more phone number in paragraph 3 that needs a phone number update as well - need to be updated to use: 855.489.2265:

comment: [~Peter.Dang]/[~tohidulI]: Per our scrum meeting today. [~Peter.Dang]needs to review this project again to see how Tohid can update the Print DFA "PRESENTMENTTYPE" variable w/o hard coding. There is a global design concern that needs to be discussed internally on what the best process is.



+Possibly+ may consider passing in an ENVIRONMENT variable to the processing program via isisdisk_daily.sh and control file approach.



[~tohidulI]: For now, please update eqbkdla.control to use "PRESENTMENTTYPE=HTML"




author: william.kong
comment: [~tohidulI]: CORRECTION. Please use lowercase presentmenttype="HTML" in the control file. I noticed most environment variables in control file is lower case, so going to be consistent with that.






author: tohiduli
comment: Hi [~Peter.Dang]

did you update the isisdisk_daily.sh script to pass the presentmenttype as ENVIRONMENT variable?


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~tohidulI] I received approval on the latest samples. When you are ready to generate an HTML index file test, please let me know and we can work with ISD to post to pilot. Thanks!


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~tohidulI] Any updates on being able to create an index file for eNotice posting? Thanks!


author: william.kong
comment: [~tohidulI]: [~Peter.Dang]help update the isisdisk_daily.sh in parallel with the presentmenttype variable. can you test your code to see if it produces HTML? Just a reminder, you need to define presentmenttype variable in your control as we discussed 3 weeks ago.






author: phoebe.george
comment: [~tohidulI] We received this newer production files for Letter Code 001 and 003. 

1342.0521.1391522.DP-OVDFT.STM.pgp (cycle 21) - can you provide the sample for Account Number 11456036

1342.0518.1389998.TD_NOTE.STM.pgp (cycle 18) - can you provide sample for Account Number 11362340


If you are able to use these two cycles for posting to pilot, that would be good for final client signoff.


Thanks,

Phoebe




author: william.kong
comment: [~tohidulI]: Please confirm if you were able to process the file mentioned by [~phoebe.george]above. I also want to confirm if the html is outputting. We did not have time in this week's scrum meeting to discuss this project.



[~phoebe.george]: 5/31 live date for sure will not be achievable. Please let us if client will escalate if we do not meet the 5/31 live date. 


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~William.Kong] [~tohidulI] The live date will need to be shifted. Please let me know once you are able to prepare the e-index file for HTML posting and I'll factor that into an updated timeline.


author: william.kong
comment: [~tohidulI]: Please advise status on your testing. Would like to see if the global code change we made is working. If so, we will need to provide a revised timeline.

comment: [~tohidulI] ISD was able to post the index file that the HTML in general looks good! However, it is missing the logo/form. Do you need to provide updated resources to [~Shun.Kuwashima] also to load to pilot?

Thanks!

I provided the logo in the isd ticket6513, and shun uploaded the resources. please check.

comment: Hi [~phoebe.george]

just to confirm, is the stock code 4000?

does this project use e-form?






author: phoebe.george
comment: [~tohidulI] Yes, for print, the stock code will be plain white for 4000.

I believe based on the logo/footer, it will be referenced as an e-form. Is this how you incorporated the logo/return address and footer for the notices?


author: tohiduli
comment: Hi [~phoebe.george]

No, I am currently assuming there is no eform. currently the footer has "3529" at the end this need to be removed if the stock code is 4000.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~tohidulI] Can I request your help to generate some additional samples for IVBK notices - just a set of PDF samples would be fine.

I have attached a zipped file containing several production files for the TD_NOTE data for various cycle dates. There is a list of account numbers below that the bank would like to see for the IVBK notices - are you able to produce? They will actually be reviewing to possibly send out to the customer directly. If easier, let me know if you prefer just to send one large PDF for each of the cycles and I can extract the account numbers accordingly:
|Cycle Date|Account Number|
|5/18/2022|11362340|
|6/12/2022|11370450|
|6/18/2022|11372711|

Here is the file name attached with the data files:

Thanks for your help!

comment: Also, please keep the stock code footer with '3529' - I forgot that you used the embedded resource, rather than an e-form, which is fine.

comment: As per Phoebe - reverting to in progress


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~tohidulI] There is one more part of this setup that we need to discuss further to extract out the IVBK accounts from the CAMB data file.

The bank sends a daily file identifying IVBK accounts and we need to extract to use for processing; file name is called: ivbk_xref_acct_MMDDYYYY_HHMMSS.txt.pgp



Sorry, this was noted on the original JEF ticket, but did not get transferred to this Jira when we re-initiated the project.

This is similar to what we do for IVBK DDA statements. Would it be best to setup a call with Peter to discuss how this would be handled?




author: rony
comment: Hi [~phoebe.george]



So from these 3 data files:

1342.MMDD.#######.DP-OVDFT.STM.pgp
1342.MMDD.#######.TD_NOTE.STM.pgp
1342.MMDD.#######.CK_NSFNT.STM.pgp

we should only process those accounts matched withivbk_xref_acct_MMDDYYYY_HHMMSS.txt.pgp ? And rest of the accounts we should suppressed from print+enotice+archival?

Would you please provide us sample xref file and updated sow. And what if the xref file is missing ? Should we abort the process?



[~tohidulI]



Thanks

Rony




author: phoebe.george
comment: [~rony] [~tohidulI] I talked to Peter about this, and we have a similar process in place for IVBK DDA where we extract the data from the CAMB DDA file based on this account listing - I have noted the latest production file received below - it is received daily at 5:15am PST.

ivbk/ivbk_xref_acct_07192022_080007.txt.pgp

This file arrives daily - if it is missing, it is fine to keep the previous day's cycle to use for current days notice files for processing.





Separately [~tohidulI] Can I request if you can provide PDF's for additional samples? CAMB is sending these PDF's out manually to the IVBK clients until we can get the IVBK notices in place for production.

author: phoebe.george
comment: [~rony] [~tohidulI] The bank is hoping to go live as soon as we are able to update the script to identify the IVBK accounts. What live date is realistic to finish the script for this, since the customer has already approved the pilot site itself. Can we go live at the beginning of August?
