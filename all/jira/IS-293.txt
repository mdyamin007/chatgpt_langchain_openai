comment: Hi [~dyuen],

Notice code 048 is correct for this new notice.

comment: Hi [~dyuen],

The test data file have a "Member Number" and "List of Account Numbers" field. The member number field has 1 number while the list of account numbers can have multiple numbers. For enotice posting which one am I suppose to use? Majority of the existing letter cross reference from account number to primary account number, but since this file can have multiple account number it's not possible to determine which one to use. Wouldit be okay to post enotice to number in the "Member Number" field?

comment: Hi [~jun], please see below feedback from SEFC:

eNotices: We are fine with using member number

As far as the samples are concerned, two things -

1. The phone number format for our member solutions center appears to be incorrect, can that please be changed to:

(800) 727-3328

2. On page 252, the notice is showing no accounts when the member has 7 inactive in the data file. I'm guessing the space for this list isn't coded to support that many?

Thanks,

Attached new PDF samples "sefcdl048_Samples_082021.pdf"

The account on page 252 have the list of account number on a separate line. Customer will need to fix the data by placing the account number on same line as "List of Account Numbers |" field.



Here is index file. Please ask ISD to add the new notice description.

Index file:dlc_20210712_1_20210820_0936_sefc.txt

comment: Hi [~jun], please see below feedback regarding the account on page 252.

-----

The list is too long to be in the same position as the "List of Account Numbers" tag. It seems that this is occurring anytime there are more than 4 accounts.

I can see if I can move all of them to be below the "List of Account Numbers" tag for consistency but I wouldn't be able to do what the programmer is asking.

Can you check with them to see if that would be okay? I can work on getting a test file.

------

Can you confirm?

Thanks!

comment: Hi [~dyuen], Ya that will work. I will make the update when the new test file arrives.

comment: [~gthillaivel] [~tye.wu@infoimageinc.com] ,

Not sure what is the error on PUI. There was an older index file for the same letter that posted successfully on PUI. Tye, do you know what is that error?

Gnana,

I just "undo" the processed index file.

The problem: Index file should be processed "Document Processing" but not "AFP"

Please check it is good now
