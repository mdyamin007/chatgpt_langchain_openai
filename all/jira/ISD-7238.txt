comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] just FYI:

ALFC confirmed that they prefer not to launch at EOM, and have requested that we complete code release for this update on 7/6 instead.

Thanks!

comment: Thanks [~phoebe.george]! There shouldn't be anything needed to release from ISD since AOLP is already disabled for all the apps mentioned in the description, so I think we're good to close this story when IS releases their updates.
