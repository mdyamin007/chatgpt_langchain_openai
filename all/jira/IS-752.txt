comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] 

I found below data files in test folder:

SURU_FORD_stmt_033122_023028.txt
SURU_FORD_stmt_033122_024510.txt
SURU_FORD_stmt_033122_104333.txt
SURU_FORD_stmt_033122_114747.txt

samples for those are:

SURU_FORD_stmt_033122_023028.txt -[^surums71318.pdf]
SURU_FORD_stmt_033122_024510.txt -[^surums72018.pdf]
SURU_FORD_stmt_033122_104333.txt -[^surums73028.pdf]
SURU_FORD_stmt_033122_114747.txt -[^surums73038.pdf]



And about s3 cloud push, I had to rename those data files since the dates are the same 0333122 the archival files would replace each other. So I rename those files like below before processing:

SURU_FORD_stmt_033122_023028.txt -> not renamed
SURU_FORD_stmt_033122_024510.txt -> SURU_FORD_stmt_040122_024510.txt
SURU_FORD_stmt_033122_104333.txt -> SURU_FORD_stmt_040222_104333.txt
SURU_FORD_stmt_033122_114747.txt -> SURU_FORD_stmt_040322_114747.txt

So the client should see the archival sample with those below dates in archival file names:
033122
040122
040222
040322
