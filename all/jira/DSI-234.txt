title: 6594 - IVBK / CAMB - new sub client CID for CAMB
description: Hi [~rifat.mahmud],

CAMB will have a new sub CID similar to FCBT called IVBK, Ivy Bank.
 * We will need to create a new client setup on hypercube for IVBK.
 * CAMB SSO will still be on prism, but IVBK will be on hypercube.
 * We will need to move both CAMB and IVBK onto infotrac with a new parent CID for both. I will update you when I am told what that parent CID is called.

Attached is SOW. Can you start development with the specs given from the SOW.

Hi [~Bryant.Tran],

From SOW I saw that IVBK will have Auth process.What other processes will be there for IVBK?

Thanks.

h6. Hi [~Bryant.Tran] ,after going through the SOW some queries have been raised.Please take a look at the listed points below:

1.In the SOW it has been mentioned ,*Remove Enrollment Step 3 * *Account Preferences; all accounts will default to Electronic delivery preference.*Could you please elaborate this point as how will the 3rd step of enrollment be handled in this case(for selective paperless module)

2.As per my understanding according to the SOW, there will be 6 statement types(listed in the table). And the account types areCK, SV, TD, LN, CK 401.Please correct me If I am wrong
|h6. DDA/Savings Statements|
|h6. Account Analysis Statements|
|h6. IRA Statements|
|h6. Annual Escrow Analysis Statements|
|h6. LOC (HELOC) Statements|
|h6. Mortgage Notices|

3.As per my assumption the ones listed in the below table are Enotice types. If so ,could you please provide the Enotice codes?
|h6. 1|h6. Safe Deposit Box (Rent/Auto)|
|h6. 2|h6. Safe Deposit Box (Drill/Late)|
|h6. 3|h6. NSF Notices|
|h6. 4|h6. Escrow Payoff Letter|
|h6. 5|h6. Frequent Overdraft Fees|
|h6. 6|h6. Notice of Overdrawn Account|
|h6. 7|h6. Late Charge notice|
|h6. 8|h6. Advances Notice of CD Maturity|
|h6. 9|h6. Certificate Renewal Notice|
|h6. 10|h6. Delinquency Notice|
|h6. 11|h6. Mortgage Rate Change Notice|
|h6. 12|h6. Rate Change Notice|
|h6. 13|h6. Retirement RMD|
|h6. 15|h6. BBM Receipt Notice|
|h6. 16|h6. Investment Transaction Notice|
|h6. 17|h6. PMI Notice|
|h6. 18|h6. Dormant Notice|
|h6. CK 401|h6. Wire Notices (PDF Daily Notice)|

4. As per SOW,customer will not be able to update their email address through the Profile Tab; this is hosted in Online Banking and passed through SSO. Will admin be able to update email address via INFOTRAC?

5.For selective paperless, in profile page viewable will be Default and Enotice so,will all the statement types mentioned above under point no. "2" follow default?

6.Also for setup we will be needing:
 a. Color schemes, gif images, logos. 
 b. Disclosure page /contents. 
 c. Reconciliation/Billing Rights Summary page in pdf format
h6. Thank you for taking your time to review these queries.

comment: Hi Samiha,

Here are some answers:
 # We won't be removing step 3, just they are forced into electronic when enrolling.
 ## Also, is it possible to have the email not editable, but sms editable? Do we need to develop that?
 # I've attached an updated SOW with account types mapping to which statement.
 # The number on the left would be the enotice code. See new updated SOW.
 # Let me get back to you on this issue.
 # I know as of now, we will have default and enotice. Let me confirm if we need a loan selective paperless option.
 # I have colors, but i need to find out which is primary and secondary. I will get back to you on this.

comment: Hi [~Bryant.Tran] ,after a discussion with the team the answer to"Is it possible to have the email not editable, but sms editable? Do we need to develop that?" is, *yesit is possible to have the email not editable, but sms editable*.

Also there are a couple of things we need to be clear about .These are listed below:
 # Will the auth process of IVBK follow CAMB auth process? Or there will be any customization? If it follows CAMB auth process, then will we use CambFinAcctDesc.java for account type descriptions?
 # Will IVBK use doc process for default statements and enotice?
 # Which backend process and reports will be there for IVBK?

Could you please provide some feedback? Thank you.

comment: Hi [~Samiha_Seraj],
 # Yes the AUTH process will follow the CAMB auth process. They asked for us to have the AUTH file one file, but have a bank code to differentiate IVBK and CAMB. I will get back to you on the test file for that.
 # Yes, IVBK will use doc processing for statements and eNotice.
 # I will get back to you on that. I know as of now, all the default reports we have on infotrac, as well ass the Email Address Collection Report.

For the previous topics,

   5. Selective paperless - There will be only two options for selective paperless for the setup. default and enotice. We are not setting up loans/mortgages yet.

Thank you

The primary color will be#39B53F and secondary color will be#95C04C.

Hi[~Bryant.Tran],

Is there any update about IVBK Auth and ECL process? We need file format for IVBK Auth and ECL process.

Thanks

comment: Hi [~mamunur.rashid] and [~Samiha_Seraj],

We are still waiting for their AUTH test files. The client does not have ECL processing, so the only location to change the email is through InfoTRAC or SSO.

For now, where are we for the SSO login? I believe there is a pilot date of 6/15. We just need the site to be able to log in via SSO as the main priority.

Can we get the code up by 6/10 for basic SSO logic so I can test and set up the proxies for the SSO login?

Hi [~Bryant.Tran],

As IVBK will use NCR, we need certificate.crt and private.pem file related to NCR. Can you tell us how to generate SAML Response?

We also need logo and verbiage for disclosure section of ivbk.

Thanks.

Hi[~Bryant.Tran],

What we have done so far:
 # Set up IVBK on hypercube and committed the code to trunk.
 # Used NCR as default sso method.
 # Set up schema for IVBK on pilot_bank. (ORGANIZATION, ORG_DOC_TYPE, AUTHENTICATOR, USR_SESSION, AUDIT_LOG_IVBK)



What we couldnt do:
 # As we couldnt generate SAML Response so we couldnt test NCR.
 # As of now, we couldnt find a way to generate SAMLResponse from our end, this NCR SSO was tested using the SAMLResponse we got from the vendor request for NECU. We can have that from the log file after the vendor test SSO. Once we have that SAMLResponse we can do further tests using that.
 # Enabling SSO for ivbk in pilot-infoservice.



I think you might need to provide the vendor the following link as destination url after setting up the hypercube in pilot -

[https://ivbkpilot.infoimageinc.com/ssoOneWayLogin/ncr]

After that can you please take that SAML Response from the log and send it to us so that we can do further testing?

N.B: As we were not provided client specific files like logo.gif, disclosure.pdf, verbiage for disclosure section so I set it up using generic files (from demo client).

Thanks.

Hi [~Bryant.Tran],

I figured out how to generate SAMLResponse to test NCR for IVBK.

In hypercube, the following method is used for NCR:
 # A 16-bit secret key is used to encode the user and account information (xml) usingAES-CBC method. To do that a 16-bit initialization vector is used.
 # After AES-CBC encryption the encrypted text and initialization vector is again encoded using base64 encoding method.
 # The secret key is encoded using RSA-OAEP algorithm. And the encoded secret key is again encoded using base64 encoding method.
 # At the final step, an xml is created using RSA-OAEP public key, encrypted user and account information and encrypted secret key. This xml is encoded using base64 encoding to generate SAMLResponse.

Will IVBK follow the same procedure to generate SAML Response? Please let me know.

Thanks.
