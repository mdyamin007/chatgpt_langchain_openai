Just double checking, the inline insert logic is for archival and estmt?

For paper, we will be using the insert machine, so no coding is required for paper, correct?

This will be an inline insert for print, e, and archival.


author: william.kong
comment: [~jira_naru]& [~Kbittmann]: My apologies. The teamsupport ticket was clear to include inline insert for PDF archival and eStatements, I just forgot to notate that in the IS assessment when I was evaluating it. I will update the description of work above now in red. Thanks for bringing this up [~jira_naru]! Great work!

For the paper, insert, I strongly recommend using the insert machine to stuff the insert. If you do it programmatically for paper, we need to modify the print module to handle a 4th tray for the insert. This will require more programming time and testing.

Given the tight timeline, I do not recommend progamming the inline insert for paper but instead use the insert machine.


author: william.kong
comment: [~Kbittmann]: Please review [~jira_naru]'s concern above and discuss with Tina to see if we an get this situated and ordered ASAP.



This will mean a permanent paper insert.


author: william.kong
comment: [~Kbittmann]: Can you advise on the request [~jira_naru]is suggesting. It is a strong recommendation for a more turn key solution. Please advise so we not lose time continuing this project. [~jira_naru]is working on the PDF archival and eStatement portion as we speak but need an answer soon on this.

The client is looking for this to be an inline insert.


author: jira_naru
comment: [~Kbittmann]and [~William.Kong]:

Yes, the client will get the inline insert for estmt and archival.

However, we do not have to 'inline' the insert for print because you can use the insert machine to stuff the insert into the envelop.


author: william.kong
comment: [~Jessica]: Per my zoom message just now, please ensure [~Kbittmann]gives us a response to this. [~jira_naru]explained that this is a custom print module; This custom print module was to handle their paper trays for the check pages. Adding the inline insert logic for Print will be extremely risky. We did not release this was a custom print module at the time of assessing. Please advise if we can arrange with OPS to have this as a physical insert moving forward.

Please move forward with physical inserts printed members and inline inserts for electronic members and archival.


author: william.kong
comment: [~Kbittmann]: Because of the internal communication delays on the physical inserts, i will move the live date to 12/28.

What are the new sample and sample approval dates?


author: jira_naru
comment: [~Kbittmann]:

For sample just have DP run the Monthly Stmt validation file so that we can post to PILOT.


author: jira_naru
comment: [~Kbittmann]and QA:

First round will be the validation file that DP will process and post to PILOT.

QA pass, the changes look good, please send for CU approval.



**after approval please request laser samples in CA and provide an Index file for Stage posting.[^diff.txt]

Samples approved. Please provide info for print samples per Alis's request.


author: jira_naru
comment: [~Kbittmann]and [~berezinez]:

There is no update to the logic for print regarding the insert because the insert will be handle by the insert machine. The insert for print is HARD insert not programmatically. So, print sample would just be transparent to current production.


author: berezinez
comment: [~Kbittmann] [~jira_naru]

Please attach approved samples.


author: berezinez

is there any update on the approved samples? please attach them.

I see what Nar commented.

and I also see your comment 4 days ago -Samples approved. what samples were approved? I don't see any pdf samples attached, Please attach approved samples.

comment: [~jira_naru]

do we need to verify Stage posting? if so please provide an Index file. and resources to ISD.



**I've validated pdf archival - looks good.


author: jira_naru
comment: [~berezinez]:

You do not have to validate Stage posting.

We will do so when we run the parallel. Please move forward and I will get you the QA form shortly.

comment: IS checklist - attached >>>  [^IS-208_IDCU_IS Checklist.pdf] 
As per Nar, we do not have to validate Stage posting, we will do so when we run the parallel


author: jira_naru
comment: Per [~Kbittmann]via ZOOM:

'please ensure we release IDCU code before you leave today regardless if parallel is complete
this has to be live before EOM'

So, code release completed.

Leaving Story open till year end processing and rollback of DFA code are completed.

comment: [~jira_naru]: Thank you for taking care of this!

comment: Nar is monitoring production just to be sure things are ok before closing this ticket out. Most likely today or tomorrow to close this ticket.
