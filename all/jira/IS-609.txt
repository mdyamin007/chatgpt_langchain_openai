comment: [~dawnl]: Looks like samples were provided to client one day late. We will extend approval by no later than EOD 11/29/2021. We need this project released by 11/30/2021 so that it does not go into December towards our code freeze period.

I will update this story to reflect the 11/30/2021 live date.
