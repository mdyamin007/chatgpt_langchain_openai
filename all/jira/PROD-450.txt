To All,

Here is a recap on what we just discuss with Jun.

The Menlo's Production Oracle will be the Primary Oracle in Brisbane. The current Brisbane's Oracle (prod) will be used as the backup.

11/19 - Jun will make the Brisbane's oracle (ca-oracle-pr-01) as the Secondary Database for Menlo. This will take minimum 24 hours to do this.

11/21 12PM PST - Once we disconnect external access, Jun will sync final log and database files to BB (ca-oracle-pr-01).

11/21 12:30 PM PST - Network team can stop the oracle service and shutdown the server.

11/21 3 PM PST - Network team complete IP/Firewall/DNS update, we will bootup the Oracle server and begin testing.

Jun will provide me the Microsoft SQL server that we currently pointing to so that we can confirm the equivalent one in Brisbane.

Thanks
David
