title: InfoTRAC SSO - APCU
description: Would like a single sign on or API for access to InfoTrac without having users sign on each time. Users already have so many logins so anything we can do to simplify would be huge (especially since most staff use InfoTrac sparingly and now their passwords expire and they get locked.... which means contacting InfoImage).
