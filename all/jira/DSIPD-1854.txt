title: Investigation for Job Status omni search 
description: None

comment: [~davidt] As long as we have a finite column name(s) we will not implement any full-text search to support the Omni search behavior in the new Job-status design.

I believe we are pulling data from oracle for estmt jobs and MongoDB for print. For MongoDB, we will search X amount of time on X number of columns and as per our experience, there will be no performance hit. But for Oracle, we will perform one query with a few OR operations and then prepare the data on the server-side. We may introduce lazy loading of each section (ex: account name, then address then number then SSN) sequentially with AJAX if we see any performance issue.
