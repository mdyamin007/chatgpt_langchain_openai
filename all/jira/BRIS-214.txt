title: Port 1433 from 10.4.20.127 to 10.9.1.166
description: [~kent.chan]- Can you please open the port 1433 from 10.4.20.127 (IS Jump Station) to 10.9.1.166 (DDS - TX)? I need to connect form jump station and query DDS_TX database for testing.

FYI - I am able to connect & query DDS (10.4.20.43) w/o any issues.
