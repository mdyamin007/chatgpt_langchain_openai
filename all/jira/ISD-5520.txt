comment: Details - 
 NCR requested to add BKPL and PFCU onto their DI Vendor Usage Report
 NCR provided the id to use for the organizations:

BKPL - 5113

PFCU - 5162

[Work] - 
 In each environment's DB default schema:
 Run these queries:

select * from vendor_org ven, organization org where ven.vendor_name='di' AND ven.org_name=org.org_uniquename;

insert into vendor_org values(vendor_org_id_seq.nextval,'di','bkpl','5113');

insert into vendor_org values(vendor_org_id_seq.nextval,'di','pfcu','5162');

Now, whenever DI Vendor Usage Report is run, NECU will have a record in it.
