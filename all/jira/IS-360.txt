Hi Rony, I'm wondering what's the progress of the job. Do you have any tax form that's ready for QA? QA would like to inspect the tax form once they are ready rather than checking all forms all at once, so that they could better allocate the resources. Please let me know if you need anything.

Could you update the rest of Jack-Henry format tax resources to parallel when available? Thanks.

Please correct the 1042s disclosure as highlighted in the screenshot. The first line of sub text is missing.

comment: Hi [~eric.yan]

Little bit confused here. The left side of the screenshot is code output, right? And the right side is from publication pdf? So what should I do again? Remove or add the line?

I'm still working with QA to confirm, but I think the current form is correct and no need to change.

Could you update the following forms, I couldn't find the resources in parallel.

1098E (no resource)
1099Q (no resource)
1099SA (no resource)
1099OID (no data, no resource)
