CD Transfer & Renew with MJ edits_07152022 Mapping doesnt match pdf samples.

please advise , the sentence:

The remainder of the funds will renew into a <<NEW CERTIFICATE NAME>>. Your new <<NEW CERTIFICATE NAME>> will mature on <<NEW MATURITY DATE>>.

should be there?

Who is from the ISD team assigned to this update?

I cannot post the Index file dlc_20220804_1_20220821_2233_apcu.txt on Stage - getting error -need check dt_job_id....

comment: [~berezinez]

There were no ISD hours quoted, so no team member was assigned to assist with this.  Do we need to open a story for them?


author: berezinez
comment: [~jharvey]

I see Rony provided an Index file, please check with him if we have an eside update. or this update for the paper side only?
