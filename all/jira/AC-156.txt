title: EWBB - [21410][pvt] Update to FC DDA Statements
description: 1. CITY and STATE Fields Combined into Single ENTITYSTATE
- change variable to ent_city_state to use field 6
- change variable to customer_city_state to use field 18



2. Need to update program to check for uppercase "HEADER" to go to next account, because right now the program is looking for "Header" so all the accounts are considered as one account only for the test file.

comment: Per the client on 9/22:

"Our FX Vendor for our FCDDA Statements is currently wrapping up coding efforts in order for us to produce a new file. We are expecting this to occur by late next week or first week of October."

We will revisit the timeline when we receive the new test file.
