title: Hypercube - Fix DSO password hint issue
description: Security Question on DSO reset password page shows based on only "*mfaOnDso*" flag properties. As present business logic, those who have MFA feature will not have a password hint feature. But it should also consider "*dsopasswordhint*" flag. If"*mfaOnDso"* flag feature is false but "*dsopasswordhint*" is true then it will show a security question on the reset password page. But if "*mfaOnDso*" and "*dsopasswordhint*" both flag is false then it will not show security question on the reset password page.
