title: MFCU - [30517][pvt] Member and Credit Card Statement Suppression
description: 1. -Remove mail code matrix suppression.-  Client commented on ticket (comment #10): We do NOT want to remove the mail code suppression.  We want to add the extra suppression for the enrollment file.  This is something I talked to Diego about it.  Right now all credit card and members statement suppression is driven from the symitar data file (eStatement Enable Flag) and the mail code matrix.

2. Install to use paperless suppression.

3. QA/Test.

comment: Hi [~andreav]

Would you please provide us a cycle to run.

New time line:

Dev hour: 4 ( 2 hours for each )
Turnover Date: 05/23/2022
Sample Date: 05/25/2022
Approval Date: 05/27/2022
Live Date: 06/03/2022
Application Names: mfcums1, mfcucc1

parallel required.



In the story description in point 1 it says "Remove mail code matrix suppression."

But from ts [https://app.na3.teamsupport.com/?TicketNumber=27515]comment 10 client said "We do NOT want to remove the mail code suppression.".

So would you please remove point 1 from the description.

Thanks

Per my weekly meetings with MFCU, this unfortunately a lower priority item. I'll keep checking with them on this though.

Due date is also updated.

Thanks!

comment: Hi [~rony], please continue to hold. Ticket #30517 was updated. ISD suggested having MFCU send us the enrollment file at the same time as the data file. If that is successful on their end, I'll close this Jira out.
