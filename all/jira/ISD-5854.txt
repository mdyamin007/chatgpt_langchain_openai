I've posted*ml2_11192020_1_20211216_0935_ewbb.txt* on pilot but since EWBB do not create account from any other application, other than paperless and auth process, no statement has been posted since those accounts do not exist in the database. So we need to process auth application first or setup enotice to create account.

Thanks,

Azad

comment: [~Azad] Thank you! We actually did get an AUTH file for the ML accounts called: EWBB_CIF_HistoricalML_20211208.txt.pgp

Do you have access to this - it was sent to their FTP on 12/10. Let me know if this can be loaded to pilot so that the accounts show up. Thanks!

I do not have access to FTP. Let me know if the AUTH file is moved to PUI pilot server, then I can post both AUTH and ENOTICE one after another.

Thanks,

The client can't send us a new CIF any time soon, so let's just turn on createAccount temporarily for this posting.


Thanks,

comment: [~Azad] I noted on a separate Jira ticket, but EWBB had previously approved the pilot site.

QA is in progress on the IS story. Please prepare your items in preparation for parallel testing, I'll be submitting this once QA is completed.

I will update each of the Jira ISD stories with this same update tied to this project. Thanks!

comment: To QA,

Process _*ml2_20211119_1_20211220_1058_ewbb.txt*_ to test ARM eNotices. ml2 will be processed via Document processing.

Index file and zip file are already on place. Run the job with 'Parallel Run' checked to process on test mode.

For testing purpose, doc process will create account if new.

Thanks!

Verified mortgage notice statements on staging Admin site, no issues

comment: Hi [~phoebe.george],

Code has been released for the Prism and PUI. One thing to keep in mind before posting mortgage is they need to set up an email template from the admin side for the mortgage.



Thanks,

Abdullah
