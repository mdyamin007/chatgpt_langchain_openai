comment: [~shahadet.hossain]- Please note, per William, we will need to enable AOLP via InfoTrac for the first cycle only so the bank can review an approve the first set of samples. Please let me know if you need anything.

Per request please see the below API Strings for obtaining the check images for eStmts. Please program in so we can validate.

Statement:

https://netimagelr7.fisglobal.com/webemsII/netserver.dll?getinfo&e=830038&type=acct&id=XXXXXXXXXX&output=html

Check:

https://netimagelr7.fisglobal.com/imgreq/imgreqis.dll?fn=ce&id=830038&acct=XXXXXXXX&check=XXXX&amt=XX.XX&side=f&date=YYYYMMDD

comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com],

Can you confirm whether WEST is going to pull statement from our database or use outside API vendor for showing statements? And also can you confirm which API vendor they are going to use for check images?

comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com], [~diegof],

Do you have any account details(acct, check ID, amount, date etc.) that you can you provide for which check images are present at check image vendor side so that I can test my implementation?

Thanks!

Can you please update informations (*App Name, Display Name, Prefix, Archival Period, STMT_TYPE, etc*) in the specification sheet for the DDA statement?
[https://confluence.infoimageinc.com/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=IN&title=WestAmerica+Bank]

And also I need the *prefix* for the Savings statement. I'm setting statement type of Savings statement as *savings*, correct me if I'm wrong.

 * Do you have any account details(checkAcctNum, checkNum, checkAmount, checkDate etc.) that you can you provide for which check images are present at check image vendor side so that I can test my implementation? That means need a sample *index file* for process check_image.
 * Can you confirm that what will be the check image vendor name 'fis' or 'fisGlobal'?
 * Do you have any sample *auth file* that you can provideto test the auth process implementation?

*15, September is the pilot date.*

Thanks!

comment: [~diegof][~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com][~enricob] I consolidated all the pending questions about the checks from Sarwar. Please advise.

Do you have any account details(checkAcctNum, checkNum, checkAmount, checkDate etc.) that you can you provide for which check images are present at check image vendor side so that I can test my implementation? That means need a sample index file for process check_image.
Can you confirm that what will be the check image vendor name 'fis' or 'fisGlobal'?
Can you please provide a sampleindex filefor the check_image process to test check image vendor integration?

I have posted the *ms1_20220831_1_20221019_0710_west.txt*index file on pilot.

And I used '*default*' as stmt_type, please correct me if I'm wrong.



You can use the following credential for the DDA statement:

*CIF: 0001859160*
*acctNum: 131863813*
Or for testing, you can use account numbers from the *ms1_20220831_1_20221019_0710_west**.txt* indexfile.

Thanks!
