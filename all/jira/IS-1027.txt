I ran 0331 cycle today.

Updated sample is at/z/download/pfcu/pfcums11314.2o1.pdf. Due to file size I couldn't upload it in jira. If you are facing to reach the file please request help from [~TunA].

This sample has the scenario in the 1st customer of the statement that client is requesting (Year to Date Dividend line has a value other than zero).

Thanks
