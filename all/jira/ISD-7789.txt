I put Shun's assessment at bottom. We are currently pending client approval on final pdf and I will attach that with IS's new timeline after approval. Thanks!

comment: [~Bryanl] Any update on getting the new loan backer pdf?

comment: Hi [~Shun.Kuwashima]

Leo provided new timeline today, I have edited Jira and provided new loan backer pdf (client has advised it will stay navy blue like current production). Thanks!

comment: Thanks [~rodriguez], index files posted successfully on pilot.

[~Bryanl] I also uploaded the new loan backer to the member site, attaching loan disclosure screenshots. I had to deploy the backer locally, however the main point is just to show that the backer has been updated on our lower environments by referring to the url at the top of each screenshot (I couldn't get a scrolling capture to include the whole page legibly with the url at the top, hence why there are two screenshots).

author: shun.kuwashima
comment: Thanks [~rodriguez], I took down the previous files and posted the new ones onto pilot.

[~Bryanl], I made the update and provided updated screenshots to this story, please have the client review for approval.


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~Bryanl] Live date is showing 9/30 but I believe we are still waiting for client pilot approval right? Can you push out the date?


author: bryanl
comment: Hi [~Shun.Kuwashima]

I will ask for new live date from Leo when client approves both samples, thanks! I can make due date October 7th temporarily for now.

[~Bryanl] I updated the loan disclosure again on the member site and attached updated screenshots. I also reposted the new statement index files onto pilot, so the client can review on the pilot admin site.


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~Bryanl] I saw parallel 34416 was created, but I didn't see any update on whether pilot was approved and if I could proceed to QA. I was out for the last couple days so I didn't check in on this till now. I'm moving my updates to stage now and will ask QA to review my update first.

[~Igor.Khosid] PROV has a peculiar setup internally on our end, therefore I would need to demo the update for you. I'll message you about this tomorrow.

[~Bryanl] I'll update the status for this ticket to Pending Parallel, just waiting on parallel to finish before releasing update to production. 


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~Bryanl] My update requires code release/server restart, so ideally I'd like to release this to prod on wed, 10/19. If parallel finishes before that, would it be ok to release on 10/19?
