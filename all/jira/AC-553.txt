description: *Description of Work:*

Current slcudna_process.sh program seems to be using the old /home/master/ucsf_client.pl program. Update this program /home/master/slcudna_process.sh be retrofitted to use the current processing script and use the current red titan server (ca-rtitan-pr-04) server instead? Hopefully this will address the memory issue that occurs frequently via TS #25112
