Would you see if we can accommodate the request from PROV below?

Hi Joye,  If "www." can be added to the URL at the start of the third line of text, please add it.  If there isn't enough room, then it's fine as is.

Thank you,

Bob

In the estmt text "loan" is displayed twice in the footer. Is this expected?

Are you able to remove the second "loan" in the footer?


author: JIRAUSER11401
comment: [~jharvey]I can try to remove it, but I didn't make any change or update on that.


author: jharvey
comment: [~Tevis Mak] [~gthillaivel]

I say let's leave it as is, if Tevis made no changes to the footer.  I do not see it twice on any of the previous cycle in InfoTrac.  

Please go ahead with completing QA and releasing the code.

comment: One is on the preprint and the other is lasered. Since the preprint is on the estmt you see it twice on estmt.

comment: [~Tevis Mak]  [~jharvey]--Please check above screenshot .Tap test failed


author: yameelee
comment: [~gthillaivel]/[~Andrey.Kutsenko]-the env1= "5723". It has client logo and return address on there already. Please request for the correct envelope for tap test if needed. But as far as the logo goes, its on the envelope so we dont need to tap the return address part.
