Hi Daphne, I can get samples provided to QA and print sample information ready by end of day.

This update to the greyscale percentage (increase to 50) is ready for sample review. Note that there is no letter 016, and for letter 17, a border was added to the header box in addition to the shade increase.
 # Exported updated project files to \\download-nas02\qa\GCBK\GCBKDL<###>.zip
 # Attached DPVS [^gcbkdla113_dpvs.pdf][^gcbkdl313_dpvs.pdf]and samples[^gcbkdla113_sample.pdf][^gcbkdla313_sample.pdf]
 # Letter 015 is processed as segment 3, while the rest are processed as segment 1, so that is why additional DPVS and samples are attached.

comment: Hi [~SamV2021],please see following from OPS:

please see DL 007 below. I believe the customer was going for the 50% shading on all sectional headers? Shouldn't the top header match the grayscale shading of the bottom one? If so, programmer should enter same grayscale values for both areas. All daily Ltrs recently submitted for test have the same issue as below. Please advise

Please adjust 1st section header to match the second section header (lighter shade).

Thanks

Hi Daphne, per your e-mail regarding the visibility of the 1st section header, I will make the update to the shading of the 2nd section header once we received confirmation on the desired shading level.

Thanks,
Sam

[~SamV2021] , per attached email, we will not be proceeding with the shading updates. The original setting will be kept.

Please cancel Jira.

Thanks!
