title: UFCU - Update to Archival for Mo Stmts
description: *Parallel Requirement: No*





From Diego:
 The use of the xfer file is new only to monthly statements. For other applications you will simply need to pull the last fields(along with the other items we already pull from xfer) which are new in the xfer file Field 21 == email address and 22 = SalesforceID

This changes the index we output from:

DocCode,MemberNum,MemberName,StatementDate, path/filename,statement name,delivery preference,YES

TO:

DocCode,MemberNum,MemberName,StatementDate, path/filename,statement name,delivery preference,YES,email,SalesforceID

For monthly statement we will need to read in the file and match up the account number to field1 of the xfer and pull those 2 fields above.

Just confirming now the actual order of the 2 new fields on index but i believe the order on their end can be set to what we provide. just wanted to add some information now.

comment: [~diegof]: Can you review the results of this testing? Sorry! I never got around to reviewing the results while you were OOO the first week of November. Since this is an EOM job, i'm going to update the live date to 11/30/2021.



[~andreav]: Please advise if you agree with the live date of 11/30/2021. If so, please update your Epic as well.


author: andreav
comment: I agree with the live date. However, we had lots of internal correspondence today and confusion about if Sakib needs to roll out the update he did on the zip method or not. I need answers to below ASAP.

My questions:
# Do we still need to update the zip method or leave as it currently is in production?
# Did the last archival sample with the 2 new fields use the old or new zip method? 
# Depending on the answers above, we may need to send the client a corrected archival sample to approve.

comment: Hi [~William.Kong],

I hope the questions that Andrea asked in her last mail is to you.

Please make some comments on those.

Thanks

comment: Hi Andrea,

The last archival sample with the 2 new fields use the new zip method.

As William stated in TS 23924 that client has not unzipped the old archival samples properly, so i think we are good with old archival zipping method.

Need a reply from William.

[~William.Kong], please correct me if i am wrong.

Thanks


author: william.kong
comment: [~mahbubS]: Please keep original zipping method prior to going live on 11/4 2021. We can discuss a little during/after our scrum meeting today.


author: andreav
comment: We also need to provide the client with a new archival sample using the old zip method ASAP. They are currently testing the last archival sample using the wrong zip method.

comment: Hi [~andreav] [~diegof],

Ran the process with all the updates (IS-549 and IS-592 updates) using cycle 1031 data file.

Archival zipping method is now similar to production (7za).

I copied sample to /z/infoftps4/ufcu/client_pickup/ufcums12314.2o5.pdf

Archival sample is at: /z/infoftps4/ufcu/client_pickup/

!image-2021-11-26-12-14-18-169.png!

I forgot to run using segment 1. That's why the archival sample have the segment 2 in the snap.

The archival run takes too much time. So i didn't run it again using segment 1.

The latest xref file isufcu_xfer_11242021.txt.pgp from client. And this xref don't has the salesForceID in it. Only has the email id at the end of each line. So the archival index file has empty value in place of salesForceID.

Let me know if there is any other issue.

Thanks

Did client approve the archival sample?

Thanks

comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid],

Please Start QA on this.

Parallel id:20211122042807

Updated project is in QA folder:/d/iss/qa/UFCU/UFCUMS11.zip

This is an archival related task, so no DPVS and print range needed.

Need to check the archival index for new extra 2 fields (instructions in the description of this jira).

You may need the CIF file (required for archival). The pgp and decrypted txt cif both files are in/z/download/pfcu/xref/ dir.

And the latest xref file for this task can be found at/home/test/keep/ufcu/

Note: We used a preprocessing scriptufcums1_xref_handling.py, which appends info in data file when account number matches in cif file (preprocessing script is used in processing script). The appended data can be found in/z/ufcu/ms1/data_files/ufcums1_103121_merged_final.dat.xrefed

Let me know if anything more you need.

Thanks

comment: Sakib, once QA passes, DO NOT release the code until I have confirmed a release date with the client. 


author: mahbubs
comment: Hi [~andreav],

I can see the Status of this Jira "QA Completed".

Should we proceed for release?

Thanks


author: andreav
comment: No, we should release together with IS-592 right? I think Will had stated to aim for a 12/8 release? Once parallel for IS-592 passes, I will inform the client so we can coordinate the code release and so he can start sending the new xref files.


author: andreav
comment: I am checking if a code release date of 12/7 will work for the client. In the meantime, please provide the information needed for IS managers to roll out the code when needed.
