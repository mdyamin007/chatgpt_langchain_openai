title: HCCU - Invoice - LoanPDFi Conversion to AFP2PDF Python [InHse]
description: Update existing processing script to no longer use PDFi tool to create pdf.
 Instead use afp2pdf.py program with index_build_multicore option for ALL statement related apps.
 The smaller daily notice jobs can use the current index_build options.

All the zip file, pgp encryption, index file contents, and PDF file naming convention must remain exactly the same original specifications.

Please ensure the standard SOP on the directory structure must be followed: 
 ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/pdf, ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/zip, ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/work is followed.
 Also, clear the folder directory folder before each processing. We do NOT want to accumulate previous runs.

The current program should support checking total PDF counts verification to make sure the expected pdf matches the total number for pdfs generated; If not, incorporate this standard verification logic

DT_JOB_ID:
 133581-C30.01-V20988

Processing Scripts to modify:
 hcculs1_process.sh

Data Files to use:
 HCCU_RSTATLOC_050522.pgp



*NOTE*: This job runs on RH2. Since we are migrating from RHS to RH2, we should test all options so that we can do afpcompare and also ensure there is no errors in the processing logs.

comment: Hi [~William.Kong]

We have already discussed about this. still giving a status here



Parallel id20210528142128 already created by [~jun]

I guess he is working on it pdfi to archival conversion.

let me know if he finished it or we need to complete it .

comment: [~tanmay]: I've confirmed with [~OIR](Terrence) that [~jun]can take over since he completed this last year, but just needing testing.



[~jun]: Thank you for confirming the status this morning. Can you please take this project back and test this on*RHS* server with ALL job_sel options. We also plan to migrate this application to run on RHS server moving foward.

I've completed runningHCCU_RSTATBIL_ARCHIVAL_071522.pgp andHCCU_RSTATBIL_071522.pgp for all job options.

Output is here:/z/pdf_afp/hccu/hcculs1/

The PDF name uses the system time so the naming convention and index file is a little different from parallel vs production. The content of the PDF looks same.



For example:

Prod index:

632932-01_071522_*1234*_00855.pdf|

Prod Filename:

632932-01_071522_*1234*_00855.pdf



Test Index:

632932-01_071522_*1456*_00855.pdf|

Test filename:

632932-01_071522_*1456*_00855.pdf

comment: [~jun]: Thanks for the heads up! I will take a took.. Be prepared to submit this to QA if my initial pdf_compare assessment is good and likewise afp_compare. I will rely on you to help check error in logs and DPVS to make sure all is good. Thanks!
