title: ca-cddir-pr-##:   Windows Folder Share Permission
description: [~kent.chan], [~premraj.patil], [~hesham.hanna]:



I was able to RDP into the brisbane cd director as Neil, however, he does not have admin privilege.



Since that is the case, can you create read/write share permission under the c:\cdDirector



The share name needs to be "cdDirector" for both cdDirector machine.



The username I'm using to mount from ca-preproc-pr-02 is 'rh1login'.

[~davidt]: I sparked you earlier. Please advise if I should just go ahead and have DP test or do you need to check the system first.
