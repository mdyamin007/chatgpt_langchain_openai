comment: HI [~kericapote],

Please open a PR ticket for this request and assign to me first. So I can review and provide assessment, hours and timeline.

[~Natalie.Tom]has some other projects before this. So we cannot go live on next Tuesday.

Thanks

Since you already created JIRA IS-1404, I added following assessment in both TS 31327 and JIRA IS-1404.

Thanks,

Is the client emailPrintsupport@affinityplus.org?


author: kericapote
comment: [~Natalie.Tom] I don't have  visibility into that.  It should be whatever email the other dpvs are sent to.

comment: [~Natalie.Tom] do we need to  parallel?  The file came last night.  Can you release code and run it in production?


author: JIRAUSER11103
comment: [~kericapote]we don't need parallel. DP may already processed this application according to process log, but we can release it earlier than the live date, 8/22.

Code has been released. Backup ID:20220822135448

comment: [~Natalie.Tom] APCU received the dpvs but they are asking us to change the name in the subject lineto: Mort Stmt Denial letter DPVS for cycle 24 is ready.  I don't think we can put a variable in the subject line (cycle 24), can we?

They also do not want a copy in the client pick up folder.  Please remove that.

Thanks!

Since a standard script is being used for this application, the subject line can't be changed. As for the removal of the dpvs in the client pickup folder in order to make that change, please create adifferent Jira ticket.
