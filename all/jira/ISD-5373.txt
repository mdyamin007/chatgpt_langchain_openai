title: OFCU - [21150][pvt] Daily eStatements enrollments Setup
description: OFCU - Daily eStatements enrollments Setup
* Description:Update the customer's enrollment status on a daily basis instead of having it updated monthly through the statement file.

*Specs: Unique User ID | Account Number | Account Name | Status | Email | Modified Date*
* Unique User ID: This will just be the Member Number.
* Account Number: This is the Member Number.
* Account Name: The Member Name.
* Status: The delivery preference:P(aper) orE(lectronic)
* Email: Email address required to enroll into Electronic preference. Can be left empty if the status isP.
* Modified Date: The enrollment time in Unix Epoch Time.

*Example:*
* 12345|12345|John Doe|E|john.doe@email.com|1625846715
* 44444|44444|Jane Doe|P||1625846715

The Modified Date is used to determine whether the process should update the Delivery Preference. For example, if the Modified Date represent July 9 at 7:00 a.m. and the file is processed on July 9 at 8 a.m. the process will check to see if there were any user choices after 7:00 a.m. Maybe the user has logged on and already changed the delivery preference at 7:45 a.m. Because of this, the delivery preference from the file will be skipped, since we do not want to override the user-choice at 7:45 a.m.

Alternatively, we can opt to not have Modified Date, and use the Processing Time as the benchmark, i.e. if the file is processed at 8 a.m. then we would only skip if we discover any user's choice that occurs after 8 a.m.

Setup will be 5 hours.

*Timeline*
*Turnover: 9/16
*Pilot: 9/29
*Live: 11/12

I noticed that the status and email header is swapped. The specs has it as*Status | Email.*

But in the file, the format is in*Email* *|**Status.*

Per OFCU, they had the order swapped on accident. The corrected test file (Sample-data-file2.txt) is attached [^Sample-data-file2.txt.txt] .

Thanks, Barnett

I have processed the file. Have the client validate for approval. Make sure for Production, the file is properly named. ex: ofcu_enrollment_20210921_1315.txt orofcu_enrollment_20210921_1315.txt.gpg if encrypted.

Please see OFCU response below:

I reviewed the accounts from the sample. All the accounts listed were showing active - but for those that had the "E" status - they were not showed as enrolled, and the delivery preference was still set to paper. 

Here are example accounts that should be enrolled in eStatements:
0000117534
0000117536
0000117538

Thanks, Barnett

Hello Barnett, I have truncated the zeros.

OFCU confirms that the account number is working correctly with the suppressed zeros. Can you please advise on OFCU comment? 

Per OFCU, 
* The next piece that we done - is we need the API call from Alkami's Online banking - to InfoImage - to indicate that the member has subscribed. 
* For example - for account 117543 - in online banking in beta - the eStmt status is showing not enrolled in eStmt. In InfoTrac Pilot - this account is enrolled in eStatements. We need to the API setting to reflect that the member has enrolled. 

Thanks, Barnett

QA Instructions:
 # The file we will be testing is/d/INPUT-DEV/I3/process-files/ofcu/ofcu_enrollment_10282021.txt
 # Check the account numbers without the leading zeros, they should not exist. Running the file will create those accounts without the leading zeros.
 # Run the file (ask me to run it if issues arises )
 # Check the accounts without leading zeros if the delivery preference matches
