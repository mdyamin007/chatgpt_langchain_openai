Note: Create for internal use only.

Both reports set up, only missing frequency right now.

Old frequency: Daily 10am

comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com],
I think previously we used to run an enotice bounceback report for internal use only. Do we need to create one for the client as well or just for internal?

comment: Lai mentioned in TS 21553 that the bb for DL was discontinued at core conversion. So this will be for internal only.

comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com], the enotice bounceback report schedules are setup for the most part, the only thing left is to set the frequency. This internal report used to generate daily at 10am PST. Is this frequency ok to use? Also once I set the frequency, we should expect the reports to generate automatically the next day onward (assuming we're sticking with daily reports).

comment: Yes, 10am PST is fine.

comment: Thanks [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com], they're setup to run at 10am daily. I'll monitor the process tomorrow.


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com], the internal reports ran successfully at 10am. Closing out this jira ticket.

comment: Disabled the frequency for now, will re-enable once IS makes their updates too.

comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] can I re-enable the internal enotice bouncebacks? 


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima]- yes.

comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com], Thanks I've re-enabled both enotice bouncebacks to trigger daily at 10am. Closing ticket.
