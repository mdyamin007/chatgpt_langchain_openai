title: Brisbane:  Synology_IS exportfs/port open request and williamK password reset
description: #1: Can you open nfs & roc port (i.e 2049 and 111) so that 10.8.9.37 (ftpbu_linux can access it)?

I just tested from the menlo ftpbu_linux server (10.8.9.36) and confirmed that I cannot access it:

#2: On the synology_is server, can you confirm that /etc/exports has the 10.8.9.36 IP address.

If not, please add 10.8.9.36 permission and run exportfs -av command after you are done.



#3: Is it possible to reset my williamK password. I think my account is on the synology_is server, but I was never able to ssh in the past when this box was on Menlo DataCenter. If I can have this account, it will allow me to self-server to troubleshoot item #2 if needed.

comment: [~premraj.patil] and [~kent.chan]: I'm try to update my script so that I can sync the Menlo Data Center data files inrementally now that the synology_is server is in Brisbane. However, I'm not able to mount from 10.8.9.36 (FTPBU Linux) to Brisbane (synology_is) 10.4.20.7 drive.



This is temporary until we get Isilon server setup.
