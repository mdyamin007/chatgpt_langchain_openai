Could you please check with the client when and how they will be sending in the final data files. Ideally, we would have the finalized data files by the middle of next week.


author: mattl
comment: [~SamV2021]they can be sent any time next week. They'll attach to the team support ticket if that's okay with you?

Okay, that works!

One additional thing: So of all the sample letters that the client provided, only one of them "Newport Closing Letter Aug2021 final .docx" has the logo added to the top of the page. Does the client want the logo added to all letters (which will be the second page)? A logo and return address will already be on the cover page, but do they also want the logo on the second page? If so, please provide an updated version for all letters; otherwise, place replace the Newport one with one that does not have the logo.


author: mattl
comment: The client advised they would like the Logo all letters. Would you like me to forward the email with all the new mapping? or attach all of them here? [~SamV2021]

comment: [~MattL]

The forwarded e-mail is fine. Thanks!

comment: Hi [~SamV2021],

[ Charleston West Closing Letter Aug2021 final .docx|https://app.na3.teamsupport.com/dc/1/attachments/10983671]

Client had the following feed back.



1. In the letter for our Vincennes banking center, is it possible to squeeze in a blank line between "To Our Valued Clients" and the first paragraph? If not, this is no big deal.

2. In the three text boxes on the right hand side of each letter, can you move the text up to remove the white space between the boxes? I updated the Charleston West letter as an example, but would like this change on all 9 letters.
