comment: Hi, 
Sample is attached. Please check.
[Note: we have removed comma after city to adjust the scenario who has nothing but city information [This scenario is attached in group discussion]. Please also confirm us that we do not need to add country information after zipcode. Now, country is not added in the sample.]

Thank you,
Sumi

comment: Hi,
The updated sample is attached.
sfce compromised card letter updated 
- used colored logo for e-statement, archival, b/w logo for print
- colored footer for e-statement, archival b/w footer for print
- used returned address same as previous daily letter
- added country to last address line

The colon is missing from footer (as mapping) in sample as the previous one has no colon in footer. In the return address, the comma is missing after avenue as the previous one has no comma. 

data file: /z/download/sfce/compromised_card_letter/20210420_150528_000.Card_Alerts_Mailing_Report.txt 
Let us know if there is any issue.

Thank you 
Sumi

The sow has the info code 001 in the letter matrix but there is already a letter with that info code in production. so, I am using info code 301. Please update the SOW.

sample attached after updating date format and increased space between date and cardholder name.

Note: The address font is always arial 8. It cannot be changed.


author: ratnam
comment: Hi Tohid, please review attached PDF and template. CU mentioned there is verbiage change. I compared the samples to the new template they provided but couldn't find any difference except that date is above address that CU agreed to place above card holder name. Please let me know if you see any difference and change verbiage accordingly.

The second point of "When your new card arrives: " is slightly changed. Previously it was "...attached to your card" not it is "...attached to your new card"

comment: Hi [~ratnam]

The date might be visible through the envelop window. Should we still print the date above customer address?


author: ratnam
comment: Hi Tohid, please do not change the date. But proceed with other verbiage change.



Thanks

comment: [~tohidulI]: The updated Enrollment File specification is documented in confluence. Please see description area for the information.


author: william.kong
comment: [~tohidulI]: Please HOLD of on the Enrollment File exercise. [~ratnam]informed me that SFCE changed their mind. [~kericapote]did not notate this in Jira so I may have wasted your time yesterday on this requirement. In the meantime, I will put a STRIKETHROUGH in the description of work for the Enrollment file portion.



[~kericapote]: Once the requirements are updated, please update SOW and notate to [~tohidulI]the new requirements. (e.g. Still keep eStatement or not? Print all or not, etc etc etc...). Are we 100% sure client no longer want email attachment or not. Also, we need alert ISD ([~mamunur.rashid])on this as well via Jira


author: kericapote
comment: [~William.Kong] I emailed everyone working on this project and their supervisors once SFCE said this on our call Friday. The client said they don't want the attachment but they have changed their specs several times during this project. so I don't know what they will decide on. Phoebe has sent it back to the AM for them to ascertain final specs for us to reevaluate. I will update everything once I have a final decision.

comment: Hi [~ratnam]

According to SOW the invalid address report needs to encrypted as it has "pgp" extension. Can you provide a pgp key for this?

I looked at the previous projects(monthly, daily, visa), but they do not have encryption for the invalid address report.


author: ratnam
comment: Hi Tohid, SOW has been updated to remove pgp encryption to match existing application.

Thanks

comment: [~kericapote]: What is the revised live date client wants to target to go live for setting up this notice? My understanding is that client wants to resume this project. Please advise so that we can update the Target Live date in both Jira and the IMP 2022 report.



[~phoebe.george]/[~ratnam]/[~mamunur.rashid] : FYI so that we can set correct live date expectations.

comment: [~William.Kong] Per our last resource meeting, DSI provided a new start date of 3/9 for this project, and we were pending confirmation on the IS managers if we can use this new date for an updated timeline for us to share internally before informing customer. thanks!


author: william.kong
comment: [~phoebe.george]/[~kericapote] : My apologies. I forgot that verbal conversation. I did follow-up with [~rony]/[~tohidulI]to confirm if they did promise a 3/9 live date and they said yes. Live date is two days from now which doesn't give enough time for approvals, QA, parallel. Here's what I'm proposing:

According to this Jira ticket, last samples was provided back in 2/15/2022. We have not received formal approval. Here's what I'm proposing for now:



3/9/2022: Final Approvals (This Wednesday)

3/10/2022: QA (Please get [~Igor.Khosid]to commit to this. I'm assuming he may need 2-3 days)

3/15/2022 to 3/21/2022: Parallel Initiated with IS & ISD together

3/22/2022: Go Live Date.



Please confirm with [~Igor.Khosid] (QA)/ [~mamunur.rashid](ISD DSi) can agree to this.



Thanks!



-- Will






author: phoebe.george
comment: [~William.Kong] 3/9 was not the approval date, it was the start date of re-initiating the project as a whole. I need to factor in ISD dates also.

If you can confirm that the programmer/DSI team can re-start on 3/9, we will update the full timeline on our end to come up with a new live date. ISD has to still setup on their end as well, but was pending the new IS coding start (continuation date) first.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~William.Kong] [~Peter.Dang] Please confirm if IS can resume this project based on the date that DSI provided. 

[~kericapote] Please follow-up to confirm to move forward with DSI once IS managers confirm.


author: kericapote
comment: [~tohidulI] [~rony] please confirm new time line based on your sample date of 3/11 and pilot date of 3/17.

Thanks!

comment: QA - blocked. Unable to start the testing.
Please provide:
1. [~tohidulI] - PR ID and index file if needed
2. [~ratnam] - please confirm if the "Compromise_Card20Letter_20012521_updated.pdf" is the latest mapping?
3. [~kericapote] - please be sure that SOW - updated. 
My understanding this is print and archival - based on the SOW? So why I received ISD-5904? Please - confirm. 
Are you planning to have "Turn over to QA and Parallel meeting? 
Please - attach approved samples and request the print samples

[~Andrey.Kutsenko] [~phoebe.george] - FYI


author: kericapote
comment: [~Igor.Khosid]this is print and e BUT SFCE's Online Banking ([~tohidulI] ) is not ready yet so we are setting up e now on our side and will test OLB connectivity when they are ready in June. I am requesting print samples now and will make sure SOW and samples are updated.

comment: 1.
 [~kericapote] please clarify
 1.1. In SOW the file naming convention for the report is specified in different ways, how should it be?
 !image-2022-03-28-14-08-27-570.png!

p.s. the script generates like this:
 !image-2022-03-28-14-49-06-984.png!


 1.2. Do I need a colon after the words TEL and FAX (see approved customer samples "SFCE Compromised Card APPROVED SAMPLE.pdf")?

!image-2022-03-28-14-13-18-150.png!

2.
 [~ratnam]please
 2.1. Update the mapping according to the approved samples client (see differences here "image-2022-03-28-15-02-13-228.png")
 2.2. Post the corrected version on a shared resource
