comment: [~yameelee] [~Shun.Kuwashima] We are not able to go live with this at this time (based on existing setup) because there are applications that DON'T require AOLP that are flagged under the same electronic tab. Because of this, we cannot enable E-AOLP for one application over the other since one application does not require any approvals. We will close/cancel this ticket for now, and I will re-open a new one once we have a solution to possibly move the non-approval required applications to it's own eStatement tab.
