[~zhuoxinT], please confirm what next steps are. Do we need to initiate parallel and have DP test?


author: JIRAUSER11101
comment: [~dyuen]

Per description above. We should have DP to test both cases, run withIDCU_DL_mmddyy.7z.gpg,

and IDCU_DL_mmddyy_anyNumber.7z.gpg.

*anyNumber cannot be 1.

comment: [~zhuoxinT]-Can you confirm whether parallel id is same?
Please attach new DPVS


author: JIRAUSER11101
comment: [~gthillaivel] 
yes, the parallel id is same.

For this update:

It will create 2 DPVS located in different folders.

for example :

segment 1 will be in /z/daily/idcudla/0420_1/
segment 2 will be in /z/daily/idcudla/0420_2/
Depends on the data file cycle and segment.

new DPVS for seg#1:[^idcudla120.print]

new DPVS for seg#2:[^idcudla220.print]
