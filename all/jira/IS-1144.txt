Assessment Details (IS):

================
 - Parallel required: (Yes)

 - Setup PDF retrieval for Visa(gocuvs1) and MC(GOCUMC1) statements.


 - File Naming Conventions.

 * Zip file name: GOCU_MAC_Archival_<MMDDYYYY>_<Seg#>.zip
 * Zip file name: GOCU_SAV_Archival_<MMDDYYYY>_<Seg#>.zip

Please confirm application name you would like used (highlightedabove)



 Individual PDF file naming convention: < MMDDYYYY>__<Acct#>__<Seq#>.pdf
 (MMDDYYYY is current system date)

 Index file name: <appID_InfoImage Internal>_ProcessingDate - YYYYMMDD>_GOCU.txt

 Index file format (comma): DATE|account_num|member name|pdf_Filename. - Please use current date.

For the account number please use Line 24 in data file - ######-60 for both files.

Zipped files to be split in batches of 2,000 statements due to file size.

*NOTE*: This job use to run on RH2 but testing was performed on RHS2. It looks like we will need to run on RHS2 moving forward since we will be discontinue RH2 server usage.

Will it be dvd archival like current set up or just zip archival?

comment: Hi [~rony],

Here is client's response to your question.

1. Will we use before hyphen part for pdf file name and in index file or full?
 * I need clarity on this question. Are you referring to the file name or the hyphen in the data? If you could provide us example file names, with and without hyphen, that would be really helpful. Usually, a date time stamp is sufficient.

2. Would it be ok to use<Seg#> in index file name like for zip file naming.
 * I don't see why not if it does not replace the date on the file name.




author: rony
comment: Hi [~dawnl]

Please ignore question 1.

For 2 we will use the index file naming like this:

<appID_InfoImage Internal>_ProcessingDate - YYYYMMDD>_GOCU_<seg#>.txt

Updated GOCUMC1 (mastercard) archival sample:

Updated GOCUVS1 (visa) archival sample:
    */z/pdf_afp/gocu/gocuvs1/zip/GOCU_SAV_Archival_04212021_1.zip*



for "1. Index file name: shows an additional segment" this issue:
since the index file in the zip file is the sub segment of the main index file, a seg no. is appended in the name of the inedex file.

It is based on the previous works. If client disagree with this then we 'll update the index file name as well.

the rest of the 2 issues have been fixed.

comment: Hi [~sadiqs],

Here is the questions from client along with Tun's answers.

*1.As we move away from disk, would Info Image be able to provide just the PDF statements  no index files?*

Yes. We can remove index file.

*2. We are hoping to utilize an existing process to ingest VISA statements into our ECM. However, if that option presents a challenge, we may need to have the index files reformatted. Would that be possible on your end?*

We can send individual PDF files only, without index file. But if we need to reformat index, please provide required index format to review.

*3.For Student Visa Statements, are the test files encrypted and are the PDF files flattened PDF files?*

The test archival files are zip up by application types (VISA or Mastercard). Please reference to Ticket #27987. I dont see return files encryption key for Golden 1 Credit Union. If we need to encrypt the zip file, we will need to setup encryption key. Dawn and Jessica: Please work with Peter or Terrence for that.

*4.Also, when copying and pasting data from the statement, we get wingdings instead of words or letters. For instance, this is what we get when we copy and paste STATEMENT OF ACCOUNT:*

*  *

We need to research this items for archival process. Dawn and Jessica: Please request Sadiq to research via IS-1144.

comment: [~sadiqs]: How come I don't see the afp file in/z/pdf_afp/gocu/gocumc1/afp directory? 

I may need to contact our software provider to evaluate.



Can you please re-run your program in parallel to make sure the original afp does stay in/z/pdf_afp/gocu/gocumc1/afp/ folder so that we can research this issue and future issues.



Also, please help copy the font files used in my folder for my convenience to share the fonts with our software provider to research this reported issue as well.



Thanks!

Please provide new samples. See client's feedback below:

"These are the ones we are having issues with. We would need new samples. The PDF files you sent appeared to be like the file had an overlay on it or it was a fillable PDF versus a flattened."

Thanks.

About the font issue, I've checked the pdf files. It doesn't make any problems while copying and pasting. Still, please recheck samples if requires.

If you find any font issue then I'llcopy the font files used to will's folderto research this issue.

and also the afp files are available in*/z/pdf_afp/gocu/gocumc1/afp//z/pdf_afp/gocu/gocuvs1/afp/* directories if required for research.

What is your availability?

I am attaching one pdf from the pdf archival sample for the client to test.[^06112022_1227533-60_1.pdf]

I can copy the text from pdf and paste into the notepad successfully. I don't see any gibberish character, that client mentioned in comment https://jira.infoimageinc.com/browse/IS-1144?focusedCommentId=44358&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-44358.

!image-2022-08-17-05-01-41-536.png!





And I am not sure what the client meant by *"These are the ones we are having issues with. We would need new samples. The PDF files you sent appeared to be like the file had an overlay on it or it was a fillable PDF versus a flattened."* in comment https://jira.infoimageinc.com/browse/IS-1144?focusedCommentId=45277&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-45277.



So If client check the pdf I attached and provide some snapshot to clearly specify the problem they are facing.



And if meeting needed please go ahead and arrange one , if possible between 9am-10am.

Thanks

comment: [~dawnl]: Please advise if we can get resolution to this PDF Archival project. We have to go live by 8/31 as the server gocu is running on using the current old PDF conversion tool that is used to create CDs will be shutting down on a targeted date of 8/31/2022.





[~OIR](Terrence): FYI. This client facing project is another factor that can cause delay on our PDFi to AFP2PDF project. Currently today, gocu is using PDFi to generate CDs.

Here is the feedback from client:

"That worked and I was able to view and use a sample that we copy from the disc that you send us. I was able to successfully ingest the statement with no issues using my configuration. 

With that said, the issue still appears to be a format issue. Can you review the files you send to us on the disk see what format you are using and try to duplicate that with the files you are sending us now?"

gocuvs1_08212022_1.zipis the file client mentioned from the disc. The format in file is correct.

Please review this file and try to duplicate that with the file you provided.

DP hassaved gocuvs1_08212022_1.zip to my ac-secure-share folder.

author: rony
comment: Hi [~dawnl]

I am quite not sure what formatting issue the client is mentioning here. But the difference I see in current output naming vs previous are:



naming - old vs new

pdf naming - VS.<MMDDYYYY>.<Acct#>-67.PDF ->     <MMDDYYYY>_<Acct#>_<Seq#>.pdf
zip naming - gocuvs1_<MMDDYYYY>_<seq>.zip ->      GOCU_SAV_Archival_<MMDDYYYY>_<seq>.zip



And we removed the password used for zipping. And we are splitting by 2000 pdf counts, meaning 2000pdf in one zip.



If the client can tell us exactly what formatting issue the client is seeing would be helpful.



Thanks

Rony, client responded:

Hi Bill,

We are attempting to capture values from the filed in the center of the statement that contains the account #. In the sample you sent me I am unable to capture the data. In the files you send us via a disk we can capture that data. Just by looking at the two files it appears the font may be bold or even a different font. Below is another screenshot of where we are looking to capture data from.

author: rony
comment: Hi [~Peter.Dang]

I am not sure what is the problem here. First of all we didn't change anything about formatting, we just changed archival from pdfi to afp2pdf and index index/zip file naming, dvd archival to normal pdf archival.



Any for the portion client highlighted is actually ocr line and OCBB0 (OCR-A) font is being used and when I can open it in Foxit phantom it can detect the font.

If client still sees some font issue then please ask client to send with snapshot to show exactly which portion of text they are unable to read, this will save some back and forth.
