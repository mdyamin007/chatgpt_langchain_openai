comment: Hi [~nprimak],

The following step should be followed for testing console log error removal:
 # Log into the estatement site for the client.
 # Open console in browser (*Shift + CTRL + J* for chrome).
 # Clear the cache of the browser.
 # Visit every possible route and perform every operation of the site and check if there is any error in the console.

And the following step should be followed for testing heartbeat code:
 # Visit the fowllowing url: [https://bkfnstage.infoimageinc.com:9780/heartbeat.jsp]
 # Check if returns a JSON like
{code:java}
[{"status": 200},{"message":"Alive"}]{code}

 # If the client has MSM then visit the following urls: [https://bkfnstage.infoimageinc.com:9780/msm/heartbeat.jsp]
 # Check if it returns the same JSON: 
{code:java}
[{"status": 200},{"message":"Alive"}]{code}



Thanks,

Mamun

comment: Thank you Mamun! I was confused about heartbeat changes, did not do it before, thank you for explanations.

Verified on SSO staging, changes work as expected.
