Per Peter, parallel is not needed for this update.

Igor, do we need another round of QA or can we proceed with code release? Regardless, I believe we can release the code by end of the day today (07/22/2021).

Status "QA completed" means - QA is done no further testing is required

comment: Filled out program transfer form. Please sign if needed for bypassing parallel.

There shouldn't be any form needed, in the original quote of hours Peter stated that no parallel was needed. Please let me know once code has been released so I can notify the client.
