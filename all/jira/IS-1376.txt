Per the client:

These look great!

Please mask the first 4 numbers of the account number.

For the notice to account 400722387, Ryan is has a Do Not Mail flag on his account. Please update the salutation to have his name instead of **DO NOT MAIL** after "Dear".

In addition,Can we get a notice archive file so we can test importing the notices to OnBase?

Shouldn't the archival path be what would happen in production? It wouldn't go to my secure share.


author: rony
comment: Hi [~Kbittmann]

Parallel client pick up and production client pick up is not the same. You can ask Dp to put the archival file to client pickup manually if needed. In production, it will go automatically by the script.



Thanks

We followed this from other DFA for wecu daily. Would it be possible to provide this to the client this way and if the client says to remove it we will remove it.
