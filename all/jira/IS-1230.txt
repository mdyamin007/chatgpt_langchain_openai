title: APCU - Stmt - Escrow Analysis PDFi Conversion to AFP2PDF Python [InHse]
description: Update existing processing script to no longer use PDFi tool to create pdf.
 Instead use afp2pdf.py program with index_build_multicore option for ALL statement related apps.
 The smaller daily notice jobs can use the current index_build options.

All the zip file, pgp encryption, index file contents, and PDF file naming convention must remain exactly the same original specifications.

Please ensure the standard SOP on the directory structure must be followed: 
 ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/pdf, ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/zip, ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/work is followed.
 Also, clear the folder directory folder before each processing. We do NOT want to accumulate previous runs.

The current program should support checking total PDF counts verification to make sure the expected pdf matches the total number for pdfs generated; If not, incorporate this standard verification logic

DT_JOB_ID:
 133599-C30.01-V21811

Processing Scripts to modify:
 apcuya1_process.sh

Data Files to use:
 APCU_EA_060722.zip.pgp



*NOTE*: This job runs on RH2 server. Since we are migrating from RH2 server to RHS, please test ALL job_sel options to ensure RHS can run with error messages in the processing log files.

comment: [~jira_naru] : Sorry to do this you, but I added one additional requirement to test and make sure this program can run via RHS server instead of RH2. Please ensure there is no error message.

comment: Hi [~jira_naru],

When you are caught up, can you re-test on RHS server to confirm that it is able to run on RHS server since the goal is to also migrate to RHS server as well.



Thanks!
