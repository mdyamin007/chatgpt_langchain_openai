I expect "April Notice | eNotices", but got "August Statement | eStatements".

comment: [~golam.azrin] I believe the browser title comes from the wrapper side, can you confirm? The html enotice is dated April 2022 however the title is showing August. Please take a look, thanks. Here's an account you can use to verify on sso stage: 568204836

comment: [~golam.azrin] [~Tin.Chak] This is the same issue as reported for a different bug. Please confirm what will be needed to fix this and timing; I may determine to move forward and fix post-launch depending on your update.
