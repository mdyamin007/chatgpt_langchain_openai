title: 19462 - BANB - Captcha not working
description: Client reported some users are occasionally receiving errors inputting the captcha code during enrollment. They claim an invalid error pops up when entering the code the first time, but after a while they can submit the same code again and proceed to the next step without changing anything.

In the hypercube logs, it looks like we only record the correct captcha code and not what the user enters in. In addition, there seems to be no additional log output after entering the code and clicking on 'I can see PDF'. *Can we add more print lines to show the user going through the captcha code steps during enrollment?*

I have added the log for users captcha e.g.

*info: demo server/methods.js :: enrollEstmtVerifyCaptchaCodeLog - actual captcha ' 62HtVP'*
 *info: demo server/methods.js :: enrollEstmtVerifyCaptchaCodeLog - inputCaptcha ' 62HtVP'*



Should I commit the log code on the trunk?

Let me know.



Thanks,
