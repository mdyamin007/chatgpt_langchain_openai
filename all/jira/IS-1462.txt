title: OSCU - Invoice- Visa PDFi Conversion to AFP2PDF Python [InHse]
description: Update existing processing script to no longer use PDFi tool to create pdf.
 Instead use afp2pdf.py program with index_build_multicore option for ALL statement related apps.
 The smaller daily notice jobs can use the current index_build options.

All the zip file, pgp encryption, index file contents, and PDF file naming convention must remain exactly the same original specifications.

Please ensure the standard SOP on the directory structure must be followed: 
 ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/pdf, ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/zip, ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/work is followed.
 Also, clear the folder directory folder before each processing. We do NOT want to accumulate previous runs.

The current program should support checking total PDF counts verification to make sure the expected pdf matches the total number for pdfs generated; If not, incorporate this standard verification logic

DT_JOB_ID:

Processing Scripts to modify:
oscumv2_process.sh

Data Files to use:



*NOTE*: This job runs on RH2. Since we are migrating from RHS to RH2, we should test all options so that we can do afpcompare and also ensure there is no errors in the processing logs.

Parallel ID: 20221015012546
production cycle: 09/30

Data files:
/z/dsi_pdfi_testing/oscumv2/data/OSCU_20220930_Monthly_Statement.xml.zip

old zips: /z/dsi_pdfi_testing/oscumv2/old/
new zips: /z/dsi_pdfi_testing/oscumv2/new/

*Notes:*
* Index file has the comma & space issue, but in this case, it correct
	* The index file we generated previously had comma in its value, which essentially changed the column's meaning

Thanks,
Anwar

I noticed in the new version, there is an extra ^M new line character:

!image-2022-10-17-09-34-52-265.png!



Can you remove the extra ^M line character for each of the individual txt file?

This issue also exists in the{{/z/dsi_pdfi_testing/oscumv2/new/oscu_mv2_09302022_1.zip}}version as well.

Please check.

comment: [~anwarh]: Great work! I don't see difference other than the expected global code issue with the truncation of the ',' character in the afp2pdf.py program. I'm surprised client did not report comma delimiter issue with their production files b/c there will be extra comma for name field. I will ask QA to resume and complete their thorough QA process.
