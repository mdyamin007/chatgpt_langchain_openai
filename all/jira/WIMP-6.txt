title: PDF Archival Global Packaging Module Update
description: In light of the recent level 3 data compromise issue with APCU, PRCU and recently with EWBB, we need to have standard packaging modules that does the checks and balancing to ensure no other client's data/files gets included inadvertently into the zip file.  Also, we need to add count validation logic as well.

4/1:  Nischala should be starting this project this month along side DSi.

4/15:  DSi did not give me code update yesterday (4/14).  Will follow-up as to why.

4/29:  Environment issue resolved last week.  Will do code review and merge code with Nischala in DEV environment.  Ernest mentioned that there is a new version of afp2web, but we may not release the more current version.

6/17:  Little behind schedule.  Working on bugs w/ DSi.

7/1:  I need to revise the live date of 7/22 by a month or so.  The server we are using to test this module is being used by GCBK archival recovery.  I will update revised live date after Quarter end is over to.

7/15:  GCBK archival process issue discovered last Friday and will need to redo much of the work from last week to this week.  Unfortunately another delay discovered.

7/22: Per William he was busy on another project and will need to pickup next week.


7/29:  Archivals are done w/ GCBK;  Now I can resume the testing/providing feedback of this project.  Hopefully I can resume mid-week;  Need to focus on the Message Manager Billing Portion of the project first

9/9:  We resumed starting this project back up last Thursday.

9/16:  WIP: Still working with Anwar on the feedback and bugs that we've identified

9/30:  WIP.

10/21:  Need to get with Shail on a new status update now that Message Manager is live.

12/16:  This project will need to be delayed.  Shail has a few BA projects and Sales/AM support ..

comment: 1/29 - Updated live date to *2/14* (tentative) due environment issue.

+*Details*+: The updated version of the afp2pdf code (*yaml module*) is not supported by InfoIMAGE old servers. Releasing this version of the code would impact 80-85 processing scripts that are currently running on RHS/RH2 prod server. We are working on an alternative solution so that code is backward compatible & can run on RHS/RH2 servers.
