title: BANB- CD - Commercial CD PDFi Conversion to AFP2PDF Python [InHse]
description: Update existing processing script to no longer use PDFi tool to create pdf.
 Instead use afp2pdf.py program with index_build_multicore option for ALL statement related apps.
 The smaller daily notice jobs can use the current index_build options.

All the zip file, pgp encryption, index file contents, and PDF file naming convention must remain exactly the same original specifications.

Please ensure the standard SOP on the directory structure must be followed: 
 ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/pdf, ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/zip, ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/work is followed.
 Also, clear the folder directory folder before each processing. We do NOT want to accumulate previous runs.

The current program should support checking total PDF counts verification to make sure the expected pdf matches the total number for pdfs generated; If not, incorporate this standard verification logic

DT_JOB_ID:



Processing Scripts to modify:
 /home/master/banb_ms1_cd_process.sh

Data Files to use:



*NOTE*: This job runs on RH2. Since we are migrating from RHS to RH2, we should test all options so that we can do afpcompare and also ensure there is no errors in the processing logs.

comment: Please pause on this banb ms1 cd project. I'm in the middle of fixing some report logic. Once done, i will let you know so that you can convert this PDFi logic to afp2pdf.py. I'm hoping to have this completed no later than Tuesday.

Parallel ID: 20221113143422
 production cycle: 11/01

Data files:
 /z/dsi_pdfi_testing/banbms1/data/BANB_CDROMstmts_20221101.zip.pgp

PDFs and index file in: /z/pdf_afp/banb/banbms1/pdf/

Notes:
 # I'm unable to check in the processing script because of your '20220824125108'
 # Replaced the `COMMERCIAL_CD.pl` command similar to what you've shown in htbkds2
 # I don't have that much knowledge of this `COMMERCIAL_CD.pl` script. I could only test up to the PDF and index generation step.
 # Please check the log file here. `/z/anwarH/log/bash.rhs.bak.log`, not sure about some of the errors.

Thanks,
 Anwar

*I've copied the following 3 files you need for this project:*

Please merge the logic for this project with the changes to the files above. Basically all the logic update I made above is related to[IS-1574] BANB - CD Commercial Report Automation for Accounting Dept In-Hse - Jira (infoimageinc.com)that was never QA'd.
