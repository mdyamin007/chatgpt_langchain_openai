comment: Hi [~tye.wu@infoimageinc.com]& [~Shun.Kuwashima]Electronic Parallel ticket 22771 has been opened in InfoCARE


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~MattL], are there any new notice descriptions we need to add? I see on the SOW that enotice 021 is now "split" into four different notices, however they all share the same letter code 021 still, so nothing changes on our end.

comment: [~tye.wu@infoimageinc.com], I talked to Matt and there's actually no updates/releases you need to do for this project. You can probably close this ticket out after parallel is done, however please double check with Matt first.
