title: SURU Statement Logo Removal from Paper
description: SURU Statements have a logo that is printing on paper in the body of the statement on the lower left. SURU would like to remove so it matches eStatements. We initially tried to get on eStatements but couldn't get the transparent logo to work. SURU opted to remove altogether. See attached example.
