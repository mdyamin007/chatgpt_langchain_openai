comment: [~thomasY], SEFC wanted to know why the date on the notices are April 13, 2019 instead of the file date or the date they were printed.




author: thomasy
comment: [~dyuen]File date will be whatever the processing date is when run in production. The date was just set to 2019 on the program locally when creating samples.
