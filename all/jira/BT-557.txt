title: Missing transactions in multipage document
description: In the project exported to QA (data fileWEST_dl_21062022mod.TXT).

Document #20:
!9 lines out of 12.png|width=579,height=270!

There are 9 items in the document, but there are 12 in the data file and, quite correctly, the total is shown as 12.

comment: I can imagine it's quite a headache trying to render this data. Maybe it's possible to run a check to compare the total number of lines in the notice against "... ITEMS FOR" line -- to create a log line for internal testing purposes?

comment: One more example - document #42 (13 items output instead of 18).

comment: Yes, indeed. It is very complicate to extract data from post card pages.
I'm reviewing this account.
