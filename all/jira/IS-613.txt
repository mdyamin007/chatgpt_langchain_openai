please attach SOW and request samples with endorsement.


author: jun
comment: [~barnetts] [~berezinez]

The update was for updating verbiage for the letters. Endorsement was originally not there. Please let me know which endorsement I should add?


author: barnetts
comment: [~jun]/[~berezinez],

I'm looking at the IS samples (IS-613_SSCU_Print samples 12082021.pdf) the signatures are there. What missing endorsement are you referring to [~berezinez]?

Thanks, Barnett 


author: berezinez
comment: [~barnetts]

I'm talking about the endorsement, not the signature...

comment: [~barnetts] [~jun]

Is there any update on the samples with Endorsement on them?


author: jun
comment: [~barnetts] [~berezinez]

I didn't update the endorsement. This ticket is for updating the body content of 3 existing letters. Either the SOW is incorrect or the scope of the work needs to change.


author: igor.khosid
comment: [~barnetts]

Any updates on the endorsement !


author: william.kong
comment: [~barnetts]: What Igor caught is not part of the scope of work; But indeed Igor pointed out an issue. Please provide a response on this today so that we can see if we can fit this in for [~jun]to address before the 12/17/2021 live date.


author: barnetts
comment: Hi All [~Igor.Khosid], [~berezinez] ,[~jun], and [~William.Kong],

Due to the short timeframe, lets skip the endorsement. I will open a separate ticket later on if we need to add the endorsement.

Thanks, Barnett

Please create a ticket to fix the endorsement issue,

and confirm with Calvin to release it without endorsement.
