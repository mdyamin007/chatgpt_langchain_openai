comment: [~mousumiS] [~fahad] There are issues with the print color of the header bars. I just sent an email on this - please check this with the screenshots from OPS, as it needs to be adjusted ASAP.

The samples are otherwise approved based on all data and/or mapping updates made for the last round of samples.

[~diegof] [~andreav] FYI


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~fahad] I sent a zoom message, but here is PDF and logo info from Wilson/Color print team. Please ensure that the header bars match this info.
