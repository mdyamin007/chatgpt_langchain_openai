title: SPCU - Hypercube Migration Analysis
description: Initial Findings:

This will be a straightforward Hypercube Migration. All processes on the PUI are already the latest standard.
 # Hypercube will be set up to allow connection from only NCR.
 # InfoTRAC will be updated to include all features available on Admin Site.

There only feature they won't have is Reminder Emails, but I haven't seen any of those in the past 90 days.

Please see attached for the color logo that's to be used.



Also, SPCU is stating that when they click on the drop down menu to display their accounts, it's reading "SF Police Credit Union", can you change to "The Police Credit Union"? They had a name change a couple of years ago.
