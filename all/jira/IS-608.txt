Hi Dawn, after finding that our request to suppress transactions with no description would impact other valid transactions we are going to pursue this change with Miser to see if we can get the data file fixed instead.  Please close this work order and I understand that we forfeit the cost unless there is any unused value that can be transferred to another workorder.  Thank you, Dan
