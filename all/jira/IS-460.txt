comment: Here is the client's feedback on the samples:

"Reduce logo size roughly 15-20% and add space between bottom of logo and top of address. Ideal is 1 "x" height of "Westerra" safe space around logo. Current logo is 2.16" wide, so there should be ample opportunity for resizing, and still maintaining legibility of logo."

Please let me know if we can resize the logo per their instruction.
