title: ca-preproc-pr-02: Unit Testing - Check Image Parsing
description: *Server IP:*

ca-preproc-pr-02.infoimageinc.com



*Description:*

Generally,+most+ of our check image processing program uses the standard check image perl program /home/master/get_chk_image.pl written by Joe Arcoraci. However, there are some that+may+ still be using a custom program:



*Objectives (Parallel Environment):*
 # Identify which clients are using a+custom+ check image parsing program outside. Please document into this ticket and also test each client for runnability and to confirm there is not missing perl modules.
 # Identify ALL clients using the standard check image module and identify all the 'unque' modules that are currently being used: (e.g.:COFF,FSRV,FSRV_BMS,Image
 ISR,JHA,JHA_EXT1,X937, X937_EXT1,X937_EXT2,X937_EXT3,X937_IRD,X937_WABC, etc etc.) Test each module to ensure there are no missing perl libraries or no error messages. Please document which clients you've tested.



*NOTE*: I did not create the CIDs in /z/ftpu /z/download/ /z/CID/ /z/daily/ /z/prep/CID /z/pdf_afp

In addition, if you are using the global check image parsing program, it will check for HOSTNAME=preprocessing02. Since the Brisbane preprocessing02 hostname does not match, you can run the following:
{noformat}
export HOSTNAME=preprocessing02{noformat}
Not all program will work using this hack. We are pending IBTL-10 to be completed in order to solve this hostname issue for any processing scripts in general.

comment: [~hkhosravani]: Peter would like you to test the check image processing. Please speak with him this week.



[~Peter.Dang]: Per our meeting today, this is your plan.

comment: [~hkhosravani] and [~Peter.Dang]: When do you guys think you can start testing this?

comment: I tested for htbk and it did not do anything after the following: no error logs and no tiff generated. I think it failed after unable to create download directory.

comment: [~yameelee]: I fixed the gpg issue and you can retest.



Here's what I did to permanently fix the issue:

On the new ca-preproc-pr-03 and ca-preproc-pr-02 Ubuntu server, it is using the newer version of gpg.

The /home/oper1/.gnupg needs to have a gpg.conf



Inside the gpg.conf:

pinentry-mode loopback



ONLY the new Ubuntu fresh install requires this step.

comment: [~hkhosravani]: Cool! Looks like you are making good progress!



[~yameelee]: Can you confirm that the HTBK check image pgp issue is resolved and HTBK is processing ok?


author: yameelee
comment: I processed multiple times, it did not create any check images.

log file has error below for all images.

author: william.kong
comment: [~yameelee] and [~Peter.Dang]: Can you guys review this issue together? I looked at the same log file:

/z/prep/htbk/log/error_log_20200901_182155_59.txt

and

/z/prep/htbk/tiff_parsing.log

But it's not giving me enough information as to what the issue is. Is it missing a mapping file/xref file? If it is a OS permission, missing directory, missing library issue, then I can assist.



Please advise.

comment: Hi Will, please disregard my previews comment. i used the server address that is provided in this ticket [ca-preproc-pr-02.infoimageinc.com]but that was the old preprocessing.

I processed MSBK again using the IP address provided in smartsheet [10.4.20.22]and now it encountered *+Image::Magick blob to image conversion error+*and none of the images were parsed.

see snapshot below:

comment: [~hkhosravani]: I've assigned this back to me for now. Will review after my internal calls.  Thanks!


author: william.kong
comment: [~hkhosravani] and [~yameelee]: I believe the issue is that i did not install the Tiff library and hence ImageMagic did not have the tiff "delegates". I had to install apt-get install libtiff-dev and re-compliled ImageMagick source code to get it installed.



Here's the before:

!image-2020-09-02-17-29-45-837.png!

Here's the results after I installed the tiff library and re-install ImageMagick:

comment: command i used for msbk:

/home/test/master/get_chk_image.pl -c msbk


author: hkhosravani
comment: msbk check image was processed successfully. image files created in/z/prep/msbk/tiff/ folder on server 10.4.20.22


author: hkhosravani
comment: Hi [~yameelee], Per Will please go ahead and reprocess HTBK to confirm if this has fix the issue for your process also.

Thanks!


author: william.kong
comment: [~yameelee]: Any updates on this check processing w/ HTBK? Please advise.


author: yameelee
comment: HTBK processed successfully. Error report matches production.

!image-2020-09-08-16-58-24-463.png|width=696,height=514!

CAMB got "Write failed: Broken pipe" error message, does not have summary and email at the end of process like HTBK. However, I checked the log directory and all the files matches production for the cycle.

comment: Will,

Per your request, I processed the same CAMB check image file on regular parallel environment.

No error. Processing time was less than 10mins

Whereas on Brisbane parallel, the first time was almost one hour before Kent rebooted - there were only 4k+ out of the 15k+ check images created at that time

The second time with the "Write failed: Broken pipe", process time was almost 2hours. All 15k+ check images were created.


author: william.kong
comment: [~yameelee] & [~hkhosravani]: Hi Guys, can you re-test the clients all over again. I had to downgrade ImageMagick version 7 to 6.9.  Version 7 is a lot slower than version 6. So I download the last version 6 (ImageMagick-6.9.11-29.zip)



I tested CAMB and it is a lot faster now which is close to 8min

Wed Sep 9 16:52:04 PDT 2020
Wed Sep 9 16:59:51 PDT 2020



Please check logs and also help me spot check "visually" a few of the tiff images between Menlo & Brisbane that they look the same.








author: yameelee
comment: I have reprocessed HTBK check images on brisbane parallel. Processing time is the same as previous process.

Spot checked a few images from HTBK and CAMB from menlo production and brisbane parallel, all images matched.


author: william.kong
comment: [~yameelee]: Thanks YaMee!



[~hkhosravani]: Please share your results as well, spot check and provide some benchmarking.


author: hkhosravani
comment: [~William.Kong]: MSBK on BB took 1 hour and 42 minutes where Menlo finished in 5 minutes. This was about 12.5K of images.


author: hkhosravani
comment: [~William.Kong] Ireprocessed on BB and this time only took less than 5 minutes.


author: william.kong
comment: [~yameelee] and [~hkhosravani]: I'm going to conclude and close this ticket out. Thanks for getting this system tested.
