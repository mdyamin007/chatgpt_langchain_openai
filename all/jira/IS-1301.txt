title: GCBK - [30037][pvt] Savings Link Notices - Updates
description: Below is the assessment and timeline. The print image file provided by bank for the Savings Link Fee Notice was good in terms of anchors. There were no issues and the current program was able to split the statements correctly as soon as I loaded it. Only issue is there appears to be non-ascii characters that are embedded in 2 locations of the data file and will need to be removed by their vendor. Please see images below and have client send a new test file with the non-ascii characters removed.



NON ASCII CHARCTER EMBEDDED IN 1st PARAGRAPH:

NON ASCII CHARACTER EMBEDDED IN LAST LINE OF LETTER:





ASSESSMENT:



Letter 21- (CSV Flat File) Update Savings Link Confirmation Notice template & Savings Link Cancellation Notice template:

Confirmation Template

-1hr to update verbiage per word doc template & change location of Notice Date + Account Number from upper right of page to left side of page right above body header.

Cancellation Template

-1hr to update verbiage per word doc template & change location of Notice Date + Account Number from upper right of page to left side of page right above body header.



Letter 22- (Print Image File) Update Savings Link Fee Notice:

-1hr to update dfa print image logic to correctly capture new format of intro paragraphs. Right now it is set to capture 1 paragraph (old format). Change location of Notice Date + Account Number from upper right of page to left side of page right above body header. Add account holder name after letter greeting "Dear"

-1hr to test anchors



4hrs + 1 hr testing

TOTAL= IS 5hrs no ISD hours needed



TIMELINE:

Turnover = 7/1

Sample to QA = 7/12

Sample to Client = 7/13

Sample Approval = 7/15

Parallel = 7/18

Live Date = 7/22

Programmer = Jason





NOTES FOR DEVELOPER (PLEASE ADD TO JIRA IS STORY):

Letter 21= GCBKDL021.dfa & is very easy to modify. This is a csv flat file. Just follow and make the verbiage & format changes described on the word doc for each corresponding template.

Letter 22= GCBKDL022.dfa & is a print image file and anchors must be tested thoroughly. There were no changes made to anchors and new file was able to load successfully into current dfa, therefore anchor testing should be successful. Change dfa logic in which theSTART_BODYvariable stores the beginning part of the letter right above the transactions. Currently this is set to store 1 paragraph (old format), modifications must be made to store "Dear" greeting plus the two separate paragraphs following the greeting.

The client provided the attached document with some changes they would like applied and new samples provided.  They will be submitting a new Fee Notice file after they make some adjustments on their side as well.  [^Savings Link Sample Feedback - Round 1.docx] Please see their response below.

Attached are some changes needed from round 1 of testing.  
Also, I need to update a couple spots on the "Fee Notice" file, so will need to work with our Deposit team and Fiserv to get you a new test file for that one for the next sample set.

comment: [~jasonV], please see below feedback from GCBK:



The latest samples were reviewed. The Confirmation & Cancellation Notices (sample file gcbkdl021) look good. Can you post a couple e-notice samples of these to pilot please?



The Fee Notice (sample file gcbkdl22) has some spacing issues in the top section which are highlighted below. Need a space inserted in those areas.

!image-2022-07-21-14-25-14-004.png!

Once you re-run these, if you could also post a few e-notices to pilot that would be great.

Once both are looking good, I will have you mail physical copies again with the envelopes since we moved the date and account # fields around again.



Do we need [~Shun.Kuwashima]/ISD's assistance with posting a few notices to pilot?

author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~jasonV], GCBK updated the ticket with the following:

While reviewing the physical samples, the starting position of the Date/Account # is different between the notices; therefore, the Savings Link Fee Notice shows the Account# in the window when we did the tap test.

We want to keep the starting line/position of the Date/Account# & Title Bar consistent between all the notices as we transition that data to the left in prep for the new letterhead.

When I look back at the collection notices we just implemented (which we didn't receive the physical copies inside the envelopes for), it seems like those start a few lines further down from the address lines. Could you update these three Savings Link Notices to mirror the same starting position as those?

Then send us new physical samples of all six so we can do the tap test and verify they better align?
 * Savings Link Notices for Confirmation, Cancellation, Fee
 * Collection Notices for 22, 29 & Suspend



Can you and [~Tevis Mak] [~SamV2021] confirm if these two fields start in the same position?

[~berezinez] [~rodriguez] FYI


author: JIRAUSER10906
comment: [~dyuen] [~jasonV] [~Tevis Mak]

I can confirm that the vertical starting position of the 'Notice Date'/'Date' for all the Collection Notices are the same (3.5 inches from the top). The account # and title bar are also after the notice date, which is the same as Jason's Savings Link Notices.

Thanks,
Sam

comment: Hi [~jasonV], [~SamV2021], [~Tevis Mak]
 # Please make the necessary adjustments to all letters. Please make them consistent if they are not already.
 # Request print samples and make sure QA does the proper tap test AND it passes.
 # If if does not pass tap test, keep trying until it does pass tap test
 # Do not provide AC DPVS for client print sample until everything is perfect and squared away.
 # If you need any help please call me.

Although my collection notices were not specified by the client (letter ids 8A, 8B, 8C, 15A, 15B, 15C), we should still perform tap test for them. Here is the DPVS for the first set of collection notices (GCBKDL023):[^gcbkdla102.print]

 * DPVS:[^gcbkdla102.print]
 * FILENAME:gcbkdla1024.2o1.afp

 * TRAY 1 STOCK: 3461

comment: Thanks [~jasonV] [~Tevis Mak]and [~SamV2021]!



I requested OPS to send physical print samples for GCBK to review.

*Jason*, we'll need to hold off on parallel until we have their OK.


author: JIRAUSER11003
comment: [~dyuen]please let me know when to continue to the parallel tests. Thanks!


author: dyuen
comment: [~jasonV] [~Tevis Mak] [~SamV2021], the physical samples were approved.

*Jason*, please proceed with parallel and confirm when we can go live.

*Sam/Tevis*, let me know what we need to do with your adjustments if at all.



Per GCBK:

"The new physical copies have been reviewed and look good.

We are okay to move forward with the changes to the Savings Link notices. Please let me know what the new production date will be as I will need to move the changes for the Fee Notice into Production the night before the live date since this notice uses a Fiserv file.

Also, thanks for sending the Collection Notices so we could review those. These look good as well, so do not require any adjustments. "
