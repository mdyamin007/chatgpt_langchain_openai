title: 15342 / 48212 - SFCE - Update ECL Process
description: SFCE has ECL setup, but they can't used the DefaultHandler anymore.

Need to move to DefaultHandler4 (standard anyway). And the columns should be CIF|AcctNum|email (order doesn't matter).

Work with IS, since the ECL files will be coming from them.
