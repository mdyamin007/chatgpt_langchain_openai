comment: [~yameelee]: I believe the issue is with the CVSROOT system variable:

!image-2020-09-15-14-16-12-219.png!

It's hardcoded with an IP address.

Can you modify your ~/.bash_profile on the Menlo Park account and Brisbane Account?

Please change it to CVSROOT="ca-rcs-pr-01.infoimageinc.com:/extra/is_cvs".



Logout and log back in to both your Menlo and Brisbane account.

Test+both+ Menlo and Brisbane to make sure it works. If it does work, then I need to notify the ENTIRE team to update their profile.



Please advise.



Thanks!

comment: [~yameelee]: I'm going close this ticket out since we did all our testing from yesterday. I will send two global emails to the team.  1 today to tell them to update the /etc/profile to change CVSROOT to ca-rcs-pr-01



The 2nd email will be during conversion weekend to rename the /home/$USER/cvs to /home/$USER/cvs.backup; create a new /home/$USER/cvs folder and start from scratch.
