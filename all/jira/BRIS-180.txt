title: ca-preproc-pr-03 /d/partition creation request (VxRail)
description: [~premraj.patil]: For Brisbane, preprocessing03 (i.e. ca-preproc-pr-03) will need the big data partition instead of preprocessing02 (i.e. ca-preproc-pr-02).



I will need a /d/ partition for writing individual pdf since this is the new current afp2web server.



Let's try using VxRail since there is a lot of individual files it creates into /d/pdf_afp/

[~kent.chan]: Please advise if you agree with me to use pdf_afp under VxRail for ca-preproc-pr-03.

comment: [~premraj.patil]: Per our conversation just now, i've renamed /d to /d_old; Please create a 2TB /d partition on ca-preproc-pr-03.



Thanks!

comment: [~premraj.patil]: I confirmed this is done. You extended to 8TB since that was how it was originally created earlier this year. Thanks!
