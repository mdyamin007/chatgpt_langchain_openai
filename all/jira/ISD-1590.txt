description: Approval: 1/27

comment: FFIN wants an External Enrollment Report with the custom fields:
Account Name|Account Type|Account Number|eStatement/print indicator

Modified EnrollmentReportCU.java file's customEnrollmentReport function to allow Account_Owner_Name to be taken in and replaced (previously there was no ability to add in account_owner_name into a customer header format.

Inside ffin.conf file the important configurations to have are:
enrollment.customHeader=NAME|ACCOUNT_TYPE|ACCOUNT_NUMBER|DELIVERY_PREF
enrollment.customFormat=${name}|${acct_type}|${acct_number}|${delivery_pref}
