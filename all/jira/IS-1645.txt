comment: [~tanmay] Sorry for the delay. VWCU has some accounts that need to be mapped to a different account number for posting. They would like to use this attached file - if there is a match to the data file in column 1, they would like it posted to account # in column 2. This will be a required file when processing their electronic statements.

Please confirm if this is possible to include for the setup in order to still go live 11/10. If not, we will handle manually separately for the live date.

comment: Hi [~tanmay]

I am attaching the list of all the accounts from last year provided by the client, but many of them cannot be found on the pilot site, so we would like to reconfirm the test file that you used for posting.

Please provide a copy of the data file which you have used for creating the index file for the current project. 

Thank you!

Hi [~tanmay], can you check the afp files again? They seem small, and it wasn't able to pull up a pdf as it failed to open.

comment: [~tanmay] We jumped on a call with the customer because they could not see the eStatements in pilot site for the EA file. We found that the PDF file contains the member number suffix as the last two digits.

Is it possible to update the program to strip the last 2 digits of the 'Loan Number' found in the PDF for posting to the index file?

Example: Loan Number in PDF file = 59026{color:#FF0000}92{color}

Remove the '92' for the eStmt index file for posting so that it uses: 59026 (which is the true member number tied to this EA statement).

VWCU confirmed that all accounts contain the 2 digit suffix. You do not need to change how the Loan Number is displayed on the actual PDF statement/cover sheet, only for eStatement posting/index file for the removed suffix.

Please let us know if any questions and how quickly this can be updated to create a new index file for pilot site posting.



Thanks,

Phoebe/Juliana

comment: [~tanmay] The posting itself seems to look ok, but VWCU is having an issue viewing the accounts on pilot via their Online Banking. ISD is looking into this and we are waiting for response from their vendor.
