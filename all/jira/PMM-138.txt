title: Personal Pilot Site for Clients - Sandbox? - EWBB and IDCU
description: Tyler  Please add this request to the Product Meeting.

IDCU and EWBB currently access our pilot site for training employees and viewing files.

They both have been doing this for years. We allowed them to use the site this way and down bc of all the times the site is down they are complaining.

Internal answer has been  the pilot site shouldnt be used that way. However its hard to say this to clients that have been using it this way for years.

My request is to move them to their own pilot site that doesnt have to come down each time we work in pilot mode. We would be able to charge a small monthly fee for this service.

Im open to any other suggestion the team my come up with.

Both EWBB and IDCU are Key Accounts.

thanks

comment: We have ruled that we will be finding a solution to this. In the meantime, we will be more transparent in update schedules as well as find an interim solution that allows us to not make updates during business hours.



We will find a permanent solution but that is tbd
