title: ELCU - StmtPDFi Conversion to AFP2PDF Python [InHse]
description: Update existing processing script to no longer use PDFi tool to create pdf.
 Instead use afp2pdf.py program with index_build_multicore option for ALL statement related apps.
 The smaller daily notice jobs can use the current index_build options.

All the zip file, pgp encryption, index file contents, and PDF file naming convention must remain exactly the same original specifications.

Please ensure the standard SOP on the directory structure must be followed: 
 ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/pdf, ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/zip, ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/work is followed.
 Also, clear the folder directory folder before each processing. We do NOT want to accumulate previous runs.

The current program should support checking total PDF counts verification to make sure the expected pdf matches the total number for pdfs generated; If not, incorporate this standard verification logic

DT_JOB_ID:
 133563-C01.01-V21366

Processing Scripts to modify:
 elcums1_process.sh

Data Files to use:
 "ELCU_STMT.EOM.20210501.zip.pgp, ELCU_STMT.RGE.20210501.zip.pgp"



*CUSTOM LOGIC FOR ELCUMS1:*

**Add the following argument to the afp2pdf.py index_build_multicore; elcums1 has eStatement so we should match the quality and results with their eStatement version hence requesting adding the following argument since PDF archival has color as well.

Colorspace=RGB



*NOTE*: This program runs on RH2 and will need to be tested on RHS server since we are going to migrate RH2 to RHS server.

comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid]

This is an in-house project. We are converting pdfi to afp2pdf. In pdfi style pdf and index file for archival were created from dfa but now it will be from the script.

Parallel id:20210524063544

ELCUMS11.zip is in qa folder.

Archival sample is/z/dsi_pdfi_testing/elcums1/split_by_count/new/ELCU_STMT.EOM.20220602 folder generated fromELCU_STMT.EOM.20210228.zip.pgp.

Let me know if you need anything else.



Thanks

comment: [~rony]: Please ensure ELCUMS1 is ran on the same server as prod. When doing the afpcompare, we noticed that the afp file has a significant amount of shifting. So I compared /home/keep/elcums1.ran with /home/test/keep/elcums1.ran and noticed that you ran parallel in rhs2 instead of rh2. I'm thinking the papyrus version is significantly different causing such a large shifting of data:



I showed [~Igor.Khosid]a prototype PDF comparison tool and noticed a huge shift in the positioning:

\\ca-isshare-01.infoimageinc.com\ac-secure-share\is\williamK\elcums1_pdf_compare.zip

If you unzip the file above, you will see thediff_elcums1_541003289745_05312022_82185.pdf.pdf result diff file. Look at how much vertical spacing difference it is. I do expect some shifting of data, but not this much.



Can you re-run in parallel on rh2 so that we can re-analyze this job again?

comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid]

Would you please check again with pdf compare to check if the result is better?

Thanks


author: william.kong
comment: [~rony]: I hate to ask this, but can you run again in parallel, but this time with rh2 using the new afp2pdf program. The data still looks shifted and I'm curious as to why their is still a vertical line space discrepancy.

comment: [~rony]: I've tested comparing via pdf_compare.pl utility with the latest version in with theColorspace=RGB option to afp2pdf. Because PDFi version color is slightly different, the pdf_compare.pl utility complained all the PDFs. This is expected b/c of the color difference. At least with theColorspace=RGB option, it matches with the eStatement version. The next steps is with QA team to do the other QA checks.



[~Igor.Khosid]: Results are in a different server:

comment: [~rony]: Extreme apologies again! As mentioned last thursday, I will need to ask for to run the+3rd+ and final time in paralllel for cycle 7/31/2022. We did not have the production AFP file b/c of a bug in the global isisdisk.sh script. We fixed it on 7/29 so we definitely have it backed up now in /d/afpformat/2412972_elcums1231.afp

I took the liberty to copy the file to/z/infoftp_int/osiw/elcu/ so that it can be scanned.



Can you please change Jira ticket status back to "QA Request" since we need to redo the test results again.

comment: [~Andrey.Kutsenko]: Sorry for the delay! I've been troubleshooting elcums1 since you reported the numerous differences Tuesday evening.

I've added an exclusion list file to ignore certain areas in the PDF statements (e.g. logo, upper red bar, and Page 1 middle bar).
