description: Improving security scanning by doing both vulnerability and pen testing

comment: * They do not do vulnerability scans at least annually, although they indicated they do at least annual pen tests. Not sure if this was answered No in error. The pen test can be an uplift of vulnerability scanning but most orgs do both and limit pen testing to high risk technology
 ** InfoIMAGE is in the process of improving its security scanning by doing both vulnerability and pen testing. We anticipate this to be in place by Q3 2021
