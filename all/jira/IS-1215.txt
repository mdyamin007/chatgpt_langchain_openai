title: WHCU - StmtPDFi Conversion to AFP2PDF Python [InHse]
description: Update existing processing script to no longer use PDFi tool to create pdf.
 Instead use afp2pdf.py program with index_build_multicore option for ALL statement related apps.
 The smaller daily notice jobs can use the current index_build options.

All the zip file, pgp encryption, index file contents, and PDF file naming convention must remain exactly the same original specifications.

Please ensure the standard SOP on the directory structure must be followed: 
 ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/pdf, ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/zip, ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/work is followed.
 Also, clear the folder directory folder before each processing. We do NOT want to accumulate previous runs.

The current program should support checking total PDF counts verification to make sure the expected pdf matches the total number for pdfs generated; If not, incorporate this standard verification logic

DT_JOB_ID:
 133583-C30.01-V21623

Processing Scripts to modify:
 whcuds1_process.pl

Data Files to use:
 WHCU_STMT_06092022_1



*NOTE*: This job runs on RH2. Since we are migrating from RHS to RH2, we should test all options so that we can do afpcompare and also ensure there is no errors in the processing logs.

comment: [~anwarh]: Did you run all job_sel options? I don't see the big afp file in the /z/afpformat folder? I would like to run AFPCompare cycle 8/20? Please update QA Request status when you have ran all job_sel options in parallel in RHS server.

comment: Hi [~William.Kong], re ran with all job sel, Please test now. Thanks

comment: Sorry[~anwarh]! The AFP compare testing failed because of message mismatch. I also go other weird afp compare issues as well too:



!image-2022-08-23-15-10-36-659.png|width=652,height=242!



!image-2022-08-23-15-11-21-960.png|width=679,height=288!





I've updated the parallel message manager to+match+ up the messages. Because of the other weird non-matching issues seen above, I need to find out if there are more odd ball issues. Because every page has mis-match message error messages, I need to make sure it message area is matching to identify what other mismatches that I may possibly excuse.



Please re-run+all+ job_sel again on rhs server.

Please use+latest+ production:

[williamK@rhs2 whcuds1]$ perl /home/util/get_processed_filename.pl prod whcu 2418314
 cid: whcu
 jid: ds1
 proc_id 2418314
 file_name: {color:#ff0000}*WHCU_STMT_08222022_1*{color}
 md5 2d98a7acebb16921e6fe468f160db95a



I've copied the production file in red to/z/infoftp_int/whcu/Monthly/ so that it get scanned in parallel.



Please also change status to "QA Request" when completed. Thanks!



Thanks!



 Will

[~anwarh]: Per [~Andrey.Kutsenko]can you re-generate the parallel 8/22/2022 pdf files. Unfortunately, [~rony] ran whcu in parallel and overwrote your PDF files in /z/pdf_afp/whcu/whcuds1/pdf folder the week of Sept 1 when you last ran the job on 8/24.



I believe I've backed up 8/22 prod output so i still have it in ca-isis-pr-04:/d/pdf_compare/whcuds1_prod/ so that we can.



Please update status back to "QA Request" when you have it done.

When time permits, please test this application.

comment: [~anwarh]: Please move forward with code release! Please don't forget to update the procedure file to reflect processing server to be on RHS. As usual, please cc me in the communication so that I can coordinate with DP as well too. I will mark live date to be 9/20 for now.

comment: Hi [~anwarh],

Following codes have been released.



FYI: I foundwhcu_pdfi_idx_split.pl in your actual xfer/ folder (/d/is/cvs/xfer/anwarH/). So I temporary remove for releasing following files and put back to your xfer folder. Please release accordingly.
