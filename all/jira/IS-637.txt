comment: [~jharvey] - I've placed the archival sample - EQBK_EA_Archival_11232020_1.zip in your AC Secure Shared directory. I updated the date field in the index file to format mmddyyyy. 
I processed cycle 11/19 for samples but  they haven't fixed the address issue in the data file yet so the first line of the address isn't being displayed on the pdfs.
