Do we have an ETA on samples for today?

comment: Hi [~Jessica]

Since [~Kbittmann]is offline now providing sample to you.

For now the sample is disregarding the account list client provided. It would be help if client can suggest some data file to run where I can find accounts from the account list client provided in comment 1 in ts .



sample is/d/ac-secure-share/ac/kris/snfbs01.pdf



Thanks

Not sure if you also told the client that the sample is not respecting the account list and if the client can provide us a data file to test the account list would be helpful.

Thanks

Parallels 30251 and 30252 created.

comment: [~Kbittmann] FYI: I merged my code with Rony's as we are going live at the same time. Please let me know if parallel can wait until tomorrow for both inserts or if you want to start parallel with Rony's first then mine after.

comment: [~rony], SNFB DDA does have archival. When I ran it, it complains - *E058: Resource (S1SNFBB5) not found*

I have copied the resource to preprocessing02. It should work as all other inserts I added I copied them there and they are good.

We can release Rony update and then yours.


author: yameelee
comment: [~Kbittmann] both codes are merged in parallel environment right now and both needs to go LIVE tomorrow. I think it will be more of a hassle to release and roll back multiple codes. It is better to release at the same time. But if client said it's ok to delay my insert then we will have Rony release his codes only that doesn't have mine.



I was going to bypass parallel on mine anyway and review on production as we do not have time for this last minute update. But we do need to have QA done and client approval.



Let me know if Rony's passed parallel.
