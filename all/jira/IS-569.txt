Ran the process with latest updates.

Attached is the DPVS.[^pfcums1131.print]

Afp file name:/z/afp/pfcu/pfcums11314.2o1.afp

Print range: 1-20

Please check the logo color of subsequent page of any customer statement.

Sample is at/z/download/pfcu/pfcums11314.2o1.pdf

File size is too big to upload in jira.

So I copied the sample pdf in/z/infoftps4/pfcu/client_pickup/pfcums11314.2o1.pdf

Please check.

Thanks

comment: Hi Mahbub,

Here is client's feedback:

"
1) The muted color logo does not exactly hit what we were hoping to achieve.  Originally, we were worried about bleed through when using the full color logo, but are not worried about that any longer.  Please use the normal full color logo, that is presently used on the front page, on all subsequent pages as well (for all statement applications).  Sorry for the multiple iterations, but we just feel that will look better.

2) The change to the summary of accounts is a nice improvement.  We noticed two things:

* The example on page 24770 appears to have the text all the way to the left edge of the shaded area, whereas the other statements without account aggregation have a little margin on the left edge which looks better.  Please use the same left margin for the aggregated account statements as is presently used for the non-aggregated summaries.

* The default name for appl-code 2 should be 'Certificates' instead of CD when aggregating the summary page.  If the default of 'CD' is used elsewhere in the programming, please let me know as we need to change that per legal naming requirements.

3) Summary of Checks Paid change look perfect

They are talking about this logo, which is already being used in the 1st page of the statement.



!https://app.na3.teamsupport.com/dc/1888578/images/6ac3b77d-eb51-4cc8-980d-26590ae08f27.png! 



They just want this logo to be used for subsequent pages from now on.

But I have a question for them. Do they want the return address beside the logo for subsequent pages? I am asking this because the return address is a part of the logo, not text from our program. And the earlier logo in subsequent pages didn't used to have the return address.

Thanks

comment: Hi Mahbub,

Here is client's comment .  See comment #74 in TS #23904 for the screen shots.

"
Logo and Certificates text looks good.  There is still something odd about the left margin/padding on the summaries with aggregated accounts compared to the other summaries with no aggregation.  We would like the same padding to be used on the aggregated accounts that is in place on the original summaries.

Aggregated Summary with no padding between the start of the shading and text:
Summary with preferred padding between shading and text on left edge:

comment: Hi Mahbub,
Please remove the 's.  See comment #83 in TS#23904.

"The latest revision to fix the margin padding looks good.  However, it seems like they are using a different template for the aggregated summaries.  For the non-aggregated, it states 'Deposit Account Total' at the bottom and for the aggregated, it states 'Deposit Account Totals'with an S).  Please remove the 's' from the Deposit Account Totals text on the aggregated summaries."

Thanks.

comment: DPVS provided for the print samples are pretty old from 11.29.2021 and have not presented actual updates; therefore, they can't be used for parallel testing.
 The parallel testing needs to be the print with the most current version.

comment: [~mahbubS] I uploaded the resource file just now, do you have an index file we can post onto pilot/stage so that we can verify?

[~dawnl] Since this requires a resource upload from ISD, can you create an ISD story and assign to me if this requires estatement verification?
