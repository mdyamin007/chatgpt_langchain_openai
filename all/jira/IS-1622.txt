DT_JOB_ID: 133810-C31.01-V22715.
In the Infotrac (stage)--For the Paper job posted ,zip is not captured in the column even though the data is available. Account is displayed as "0" instead of the value

comment: [~gthillaivel] In general, ISD does not deal with the Paper job details on Job Status. Please ask IS.

comment: Hi,

For DT_JOB_ID: 133810-C31.01-V22715.
In Infotrac (stage) now the account number is displayed as expected.

Generally 'Zip' is only visible for the 'Presort' accounts but not for the 'First Class' accounts.

Thanks.
