title: 10.4.10.###:  Temporary Linux Server (secure4)
description: [~kent.chan]: Can we have a temporary Linux server with some storage to store files for client_pickup folders. I need to replicate a linux version of the secure4. In this file server, we do+not+ need FTP services installed. 

It will need NFS port access.



{color:#de350b}+*8/18 Additional Specifications:*+{color}
 # {color:#de350b}Need SSH port access between 10.4.20.### to 10.4.10.10{color}
 # {color:#de350b}Create a williamK user w/ sudoer admin access.{color}





Also, it looks like you secure5 will be a VM. Can we migrate secure5 to get it setup permanently to use?

Secure5 is a production box utilized by only 1 client (SANA), they had very specific SSH protocol needs.



Anyway, I have created a test box to test movement of files

ca-s4ftptest-dv-01 10.4.10.10

What credentials do you need created for yoru testing. rh1login?



EDIT- I'm not as smart as i thought i was...haha. I can't get firewall rule to allow internal (10.4.20) NFS traffic to the DMZ. Going to need Ferhat's help on this one.

comment: Will- This works and I am closing the ticket. Please let me know if you need further assistance on this one

comment: [~kent.chan]: My apologies. I was not specific in my instructions to also include SSH port access and a sudo user williamK so that I can create folders and enable NFS access/install NFS. I will update the description now with these two additional steps in red font. 



Also, I added this 10.4.10.10 ip address to the Brisbane Server list so that we can remember why we created and the fact that we need to 'delete' after Brisbane conversion weekend.

SSH between 420 and 410 is done. williamK user on the sftp4 testing server is created.

comment: [~premraj.patil]: I cannot ssh from 10.4.20.### to 10.4.10.10 server. Can you double-check Kent's brisbane firewall setting.



This is a "temporary" secure4 & secure5 linux file server to test placing files into client_pickup folder.



[~davidt] & [~kent.chan]: Just a FYI. Per our meeting today, David needs access to some of the ftp server. This is one that was temporarily setup, but I never had a chance to configure.

comment: [~premraj.patil]: I forgot to include a screenshot of my troubleshooting:



on ca-isis-pr-01 (10.4.20.31) I cannot connect to port 22 10.4.10.10:

!image-2020-09-22-17-41-54-770.png!



Also NFS needs to be opened too:

ca-isis-pr-##

ca-preproc-pr-##

comment: [~premraj.patil]: Thanks for sneaking in the help late last night during your late evening call w/ Ferhat and team.



[~davidt]: Can you give me the list server names so that i can add your servers to the /etc/export list. This will be for secure4 & secure5 linux FTP servers:

!image-2020-09-23-08-28-48-839.png!



NFS ports needs to be opened to 10.4.10.10

You will also need to TEMPORARILY update you /etc/hosts file to point secure4 and secure5 to this 10.4.10.10.

comment: [~davidt]: Temporarily re-assigning back to me. I thought it was working so I'm retesting again.


author: william.kong
comment: [~davidt]: Ok.. got it to work and had to some manually work to create empty directory for secure4 and secure5.



Please advise which system needs access to secure4 and secure5 and I will add it into the /etc/exports file.



Thanks!
