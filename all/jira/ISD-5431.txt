I forgot to mention, that i verified using method Daily, all existing ones only have Daily Due method, When i tried to use Any Time or Weekly i had error, may be I need different pattern for it, but I did not have example.

The error I had for Any Time and Weekly occurred because of reusing same CID number when submitting form. Verified with not existing CID in Application Management and it works with no error.
