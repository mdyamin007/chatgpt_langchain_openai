Please refer to the description.
There are 2 separate updates. I for print and another for ISD.
Print: Update Statement backer with new Backer
ISD: Update "Stmt Disclosure" in eSite

The ISD update involves updating the "Stmt Disclosure" in the statement tab. (Please refer to screenshot) The updated disclosure is the updated backer that is attached to this ticket. There are no needs for account numbers since it is the discourse tab pdf that is being updated. 

The print sample is not ready, however that is a completely different from this since the statement backer doesn't get carried over to the eSide.
