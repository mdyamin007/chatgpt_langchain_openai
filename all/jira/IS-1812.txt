[~Igor.Khosid]: created 19 psegs - 10 for individual and 9 for business.

Note: I updated the script to move the previous process to backup instead of removing, as we need both processes. Files in /z/yearly/ewbbyta/backup/ are for version 1 (individual). Files in /z/yearly/ewbbyta/ are for version 2 (business).

This job only has archival and paper.

archival PDFs are as below:

/z/yearly/ewbbyta/backup/Farhan_W8BEN_2022_Archive_1.pdf

/z/yearly/ewbbyta/Farhan_W8BEN_2022_Archive_2.pdf



[~kdishroon]: attached DPVS.

[^ewbby116.print]is for version 1 individual w8ben (10 images per account)

[^ewbby117.print]is for version 2 business w8bene (9 images per account)

The .is file only has one account so if you need more, you will need to request from the 4.2o1 file. You can get image range by every 10 images for indiv and every 9 images for business for however many accounts needed, but each account should be exactly the same.

comment: [~kdishroon] Forgot to mention, for ewbby116.print (business),USANG INDUSTRIAL CO LTD appears twice in the data file, so two statements are created for this business, but they are household together so it went into the heavy file.
