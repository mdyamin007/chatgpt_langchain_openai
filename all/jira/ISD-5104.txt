comment: Adding User Role "Report User".

Please, use an InfoIMAGE user to create a Report User. and then logs in as the Report User to validate privileges.

The Report User should have access to Account Management and Reports. For Account Management, the Report User should not have access to restricted accounts. following are the restricted account numbers:2257008017,2257008207
