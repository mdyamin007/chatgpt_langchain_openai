OFCU approves of the samples. Please provide IS -Checklist for [~Igor.Khosid]
Since a parallel is not required, hopefully this can be released quickly without issues. 

Thanks, Barnett

comment: [~jira_naru] - do we need to check on eSite as well, because of the new OVL's?



author: jira_naru
comment: [~Igor.Khosid]:

No, the issue only occurs for PDF archival. So, the new resource is for PDF archival.

No, new resource for eSTMT.
