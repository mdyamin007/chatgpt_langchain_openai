title: INHS - Update Personalization Document
description: Please work with Dania to update the personalization document to the latest hypercube site. Update screenshots and add in other personalization options that are available. See attached confluence page for the version we have now. Create the updated version on confluence so we can easily make updates and reuse.

comment: Hi Joe,

The page itself shows nothing (we need to click on view from the attachment to view on confluence). Should we add the details on confluence page or update the current docx file and upload as a new version (keep it similar as currently it is).



Would you please create an account for Dania. She was trying to sign up and could not login with confirmation email.

comment: Add the details on the confluence page so that it's similar to the docx file. This will allow us to make changes and easily export it to PDF as needed.
