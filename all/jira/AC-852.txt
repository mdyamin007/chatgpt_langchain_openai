Upon analysis of_EQBK_DDA_09302021.DAT_, it appears that the transaction is not appearing on the statement because in our program, this particular transaction does not fit into the existing criteria of what should be added to the "Checks Paid Electronically" section.



The existing criteria is as follows (all must be met):

1) A Debit transaction with an associated check number

2) A section code (extracted from the data) of 'ARC', 'POP', 'POS', 'RCK', 'BOC' or 'PPD'

   OR an empty section code with a transaction description of 'ACH Payment'



The transaction in question -- CITIBANK MASTERC BILL PFY -- has an empty section code with a transaction description of 'Bill Pay Withdrawal'. Meanwhile, the transaction that is being displayed on the statement provided -- BLUE CROSS BLUE BILL PAY -- has a section code of 'PPD'. I have attached screenshots of these 2 transactions in the data file for your convenience.
