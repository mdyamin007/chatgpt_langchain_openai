Hi [~phoebe.george], In the last column of sow its given that all paper will be printed but if there is asterisk sign or DO not mail in address line should we suppress it? Currently we are supprressing it for letter 038, 039, 040

comment: [~Najoa] the last column is referencing whether or not the notice should have an electronic/eNotice version.

This is different than the 'print suppression', which would apply to any notice that is printing. That references this criteria:

There should be more than 3 notices that are PAPER only (which is N in last column on the letter matrix). These are notices with no account number in data, so we cannot post to electronic without account number.



Let me know if any questions. Thanks!
