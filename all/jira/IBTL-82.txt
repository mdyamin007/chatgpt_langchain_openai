comment: [~surekha.dani]: Please confirm which protocol you are using: Is it CIFS or NFS?



In addition, please confirm which system (i.e source IP) that I need to give permission to access.



Once you have the specification, can you please re-assign this task to me so that I can get this executed.

comment: [~surekha.dani]: My apologies. At the time of when you reported this issue, I control who has access to rhstore:/d/isd_share/; Now that /d/isd_share resides in isilion, i will need Prem's assistance to add your two servers



[~premraj.patil]: Can you please add permission for ISD on this directory:

*ca-isilon02-nfs:/rhstore/isd_share (rw)*

Source IP addresses are ca-elk-pr-01,ca-elk-pr-02.

Once updated, please assign ticket for Surekha to confirm if it is working.



thanks!

comment: Hi Prem,

       On ca-elk-pr-01/02, I have created the mount point on*/d/isd_share*which mounts to*ca-rhstore-pr-01:/d/isd_share*

I'm not able to get into the wecu directory underca-rhstore-pr-01:/d/isd_share/wecu - can you please check if there is any read write permission issue ?**

comment: HI Surekha,

The uid & gid & permission are exactly the same between Menlo and Brisbane:

*MENLO:*

*BRISBANE:*

Please check the your uid & gid in Menlo that you currently using and the you have the same uid & gid when accessing Brisbane.



Thanks!

comment: Hi Will,

        I'm able to access the /d/isd_share/wecu directory now. This morning the rwx permission was not there, but now I'm able to access.



Morning Screen shot: The permission on wecu directory was 700 (read write execute only for owner)

!image-2020-11-16-17-08-16-390.png!

Now the permission of wecu folder got updated to 777 (read write execute for everyone)
