title: SFCE - Map 2 transaction types.
description: Have a look at the Current Logic,


*IF[PostingDateislessthanorequal2020-10-25]*
*Then*
*IF[Category==Payment]*
*Then*
       *Category+FROM+Description+TRANSACTIONSERIAL+TransactionSerial*
*ElseIF[Category==Advance&TransferOptionisnotEmpty]*
*Then*
       *Category+TransferOption+TransferIdCategory+TransferId+Description+TRANSACTIONSERIAL+TransactionSerial*
*Else*
       *Description*
*Else*
*IF[DescriptionnotEmptyandAdjustmentOptionnotEmpty]*
*Then*
       *Desription*
*ElseIF[Category==Payment&Source==ACH]*
*Then*
       *Category+Source+FROM+AchCompanyName+AchCompanyEntryDescription+AchName*
*ElseIF[Category==Payment&Source==Check]*
*Then*
       *Category+Source*
*ElseIF[TransferOptionisnotEmpty]*
*Then*
       *Category+TransferOption+FROM+Source+Description+TransferIdCategory+TransferId*
*Else*
      *TerminalCity+MerchantName+TransactionSerial*
**

So Including your Logic it will become like this,


*IF[PostingDateislessthanorequal2020-10-25]*
*Then*
*IF[Category==Payment]*
*Then*
       *Category+FROM+Description+TRANSACTIONSERIAL+TransactionSerial*
*ElseIF[Category==Advance&TransferOptionisnotEmpty]*
*Then*
       *Category+TransferOption+TransferIdCategory+TransferId+Description+TRANSACTIONSERIAL+TransactionSerial*
*Else*
       *Description*
*Else*
*IF[DescriptionnotEmptyandAdjustmentOptionnotEmpty]*
*Then*
       *Desription*
   *ElseIF[Category==Advance&Source==Insurance]*
*Then*       *Source + Description*
   *ElseIF[Category==Payment&Source==ACH origination]*
*Then*       *Category + Description*
*ElseIF[Category==Payment&Source==ACH]*
*Then*
       *Category+Source+FROM+AchCompanyName+AchCompanyEntryDescription+AchName*
*ElseIF[Category==Payment&Source==Check]*
*Then*
       *Category+Source*
*ElseIF[TransferOptionisnotEmpty]*
*Then*
       *Category+TransferOption+FROM+Source+Description+TransferIdCategory+TransferId*
*Else*
      *TerminalCity+MerchantName+TransactionSerial*

comment: From the CU: Hello, I have looked a several statements (and attached screen shots) the external transfer and insurance issue appear to be correct. Bad news, fixing that looks like they broke something else. Cash payments are posting with the transaction serial number as opposed to cash payment or something like that (again please see screen shots attached).

comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] ,

In Member 100438 & 100306, mentioned transactions are...

!image-2021-08-20-02-29-06-744.png!

!image-2021-08-20-02-34-12-616.png!

!image-2021-08-20-02-35-07-665.png!


Mentioned transactions fall into this marked condition,


!image-2021-08-20-02-30-03-315.png!

which will print "*TerminalCity MerchantName TransactionSerial*" but there is no data present for *TerminalCity*and*MerchantName.* That's why it only prints *TransactionSerial*as description in the end.

Thanks,
[~fahad]

comment: Understood. Lets add the following rule for cash payments so we dont break anything else:

<source option ="S"> + <category option>

Cash Payment

Please provide new sample.


author: JIRAUSER10910
comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]

Then the new logic is ...

*If [Category is Payment and Source is Cash ]*

*Then*

  *Source + Category*

Let me know if I'm wrong.
Thanks,
Fahad
