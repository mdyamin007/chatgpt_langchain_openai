I am having permission issue while running isisdisk in rht.

!image-2022-10-20-18-07-40-494.png!

Please update the permission of the folder/t/isd_input/indiv_afp/hrtb/afp-archive/ so that the process can create folder inside it.

Due to this issue i couldn't provide ISD index today to Andrea.

Thanks

We didn't provide 1st sample yet. How come they would approve physical sample? There could be issues that not has been fixed yet in the physical sample.

Please wait for the first sample regarding the DPVS.

Thanks


author: andreav
comment: [~mahbubS] - dpvs can be provided for 2nd set. Physical samples are so the client can review format and color ONLY. Data validation is done with the pdf samples.

comment: Hi [~andreav] [~Peter.Dang],

We will provide sample shortly. It's under review.

But we are facing check image extraction issues that we have got from client.

!image-2022-10-25-20-48-05-051.png!

Due to this check images are not visible in the sample. There will be jus placeholder in place of check images.

[~Peter.Dang]please look into this issue.

We will provide sample using the dataDD7600P20220902231110.XML.

And [~andreav], i attached a dpvs.[^hrtbms1102.print]

It is from rht server. I don't know if it will work for you. But right now this is what i have.

comment: [~mahbubS] - DDA samples set 2 approved. Client has a question, please advise:
_Our compliance area had one question  can you please confirm the logic  - they found an example of an account type  one account had the od box listed with zeros and for the same account type a different account number it did not have the od box.  The box is display flag is coming from the data file correct? InfoIMAGE does not control the presentation, right?_
 !image-2022-11-10-18-30-56-787.png|thumbnail! 
 
Please confirm if the last dpvs is still good to use for client samples and QA samples. If so, please provide the file id and image range. Please include heavies as well. 
Please also provide a sample of an invalid address report.
