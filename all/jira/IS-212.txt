Please upload mockups. QA needs an original customer document so we can compare it with the attached pdf sample.

author: nischala.manjunath
comment: [~barnetts], Can you please help request print samples for QA? I've attached the DPVS  [^ewbbsm130.print].
The file to print is ewbbsm1305.fgn.afp, account sequence - 14235 - 14240.

Thanks!


author: barnetts
comment: Nischala what is the image range for Account sequence of 14,235 - 14,240?
The print request doesn't give me this option. Can you please assist? 


author: nischala.manjunath
comment: Barnett, this has eform so they need account sequence to print instead of image range. However, in this file they are all single page accounts so the image range is the same as the account sequence - 14235 - 14240.
