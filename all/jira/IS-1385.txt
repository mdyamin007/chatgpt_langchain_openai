Sounds like missing - header
See attached - below
 !Missing header  --PAID--.png|thumbnail! 

[~jharvey]
>>> Please confirm - if needed

comment: [~jharvey]
On the files attached to the JIRA - I see "PAID" header

Based on your reply in the BT-149 -
I believe it is ready for the client review

I am a little bit confused here, but want to mention that, the left side is the new format and right side is old.
