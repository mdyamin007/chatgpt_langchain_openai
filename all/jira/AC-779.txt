title: WFCU - [30599][pvt] Standalone Transaction Comment Issue
description: Update following format program to show dates in transaction, if 410 is follow by 439 (instead of follow by 430).
wfcums1(regular stmt), wfcums3 (Business Stmt)
Note: only found this issue on the regular monthly statement. But the business statement is similar to the regular one. So
format program for both applications will be updated.
