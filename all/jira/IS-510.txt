author: JIRAUSER11003
comment: [~Igor.Khosid]there is no heavy for FCBT and none of the applications handle heavy cover page. The control file contains cover_ovl="STMTC1" but STMTC1 overlay has no logo.

author: phoebe.george
comment: [~jasonV] We have FINALLY completed a new print test that the customer has approved. Attached is the new logo. Please update and provide updated DPVS when ready.

New logo name: CTFC_Logo_RGB_02-22.tif

[~Peter.Dang] FYI, as discussed on our call.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~jasonV] Please keep this on HOLD again; a recent DPVS from another programmer showed that the color is still bad on the new TIFF logo.

[~Peter.Dang] FYI


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~jasonV] This is hopefully the last round needed for the color matching for this logo! OPS completed another test that the customer approved. I have attached the PDF from the color print team for the values needed for the logo change. Can you use the value information on the updated specification sheet and provide a new DPVS when ready?
