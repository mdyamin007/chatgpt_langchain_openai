Per client's comment #53 on TS#23875 1/12/2022:

What is the split count or size for each batch?

500mb is fine.

What will be the index filename?

Happy to hear your suggestion. I'm just making this up on the fly but I'd assuming, something like... statementType-index-date

What is the archival email recipient's address?

itadmin@ppcu.org and possibly accounting@ppcu.org. The itadmin email I'm thinking should be the main email, so we can monitor any issues with the import.

This project is holding for a while.

I will remove from developer resource list, if we don't have any action within one week from now.

Developer will not reinitiate project until we setup new timeline.

Please let me or Peter know if we need to restart the project.

Thanks,

Tun

comment: Hi [~dawnl]

Just FYI. I removed from resource schedule. We can just leave as "hold" for this Story.

But we will need new timeline when client wants to resume this project.
Because the developer may busy with other projects.

Please let [~Peter.Dang] or me know when client wants to resume project.
Thanks
Tun

Client approved the sample. See client's comment below.

"Hello and sorry for the ultra-long delay. So I recently received approval from the archival team that the PDFs and Index files will work. What do you need from me to start producing the previous X-# months statement PDF files?"

Please note that the service cancellation for Pacific Postal CU (PPCU) will be effective August 1, 2022.

Please note that PPCU will terminateInfoImage Services effective August 1, 2022. The termination takes place AFTER the July Month end statement cycle, InfoImage will be processing this month end file.

Thanks.

comment: [~lemoy28],

Can we provide the archive forthe last 12-24 months of statement files? See client's comment below.

"Then, how do I go about getting the last 12-24 months of statement files produced? I can have Stephanie work on uploading the files if needed."

Thanks.


author: lemoy28
comment: [~dawnl]

Code is released.

Please check with Neil/DP if there's a reprocessing fee.

They would need to resend the files for those months.
