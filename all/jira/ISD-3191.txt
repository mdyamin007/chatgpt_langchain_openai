comment: DSI looking into this. Client is also looking into it on their side since issue is only residing through their mobile app.

comment: From email chain:

DSI confirmed that their mobile app is still using UIWebview which will be deprecated. NCR needs to render our site with the newer WKWebview for it to work properly.
