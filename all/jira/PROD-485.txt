title: Proxy issue for notifyservice
description: Looks like there was an issue with notifyservice this morning, the proxy was responding with a 504 error - notice the sH in the request - we get this when the backend service does not respond in timely manner. I have checked backend api logs and I don't see any exceptions/errors during these times when the request was made.

Can you please check - below are the logs from proxy server ?

comment: The problem appears to be with the web server. Check the logs, there, and you should find long-running requests.



Note{{sH--}}in your logs
{quote}*s*: the server-side timeout expired while waiting for the server to send or receive data.
{quote}
...so,{{timeout server}}fired, while...
{quote}*H*: the proxy was waiting for complete, valid response HEADERS from the server (HTTP only).
{quote}
The server had not finished (perhaps not even started) returning all the response headers to the proxy, but the connection was established and the request had been sent.

HAProxy returns{{504 Gateway Timeout}}, indicating that the backend did not respond in a timely fashion.

comment: I made similar request and look like it takes a long period of time, for my case it took 37.61 seconds. But at the busy time it could exceeds 1 minute which is configured for *server timeout* in HAProxy. So, if we want to allow the request even if it exceeds 1 minute then we need to increase{{*timeout server*at HAProxy configuration.}}
