The sample is too big to attach in this jira.

The sample of this task is at/z/download/ufcu/ufcums11174.2o1.pdf

[~TunA], please help Bryan to get the sample.

Thanks

comment: HI [~Bryanl] : I copied sample file to your secure share folder. (ufcums11174.2o1.pdf). The file is big. Please review first. If it is good, you can request DP to copy the file to UFCU client_pickup folder.

Hi [~mahbubS]: Next time, DO NOT provide big sample file for small updates. You can provide only estimate 100 pages for samples.

Hi [~rony]: Please remind the team again,DO NOT provide big sample file for small updates. You can provide only estimate 100 pages for samples.

comment: Hi Igor,

Please start QA on this.

Project is in QA folder:/d/iss/qa/UFCU/UFCUMS11.zip

Parallel ID:20220111095318

DPVS attached.[^ufcums1117.print]

Afp file name:/z/afp/ufcu/ufcums11174.2o1.afp

Print range: 1071-1091, 3337-3338, 3729-3730

I think print sample is enough for your QA and don't need archival sample to QA this.

Still if you need archival sample let me know.

Thanks
