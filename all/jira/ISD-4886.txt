comment: Hi [~berezinez],

I've updated the logo on the admin site as well as SSO on stage. Can you help me verify? 
I've attached how the logos should look for the admin page (cfcu_new_admin_logo.PNG) and for SSO (cfcu_new_sso_logo.PNG). 

For sso, there is no need to change anything on the sso test page since the logo should appear the same for all accounts. 

For reference, the new logo should no longer show 'Serving the people of Solano County since 1956'. 

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Shun
