comment: [~dyuen], No problem. I am going to work on it. Thanks


author: JIRAUSER11401
comment: [~dyuen], correction is made .Please let me know when the test file is ready so I can re-run the program. Thanks

 Corrections are made based on client feedback. Please see the update below. Thanks.

Sample:[^gcbkdla2214.2o1.pdf]


author: dyuen
comment: [~Tevis Mak], it looks like the samples have an extra dollar sign for the amounts. Can you correct?

!image-2022-06-23-14-04-22-852.png!

Also it looks like the 4 bullet point from the feedback was missed. GCBK asked if verbiage for letters 29A, 29B and 29C could be changed from:

To:

comment: [~dyuen]
No problem. I'm going to fixed that, but just want to make sure that will the future data contains the dollar sign for all the amount? For the previous one all the amount in the data doesn't have any $ sign, but this one does.


author: JIRAUSER11401
comment: [~dyuen] [~berezinez] 
 The error has fixed and here are the new files.

DVPS:[^gcbkdla221-1.print]
 Index File:[^dla_20220621_2_20220623_1731_gcbk.txt]
 sample:[^gcbkdla2214.2o1_2nd_sample.pdf][^gcbkdla2214.2o1.pdf]

^Please noted that Date format is different for the previous and current datafile. I modified the code to show the date in the way that they want. In future, the client need to keep the date format constant as thecurrent datafile in order to show it properly on the letter, and the amount need to include the '$' sign.^


author: dyuen
comment: [~Tevis Mak], GCBK confirmed that they will remove the dollar sign from the data file.

I also forwarded the sample title with "2nd_sample" since that one looked to have the corrections.

Thanks


author: JIRAUSER11401
comment: Hi [~dyuen],

Can you ask if the client can keep the dollar sign for the future datafile? If not, I need a new data file to re-run it.

Thanks,
Tevis


author: JIRAUSER11401
comment: [~dyuen]

This time the new datafile include the quotation mark "" for all the data field. Can you ask if the client can remove it or they want to keep it? If they want to keep it I will need to recode everything.

Thanks.


author: dyuen
comment: [~Tevis Mak], per our zoom, please hold off on the newest test file we received. I want GCBK to send us a good test file before we reproduce any other samples.

Thanks


author: dyuen
comment: [~Tevis Mak], GCBK submitted an updated test file. The quotation marks are removed and I don't see any $ signs.

author: dyuen
comment: Thanks [~Tevis Mak], updated samples submitted to GCBK. Pending feedback.


author: dyuen
comment: [~Tevis Mak] [~Igor.Khosid], I submitted an IRF for print samples. GCBK requested a couple print samples be sent to them so that they can review, so I figured I would also request a set for Igor. Tevis confirmed it would be the same print range.

At this time, we're still waiting on sample approval. The Jira will updated once I hear back from GCBK.

Also I updated the due date to 7/8 since Jira was scheduled for June 30th live date.

Thanks!


author: dyuen
comment: [~Tevis Mak], did an archive file generate for the latest sample set? If so, can you have it placed in their client pickup TEST folder? GCBK wants to test that it ingests in their system correctly.

Thanks


author: JIRAUSER11401
comment: [~dyuen], The archive file is in "/d/infoftps3/gcbk/client_pickup/test" now.

The B&W logo has been removed now can you request the new print sample again?
 The new print file will be 707728_gcbkdla2214.2o1.afp. The range is the same which is page 1, 13, and 17.

New DVPS:[^gcbkdla221-3.print]

comment: [~dyuen] 
As you know, after the "Pilot / Sample Approved" status, the story should go to QA for the final round of testing.
Why the status update to "Pending Parallel"?

[~Tevis Mak] - you should know by now that you need to provide the story to QA after the "Pilot / Sample approved"
Please provide - the index file.
[~Tevis Mak] - please update the status to "Waiting for QA"

[~berezinez] - FYI

author: dyuen
comment: [~Igor.Khosid], I believe I only updated the Epic, which could have changed the status of the story.

[~berezinez], please complete QA ASAP. Live date is 7/14 and I will be OOO starting tomorrow, so I would like to have this turned over for [~jharvey]to track.

MPT #30603 when you are ready [~berezinez]
