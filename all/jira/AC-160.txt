comment: [~MattL]: In light of resource issues, we just literally had to re-assign this project from Le to Ruman (a new DSi Software Engineer that recently joined us). 

Unfortunately this means we cannot make the original 8/20/2021 sample due date. I'm hoping either Monday or Tuesday we can get some updated samples.





[~rumanb]: As discussed via email, please don't hesitate to raise any questions. Please also confirm sample date if you cannot make it by Monday, August 23, 2021.



[~rony]/[~anwarh]: Please ensure to oversee Ruman on this project.



Thanks!
