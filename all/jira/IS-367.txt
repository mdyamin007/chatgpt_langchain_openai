I already forwarded you the email that will be sent to client scott.kitzman@sunrun.com. Search with *Sunrun Daily Deactivation Notice pdf for Retrieval* for email.



Although the pdf name doesn't match with the description but I already showed it to Stephen.



[~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]just to reconfirm the pdf naming that I gave, is it ok?



Thanks,

Rony
