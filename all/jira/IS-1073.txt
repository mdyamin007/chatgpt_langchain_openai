title: MFCU - Daily Letters - RUSH, Fast Track! Manual update of Rate Sheet and Fee Schedule Updates for letters 22, 44, 71 and 83 for May
description: Due to a CU team member being OOO that is responsible for data and insert transmission for the permanent process (TS26940), we will have to manually add the inserts again for May. 


author: andreav
comment: May inserts attached. Per Client, the rate insert is not the final one so expect a final to be sent soon. Please use the one attached for programming and testing.


author: andreav
comment: I have replaced the insert files with the final versions.

comment: [~Peter.Dang] - This needs to be released for the May 1st data file that comes on a Sunday. Can we have a developer release the code on Saturday night so that it is ready for Sunday morning process? We cannot release the code on Friday because the program will error out due to missing insert files since we had previously  hard coded April inserts.
