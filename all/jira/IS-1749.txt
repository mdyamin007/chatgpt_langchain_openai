title: EWBB - [32690][pvt][in-house] Tax software update to Crawford (inhs)
description: 

Here are the testing result with Crawford:

 

1. With Crawford, the big PDF file doesn't need to be split and a EWBB PDF file with 308MB took ~4 hours to process.  With Redtitan, a big PDF file need to be split to around 40mb-50mb per file and takes ~1 hour to process each small file.

2. EWBB on Crawford takes longer to process because there is a backer image that takes up a lot of size and the LZW compression had to to be turned on.

Would it be possible to get a test file that's for the upcoming tax year?

comment: Hi [~jun],

I will check with the client, but that may be difficult as the files are compiled by FIS and they don't usually have them ready until January.

The client sent at test file via the ftp; can you confirm we received it? Let me know if I need to ask DP to retrieve it.



Thank you,
