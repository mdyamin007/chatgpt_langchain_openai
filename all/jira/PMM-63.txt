title: PDF Input File Guidelines/Spec Sheet
description: Hi Terrence,



Can we summarize general guidelines on our PDF input standards? I would like to enlist Tylers help if permitted by David & Eric to draw out a product sheet for supporting PDF input. Our Sales/AM/AC/IMP can share this with prospects / existing clients if they are giving us PDF input file.



e.g.:
 # PDF content needs to fit with InfoIMAGE margins (see attachment).
 # Recipient address needs within the envelop windows (see same attachment)
 # If PDF have graphics and/or color, it needs InfoIMAGE IS department to analyze and confirm if our PDF reader tool and parse the PDF file.
 # PDF file must have embedded fonts. It cannot be a scanned or raster images of the page.
 # etc etc





..

..

##. Client needs to supply a sample PDF test file to ensure our tool can parse it.







Can you guys please add/modify the requirements? SSCU is a client Guy mentioned in our Tuesday mgmt. meeting to monitor carefully and I would like to get back to SSCU before end of day today. Look like client has been trying to scope this project for several weeks now and I fear we are frustrating them as to how long this is taking.





*ERIC/DAVID/TYLER*: Please advise if my request is ok for Tyler to work on.
