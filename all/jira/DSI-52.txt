Account number sort : Flag = accountSortingByNumber,value true/false

comment: ["D", "S", "T", "L", "O", "B", "A", "U"] corresponds to statement types? D is default, L is loan; the rest are?

For accountSortingByNumber, I assume that it's ascending. Is there a way to have it as DESC?


author: shahadet.hossain
comment: No. Those should be account type. Not statement type. I will double check though. 
For account number sorting currently we have only asc/desc order. I have to check with the developer of these two features for more details. Dipak was on sick leave for the day. So, I would be able to let you know before Monday morning.

comment: Thank you. I have actually confirmed that the sorting is desc, which is what is needed.

comment: Hi Tai,

Currently by account sort is descending order by default. If we need we can make it ascending. By account type sort is ascending by default.

comment: Hi Dipak,

Values at data.accounts\[i].acctNum are Strings. I did a test. 398548 < 1700786007 returns false. parseInt(398548) < parseInt(1700786007) returns true.  I have updated util.js. Please let me know if this function is used somewhere that is dependent on String comparison. I checked and have not found any.

comment: Hi Tai,

The same sorting logic was in another method in utils for acct type sorting. i have changed it and pushed.
