The letter I couldn't find the letter 023 in procedure file or any dfa with EQBKDL023.dfa in server. Do I need to create a new dfa for it?

I didn't see the letter 023 in procedure file or any dfa for that. If this letter needs to be added can you provide the mapping?

the Letter 023 is handled in EQBKDL001.dfa. If the title is "Excessive Activity Notice" and subtitle contains 'Final Notice' then it will be letter 023.
