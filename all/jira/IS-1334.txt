The updated sample is attached here. Due to the size of the data file, we generated this sample using a few accounts from the 05/31 cycle's data. Please refer to the sample's second customer, which contains the desired scenario for this update.

Please proceed with the final testing. Additional info - see TS#29945
The samples already approved I do not think we need the actual print samples - please advise

[~Bryanl]
Next time,  please provide in JIRA all necessary and in TS ticket attachments or at least point to the specific comments on team Support
