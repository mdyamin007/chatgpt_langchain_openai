1 Hr

Turnover: 1/25

Pilot: 1/27

Live: 1/31



-------------------per WFCU------------------------------------

So for this particular PDF file, this is for the Reconciliation page within ebanking. So when members log onto the website they are able to access their eStatements, then there is another tab right next to it for the Reconciliation statements.



So attached are the PDFs are for the Monthly Statement Reconciliation and The Visa Statement Reconciliation templates that need to be updated.

It is scheduled to go live today (01/31).

If the client has difficulties verifying it on their test site, can the client review the two screenshots and approve?

Thanks.
