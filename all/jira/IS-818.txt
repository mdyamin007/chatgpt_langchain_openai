 * eStateementOption have the following options

3.) Remove cid&jid from /home/keep/paperless/paperless.lis file.

4.) Create a new ISD enrollment file and trigger ISD PUI server. This needs to be triggered after send trigger PUI statement processing. Order of the call matters! The following are the specifications:



Filenaming convention:

sfce(jid)_enrollment_MMDDYYYY.txt

e.g.:

sfcems5_enrollment_02252022.txt

Please file in $d_dir/isd_input/I3/process-files/sfce/





File Contents Specifications:

The fields required in this enrollment files are as listed below. Please include the following line as a heading in this file. For CIF Number field, please use the Account Number Value. The Status value specs are list above in step 2.



CIF Number|Account Number|Account Name|Email|Status



e.g.:

CIF Number|Account Number|Account Name|Email|Status

22222|22222|John Doe|jd@yahoo.com|E

54321|54321|Bib Miller|bmiller@gmail.com|W

99999|99999|Rachael Paxton|paxtonr@hotmail.com|P



Full ISD documentation is located in:

[https://confluence.infoimageinc.com/x/YxZ6B]





Trigger Logic:

I believe we can reuse /home/master/I3.socket.pl

Make sure enviroment variable e_paperless is set to y and paperlessFile environment variable is set to the enrollment file name

e.g.:

e_paperless=y

paperlessFile=sfcems5_enrollment_02252022.txt



*5*. If <eStatementOption>and/or <eStatementEmailAddress> tag is missing, do create Print, do create eStatement Archival, and do create PDF archival.

Create a report providing a list of member numbers with<eStatementOption>== "B" andsend email to "fmartinez@sanfranciscofcu.com,[stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com,|mailto:stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]tech4@sanfranciscofcu.com".

The report contain will contain a list of account numbers and should be placed in secure4 ftp server.

Here's the body of the email and the report file naming convention listed below.

*SUBJECT*: SFCE ${Application Name}:Corelation eStatementOptiontag == B

*BODY*:

Dear Valued Customer,

During processing we detected <eStatementOption> == B (E-statement and mail statement) into XML file. A printed statement will go out to your members. Please go to the FTP client_pickup folder to download the following report containing a list of account numberswith this XML tagto research:

sfce${jid}_B_xml_corelation.txt



Thank You,

comment: [~rony]:Scope as changed a bit to whenever processing program does not see <eStatementOption> and/or <eStatementEmailAddress> tag. Report needs to be created and email needs to be sent. Do not create paper (i.e. NON-PRINT), do not create eStatemenet (i.e. non-estmt) but still create a statement for the PDF archival. See #5 in description of work for the specs and email language. I updated due date to be 3/31/2022. Please confirm if this ok.


author: william.kong
comment: Updated specs to specify secure4 (i.e. infoftps4/sfce/client_pickup folder) & fixed report file naming convention to no include pgp since there is no pgp encryption. Just use plain text.

comment: [~rony]:Description of work #5 changed again. Please review updated specs.
