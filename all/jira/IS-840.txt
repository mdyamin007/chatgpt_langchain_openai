We have approval from the client on the color match samples. 

Attached are some additional resources from Wilson; if you can't make the background bars, you can use these.



[^HFCU Orange Bar BW.tif]

[^HFCU Light Gray Bar BW.tif]

[^HFCU Red Bar BW.tif]



Also the RGB values for those gray bars are:



Bars: 241,241,241

Box around the bars: 228,228,228






author: kdishroon
comment: Hi [~lemoy28],

The client would like to ensure on the statement that accounts are displayed in the following order: Checking (suffix 0008), Savings (suffix 0000), Special Shares, then Loans. 

Also, per Wilson: "

Two images are attached. One is whole and the other is cut off due to the printer not being able to print bleeds.

IS needs to have 1/6" clearance on the right and top. They need to move the bird down 1/6" so it's head doesn't get cut off."

comment: Hi [~lemoy28],

The client had some questions regarding the Account Details box:

!image-2022-03-09-15-38-46-929.png|width=677,height=238!


 * Is the box going to be a static size or will it be dynamic and shrink or grow depending on how many accounts are listed?
 * Can we can shorten the amount of space in between each account type?
 ** Possibly make the font a size smaller to allow for more than 5 accounts
 * If we limit to a certain number of accounts (5 or 7), can we add a line that says something like "This may not be a full list of your accounts"?
 * Can we remove the account details box, and if so, how much can the transactions section be moved up?
 * Can you confirm that you are including the backer?



Please call me if you need clarification on any of these questions.



Thank you,

Keri

comment: [~Andrey.Kutsenko] [~Igor.Khosid] ' - I am scheduling a call with the client either today or tomorrow to discuss where they want the masked account number which [~lemoy28] will need mapping for. I will provide an update after the call.

comment: [~Andrey.Kutsenko] [~Igor.Khosid] [~lemoy28]

FYI - Here are the meeting notes; the client will get back to me by eod today on how they want to proceed with these items:
 * Masked account number location  This is needed asap; programming cannot move forward without it.  They want the account number under STATEMENT, it should say Account XXXX and either the last 1 or 2 digits; they will let us know. [~Andrey.Kutsenko] will need to update the mapping to include this.
 ** !image-2022-03-10-14-40-03-977.png!

 * The Account Detail Box is static; the size will remain the same.
 ** Can we can shorten the amount of space in between each account type?  Yes, but it will look cluttered; if we reduce the font size the verbiage will be harder to read.
 ** If we limit to a certain number of accounts, can we add a line that says something like this may not be a full list of your accounts.  We can add a line but the number of accounts needs to be limited to 5.
 * Can we remove the account details box, and if so, how much can the transactions section be moved up?
 ** What is the amount of white space needed around the address box? - Yes, it would be moved up to about here:
 ***  !image-2022-03-10-14-42-15-709.png!


 * The backer will be included on the back of the 1^st^ page as it is today. The look and feel will stay the same, they will confirm if the verbiage needs to be updated, if so, they will provide an updated version, otherwise we are to use the current one we have.

Please check with Jason as actuals mockups need to be updated because the font needs to be provided.

[~Andrey.Kutsenko] - will update the mapping to include account number under the Statement.

 Updated mapping >>> See the link to the latest mapping in the Description section



In section "ACCOUNT ACTIVITY SUMMARY" (Pie Chart)the following mapping is presented:

*Deposits*- calculation of all transaction amounts in the Deposit category without Dividends

COUNT xml->envelope->statement->account->subAccount->share->transaction->grossAmount
 WHERE <category option="D">Deposit</category> AND NOT <source option="V">Dividend</source>


 *Dividends Earned* - calculation of all transaction amounts in the category Deposit for Dividends only

COUNT xml->envelope->statement->account->subAccount->share->transaction->grossAmount
 WHERE <category option="D">Deposit</category> AND <source option="V">Dividend</source>
 

**Withdrawals* -calculation of all transaction amounts in the Withdrawal category without Fees

COUNT xml->envelope->statement->account->subAccount->share->transaction->grossAmount 
 WHERE <category option="W">Withdrawal</category> AND NOT <source option="F">Fee</source>

*Fees Assessed* -calculation of all transaction amounts in the category Withdrawal for Fees only

COUNT xml->envelope->statement->account->subAccount->share->transaction->grossAmount 
 WHERE <category option="W">Withdrawal</category> AND <source option="F">Fee</source>

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
 *another method (less coding once the logic is verified)
 At the same time, Diego suggested using the <withdrawalAmountPeriod> tag - total withdrawals including fees.
 Take this value above and subtract all transactions with the source of fees.
 This will give you the total amount of withdrawals and you will have the accumulation of fees for the account.

comment: [~kdishroon]FYI

Differences between the approved client sample file and the mock-up file:
 1) There is no address for the logo on the mock-up
 2) The account number on the mock-up has a length of 5 characters
 3) There is no 'Your Financial Summary' section on the layout
 4) In 'YTD Tax Summary' section no line with the 'Total IRA dividends'
