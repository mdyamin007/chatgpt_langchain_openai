----------------per Client-----------------------

We've had a change in how the Business LOC loans work and we need to update some text on the "Maturing Business LOC with Balance" (Maturing_Business_LOC_NOTICE#) notice. No variable data is changing it's just static text.



I've attached the update letter template here, but here is some screenshots with the highlighted sections of what's changing.
