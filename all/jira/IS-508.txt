author: tanmay
comment: [~phoebe.george]any update on it?


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~tanmay] Sorry for the my late response - the printed logo STILL has issues with the color matching. When the IS program converts to CMYK, it threw off the color once again when OPS printed. Please keep this on hold for now until we can resolve.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~tanmay] I finally received another color update for this Jira ticket!

OPS matched these colors in the attached PDF - can you input the colors to generate a new DPVS for samples?

comment: [~tanmay] The printed color logo looks good! I shipped samples to the client, and pending final approval before we move forward. THANK YOU!

comment: [~tanmay] The customer has approved the printed version of the newest logo! Please prepare for next steps to move forward with QA/production. 

[~yameelee] [~Peter.Dang] FYI - I have attached the newest logo to all the other CTFC logo Jira stories for the other programmers. I'm still waiting for DPVS's from them though, but customer confirmed that we can move forward for all apps with the approved printed logo since they all share the same. Thanks!

comment: Hi [~tanmay]

Per Phoebe, "please hold off on release for IS-509 from DSI for CTFC. I need it coordinated with 4 other applications, same with IS-508 for CTFC."

Please Zoom message me, once if it ready to release.

Thanks,
