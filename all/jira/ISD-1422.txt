comment: Deployed code/added infotrac configurations/pui configurations to dev/pilot, mortgage can be pulled on infotrac. Still having issues with utcu pilot sso, also confirming which index file should be posted with IS.

comment: tai fixed pilot sso. Can view mortgage stmts both through sso and on infotrac, however site seems to display visa verbiage if the stmt type is not default, needs to be fixed.
