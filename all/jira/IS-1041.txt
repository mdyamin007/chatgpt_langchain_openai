If there are less info for a customer in data, then the output is like below when we print the overdraft box at the bottom of 1st page.

The data file is big. We need to analyze some scenario and for that we need some time.

After that we will provide sample.

Thanks

Sample is attached. Please ignore the check image part as in almost all accounts we did not include it.
