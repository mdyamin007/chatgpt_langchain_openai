I let the customer know the timeline and they responded below. Is it possible to get full samples ASAP?

"The test samples are needed now for a TEST run which we always do every year.

The 12/17 date is for our production files."

Customer responded to the samples below - they are now asking us to update the signature with the uploaded file,Krista Basinger signature.jpg .

"We are auditing the test samples but noticed an issue on the Cover Letter. The signature line was changed this year from Connie Wall to Krista Basinger. I apologize that we didn't highlight that area for you. Can you please change the signature line to Krista Basinger? I have attached a .jpg file with her signature to use. Then you can just provide the revised cover letter to review and approve and we won't need full test samples again."

comment: [~billr]

Attached updated PDF samples. The jpg of the signature have a dark background and it's showing as it is on the sample. Not sure if that's how it should be. Please ask customer to recreate the signature resource if it doesn't look correct.

It does not have subject line or email content.

Can we fix it to have the following:



SUBJECT: TKCU: Escrow Analysis Unmatched Report Availble.

BODY:

Dear Valued Customer,

Yes, that email comes from tkcuys1 -tkcuys1_stmt_process.sh. I have fixed the script to use the correct email script that can send attachments.

comment: [~jun]: Thanks for the update. I updated the description of work as well

comment: Jun,

See customer response to the samples below. Did they provide all the files needed to get the results they are looking for?

We reviewed the test samples provided and the TKCU_EA_PropAddTEST_11222021.pgp file (property address file) was not processed with our statement file. Therefore, property addresses were not included on our "test" Escrow statements. The 3rd file below (TKCY_FICSstmt_LxRef11222021.pgp) is our cross reference file so you can add the property addresses to our escrow statements.

We need to move forward as we are running out of time.

I need to make sure that when we send our PRODUCTION files, the property address file & cross reference file is run correctly when we run production files. We will require production samples (as per our normal process) to ensure everything is correct before escrow statements are mailed. We plan on running our production files on 12/17/21.

comment: Jun,

Customer says they have uploaded corrected files for new full samples:

"We sent corrected files in ASCII text per your last comment. Can you go ahead and send corrected samples so we can make sure the property address/file format issue is corrected now?"

"The test samples look good. Thank you

We will send the production files on 12/17. We will need production samples returned to review and approve."

comment: [~billr] I don't see an ISD story for this, looks like Tun mentioned there is no ISD hours required on TS 24271. Regardless can you create an ISD story for us? Per David, we should have the story created first before we perform any work.

[~jun] Once we have the ISD story, can you put the resource on there?

Bill - please create an ISD story
