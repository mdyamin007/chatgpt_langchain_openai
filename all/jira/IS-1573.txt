Hi [~Natalie.Tom]  Dawn sent me following message by Zoom. Please check with your workload, and work with Dawn for earliest sample date.

"client would like to go live to production for the September statement. Is that possible?"

Having checked my upcoming jobs for this month, it doesn't seem possible to go live earlier. If time permits, then a sample may be provided earlier than the sample date of 10/14, but currently due to the upcoming workload, the timeline can't be moved up.

To clarify:

For all share type accounts, we display the Joint Names at the *share level*(rec 300s that is after rec 400) first and below it, we display the Joint Names at the *account level*(rec 300s after rec 200)?


author: ratnam
comment: Hi [~jira_naru]please display starting Joint Names from share level and then account leveL as shown in below screen shot. If any duplicate name found between 300 records (after rec 200 and after rec 400), please display name once.
