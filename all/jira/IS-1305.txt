comment: Hi [~rukmaniR]-Can we also include 1 more update? CU would like to update the names for 2 letters.The CS023 name has been updated to PMI Auto Term Letter. The CS025 name has been updated to PMI Auto Term Delq Letter. Please confirm and I'll update the SOW and Jira. Thanks!

comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] - We can do it but it's not part of the bounceback. You have to create another JIRA for the update.

Thanks!

comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] - The sample you've attached is the e-notice one not the monthly. Please attach the monthly sample.

Thanks!

comment: [~rukmaniR] [~Igor.Khosid]- Thishas been approved. Please prepare for QA and change status to ready for QA. Please provide...

1. Parallel ID
2. Export projects into QA Folder
3. Provide DPVS for print samples.
4. Provide index file for QA posting.

[~Igor.Khosid] - This update is to enable the bounceback process for the Batch notices. If InfoIMAGE receives a bounceback for an eNotice, we will mail the letter with a cover letter (on the 2nd page). InfoIMAGE will NOT update the delivery preference (they stay on electronic).

Looks good (except that the bounceback page is for statements, and the document is a notice[sigh]). On to review.
