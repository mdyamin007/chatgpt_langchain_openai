Quick question...assign it back to me when you figure it out

Do you need to do anyting at the app level for redmine to "listen" to either a new IP for hostname?



Thanks!

comment: [~kent.chan]: Sorry for the late reply. I have created the permanent solution for sendmail to update /etc/hosts file inside the container each time it restarts. So there is no more manual efforts when it comes to restarting redmine.



To answer your comment above, please open port 80 and port 3306.

comment: [~William.Kong]- Per our conversation, we will activate, create the new DNS server and URL for user access for the cloned Redmine server. Once this is up, we will hand this over to you for updating of the data



[~hesham.hanna] please advise once the server set up is done.



Thanks!

comment: [~premraj.patil]: Can i get port 22 access from the IS Jumpstation to redmine



10.4.20.127 [IS Jumpstatin]to10.4.32.43 [ca-redmine-pr-01.infoimageinc.com]

Also port 80 and 443 as well since Redmine uses http and hopefully https.
