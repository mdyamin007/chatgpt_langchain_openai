is it possible to change the live dates of IS stories? Currently I am busy with SSCU Mortgage, SFCE compromised card letter projects.

comment: [~kericapote]: Per my email Friday 3/18 evening:

Because of the delays with the other project [~tohidulI] is currently working on, he will need more time for SLCU. Currently the live date on all his Jira projects are 4/1/2022. Can the timeline be delayed to 5/18/22 as documented in the IMP report? If so, we will update the story.



Please advise.

comment: [~kericapote]: I forgot to state that [~tohidulI]mentioned he can provide sample date of 3/31/2022. If we are in agreement, please confirm so all the Print Related stories in the EPIC are updated with the new sample date of 3/31 & live date of 5/18. Please confirm.

comment: [~kericapote] Please confirm this is on schedule with IS for index file samples and that the due dates have been updated. There are a few stories that don't look to be in progress yet, so please confirm with IS. Thanks!
