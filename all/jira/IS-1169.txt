Is this also the sample you want sent to the client for approval? Looks like only one letter.


author: rony
comment: Hi [~billr]



So do you normally send the print sample to client?

Anyway, all letter looks the same so although it contains only one letter I think it's enough.



[~rumanb]

Thanks

Thanks, will send to client.


author: billr
comment: [~rumanb]

Client responded to sample:

I have reviewed the file, but have several questions.

1. The file Rik uploaded on 5/31 did not contain the name listed in the sample. Where did that data originate?

2. The Account Number variable in the first paragraph is listing a date (October 1st) instead of the first 4 digits of the account number.

3. The font has changed from the original template. Please adjust the font match our original template.

4. Please adjust the "October 1st" in the third paragraph to match the formatting used for the same date in the second paragraph, with the "st" being in superscript.

Let me know if you need additional clarification on any of these items.

comment: Hi [~billr]

If client want sample from any specific data would you please add this requirement to the description of the jira story.

Here is the updated sample[^clcudl009.pdf] basis on client feedback .
 The data file that I used is*clcu_dn_051722_01.zip.pgp* . Client informed that we should use the same font of original template though I used the same *font 'Times New Roman'* as like as production template[^clcudl009_production.pdf]

Thanks!

comment: Hi [~berezinez] [~Igor.Khosid]

I don't know why the old verbiage is showing. Probably this is the old print afp that you printed. For being sure I just ran the script again.
 Can you please print *page no 1* of*z/daily/clcu/clcudla1174.2o1.afp* again ?
 DPVS :[^clcudla117.print]
 I checked it and its showing this

Ruman - The new set of print samples, displayed again date instead of the account number, the samples attached in Igor's previous comment.


author: barnetts
comment: Hi [~rumanb],

Can you please advise on [~berezinez] / [~Igor.Khosid] comment that the new set of print samples, displayed again date instead of the account number. Maybe we are print from the wrong DPVS? 

Thanks, Barnett 


author: rony
comment: Hi [~barnetts]

I don't know how to advise here. We are seeing correct update on print afp file that Ruman already provided as snapshot. So possibly yes somehow ops is printing from wrong dpvs . Can you raise this things to Will/Ernest/Peter. May be they can help here.



Thanks


author: barnetts
comment: Hi [~rony] / [~Peter.Dang]

I am sending OPS the DPVS provided for samples. 
I think we should try one more time. Are you able to provide/generate a new DPVS to request print samples? What are your thoughts?

Thanks, Barnett
