ML3 already has an internal bouncedback report setup. It shares the same report generator as ML1 and is one report file per dt_job_id. Below are the report files generated in July.

sefc_ml1_undeliverable_174949-C16.01-V22380_1_07242022_050009.txt

sefc_ml3_undeliverable_174949-C16.01-V22380_1_07242022_050013.txt
 sefc_ml1_undeliverable_175126-C01.01-V23120_2_07242022_050009.txt

sefc_ml3_undeliverable_175126-C01.01-V23120_2_07242022_050013.txt



The reports are generated in a way of each combination of job_id and dt_job_id, since ISD end could not distinguish job_id when pulling for the same application (mortgage statement in this case). So two of the four files above is incorrect combination. You will need to search by job_id and dt_job_id when to find the correct report to use.



The above files are already generated in July. Let me know if you can't find it from archival and I'll resend it to you.

On ISD side when the bounceback report is pulled, it doesn't distinguish between jids and generates one report per dt_job_id. The JID (like ml1, ml3, ml5) only change the file names. So when ml5 report is pulled, it also pulls job with ml1 and ml3 dt_job_id since they are all "mortgage" application.



The next report cycle in August is on the 24th, which is tomorrow. I'll check if a report is generated for "176258-C16.01-V23120". If not, you could expect the report name to be "sefc_ml5_undeliverable_dt_job_id_seg#_date_timestamp.txt"

The august bouncedback file is generated:

/d/INPUT/I3/process-files-backup/sefc/202208/sefc_ml1_undeliverable_176258-C16.01-V23120_2_08242022_050009.txt

Is jid ml1 still in use? or it's converted to ml5? I asked because currently ml5 is using the same vid as ml1 before. If that's the case, I'll update the file name to ml5 for report generation.

comment: Internal bounced back report name updated to "ML5", no other change should be needed.
