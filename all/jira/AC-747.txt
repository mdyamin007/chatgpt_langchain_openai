title: FNBK - [29909][pvt][in-house] Update to Tax Cross Reference File Processing
description: Need to update the script - fnbk_spec_handle.pl. Currently, the script prompts the user to enter the filename with path for both the cross reference files. We can either validate the file naming convention after user entry or we can update the script to search for files based on the file name patterns in the directory.
