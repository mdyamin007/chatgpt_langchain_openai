 # Add New partial Payment Comment, 2hr.
 -- Record "B" field 25, the message contains contains hex '0A' control character between
   the 2 message. This is an issue for our format program since hex '0A' is record delimiter
   and will cause record "B" to split.
   Therefore, will need to do preprocessing to fix record "B".
 -- The messages can be split by '*' character or similar means (developer's choice)
  
2. Misc Fees & FCL/Bank fees are 1hr.
 -- TOT_FEES_CHARGE value is currently from record "B" field 11.
   New TOT_FEES_CHARGE = record "B" field 11 + record "I" field 8 + record "I" field 9
  
3. Add a new Billing Rights Statement Message 1hr.
  -- Message should be in a box.
  -- Message should be the footer on the second page, meaning will always be at bottom
   of second page.
