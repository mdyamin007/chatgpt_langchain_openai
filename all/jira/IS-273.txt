Should I send this sample to the client and see if this is what they're looking for or should we wait until the client advises me when they'd like to have this call.

comment: Hi [~MattL],

If we already have samples, I'm thinking we can present it to the client since the sample might help them understand the fact that the PMI notices are still posted under the *Notices* tab, which is all under the *Loan* account type and not the *Checking* account type. 

[~Peter.Dang]/[~thomasY]: Please let us know if you agree or if we should have a call first instead.

comment: I don't know what the issue is but it should be cleared up with the client before we proceed.
