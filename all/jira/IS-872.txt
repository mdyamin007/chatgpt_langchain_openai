comment: [~anwarh]-Please note, per William, we will need to enable AOLP via InfoTrac for the first cycle only so the bank can review an approve the first set of samples. Please let me know if you need anything. I'll let ISD know they need to turn on as well.

comment: [~PramaG] [~anwarh]- Per OPS -The proc id# 704988 is no longer in PRISMA and I was not able to recover them using PuTTY. Youll have to have them put back in or give me a newer PROC id#.

comment: [~anwarh] [~PramaG]- the bank noticed an issue with the printed samples. Per the bank...



The sample page 12 is missing the city. Under Reg E we have to have the transaction whole and not separated.

11/29 ATM must have the city.

Sample File -[^IS-872_WEST_PrintSamples_05312022.pdf]


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~anwarh] [~PramaG]-

We have code that make sure not to separate the Reg E transactions.

FIS sends you the raw data by page, please have your team make sure that they are not separating the page on all statements.

See attached - Should have "Bakersfield" printed underneath. !WEST Savings.PNG!


author: JIRAUSER10909
comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]- The updated PDF sample is attached here. We're now following the data file's page layout. That means the sample will have the same number of lines per page as the data file. As a result, some pages will have whitespace.

Please review the sample. Thanks!

1. Please add the Customer Service number and header "*********************Savings*****************************" to subsequent pages. See attached.

2. All subsequent pages start too high. They need to align where the first page starts.

author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: Hi [~anwarh]- One more update. Please see attached. They want to match with IRA. So...



1. Update Page numbers to left align with Account Statement above it.

2. Align customer service number to left align with the verbiage above it.

author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: Hi [~anwarh]- Bank is also reporting the HOLD statements in the PDF archival are marked as Recycle. Per the bank...



2629516143 address Recycle within Image Centre it Hold Mail but should be Do Not Print.

2254041698 is a true Hold Mail and indicates Hold Mail which is correct.



Diego talked about if the file indicates H but the Address has Recycle then default to Recycle Do Not Print and archive only



Was that logic put into the Saving Statements?


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~anwarh] [~enricob]- Per the bank...2353149707 should be HOLD MAIL


author: anwarh
comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com], 
From the last 3 comments, seems like they are seeing old samples. We've fixed the alignment way back. 
Also, I do see 2353149707 account in sf1 file, which is hold mail. 

Can you please check? 


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~anwarh]- There are only 1 set of samples in your share drive. That is what I'm sending to the client. THere's no way possible I'm sending old samples as they aren't there for me to grab.



The question for the above accounts is the PDF archival file. Not the SF1 file. Please advise ASAP.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: Account2629516143 should be "N" and it is "0" in the index file.

!IRA vs Savings Customer Service Verbiage.PNG!


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~anwarh]- to clarify the above update...



1. Update Page numbers to RIGHT align with Account Statement above it.

2. Align customer service number to RIGHT align with the verbiage BELOW it.


author: anwarh
comment: Fixed, Check again. Thanks


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~anwarh]- Almost there. Can you push the "Page" closer to the "1"? It looks off. Once done, please re-generate Archival and PDF samples.

Please update to how you had it before. This is the top right of the statement. Bank likes it left justified.

The client says Recycled statements are being added to the Hold statements in PDF archival. Recycled logic should take 1st precedence before Hold codes. Please review and provide new archival.

comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com], [~enricob], 

I'm not sure what they are referring to. The only issue I see in one account, recycle statement verbiage is different that what we have in SOW. 

{code:none}
2131203172STW1ST44S01 HLD1          CECELIA ALVAREZ ANGUIANO             131

{code}
We have coded for "RECYCLE" not "RYCYCLE". 

Another instance is what I mentioned before, one account just has one line
{code:none}
0000161555STW1ST44S01 100P                                                                                                                                    
{code}

Other than that did they find anything else? If yes, can I know the account number/name? 

The top header changed and the sample is in my share. 

Thanks,
Anwar

I was looking in the mapping and saw about the Selective inserts. Will this have any impact on script, because in SOW I did not saw any thing about selective insert

comment: Hi [~Najoa]- Yes, but this code will not need to be ready until 12/1 when the bank will have a selective insert for the whole month of December.

I updated the mapping in sharepoint to make it less confusing. The stuffer code/selective insert is in pos 22. I added the test data file to Anwar's folder in ac secure share. Filename: test savings statement file w stuffer code.7z

One more thing the sample was approved without account masking so its not masked.

BT-526 and BT-533 kept as is, as for now there is no estatement

Thanks
