title: SSCU - [26364][pvt] SSCU: Core Conversion Update for Electronic Statements for OLB Psuedo Numbers
description: Set-up external mapping file for processing to handle the pseudo numbers that are being used for business accounts through NCR:



This mapping file will need to be provided by the CU and will tell our system that when we see a particular account number in the SSO request that matches the mapping list, it will translate to and login as another member number in our system.



This is the format of the file that we would request:

Internal Member Number_(Number Stored in InfoIMAGE DB)|_External Account Number_(Number Coming in From NCRs SSO request)_



Example:

123|456

When SSO request comes in with account number 456, the user will log into account 123.



PLEASE NOTE:
 * Multiple external account numbers can point to the same internal account number, but not vice versa. Based on the above example, account 123 will only have one profile no matter how many external account number ties to it. This means email addresses, delivery preference, and users name will be shared. For all the reports we sent back to the CU, it will also only have account 123 and not the external account number the user login as.
 * Account 456 should not exist in our system. Any statement posted to that account will be inaccessible through the member site.
