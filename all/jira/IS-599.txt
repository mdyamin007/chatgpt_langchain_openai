title: EWBB - Black Knight Mortgage Core Setup: Escrow Analysis eStatements
description: Escrow Statement
Program can capture account number, account name and statement date
The quality of AFP output does not look good. We will try export to TIFF output.
We do NOT have a good anchor here.
The verbiage ANNUAL ESCROW ACCOUNT DISCLOSURE STATEMENT being repeated in subsequent pages.

Electronic only; no print/PDF archival

comment: TS#26883: Issue came up with client trying to view PDF on pilot site.

I have fixed an issue with the format step that was causing the individual AFP to have a fatal error. I have reprocessed all related applications (ewbbml4, ewbbml5, ewbbml6) with the changes in staging environment.

Also, changed the naming of the individual afp within the estmt index file: e.g.ewbbml6_01272020_10001155_1887.afp->ewbb_01272020_10001155_1887.afp
