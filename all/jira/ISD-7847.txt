comment: [~Azad] - Can you confirm the index files from print side are loaded for API testing and also posted to InfoTRAC?

I generated the ISD index today.

Below is the ISD index name:

ms1_20220905_1_20221024_0345_hrtb.txt

Thanks

comment: Per Azhar, the DDA is posted and ready for API testing. HRTB can make authorized request to search/all API and get statement data.

comment: [~Azad] - The DDA is not posted on InfoTRAC job status. Please post ASAP for QA prelim review. We are behind on the timeline.

DDA should be processed with DT_JOB_ID to view in InfoTRAC job status. I tried today to process DDA with DT_JOB_ID but the job failed having this issue _"Online Proofing Approval: Job requires Approval but missing DT_JOB_ID"_.

[~mahbubS]from IS side is working on DT_JOB_ID for DDA. I am waiting for his confirmation on this issue.

comment: Hi [~andreav]

DDA index file is successfully processed with DT_JOB_ID on Pilot (job_id:189926). Also, this job is pending approval on InfoTRAC job status. Please see attached [^hrtb_dda_job_status.png].

Let me know if you have any query.

comment: [~Azad] - There should be no AOLP. Please turn off the AOLP feature.

I need some clarification about this one.

Current implementation is following:
 # DDA job is posted to Processing UI and it will wait for internal IM/AC to release.
 # IM/AC will go into InfoTRAC job status and release the job.
 # Admin can now go into InfoTRAC job status and approve the job.

Are you asking to omit the 2nd step (internal release) and the job should go to admin approval step directly?

Or to remove the approval feature altogether?

Let me know your feedback.



[~Tin.Chak]please correct me if I am wrong or I am missing something. If we just omit the internal release step, then Print side should turn on the bypass internal release flag. And if admin approval is not needed then we should update the client configuration and remove the needApproval flags.

Thanks!
