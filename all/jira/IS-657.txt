comment: [~fahad]/[~kericapote]: Why is there another project for this? Were we supposed to go live on 12/10/2021? This project is past due. Please advise if we overlooked this project and missed deadline and impacted production.

comment: Hi [~William.Kong],
The SEFC RMD Notice is already in production. This ticket is regarding SEFCDLC script from which we extracted the RMD. We missed out the extracted part to be removed from the current script. Initially We didn't touch the sefcdlc_process.sh as the rmd is fully separate as it won't get affected if not removed. the current script will only produce an entry on the dpvs with 0 value. I've discussed with [~diegof], then he suggested that we should remove it. So this ticket is for that. We've also discussed on the live date to be set on 20th December.
Thanks.

If you run the program you will see no entry in dpvs for Annual Reminder Letter (045) or RMD notice.
 Thanks
