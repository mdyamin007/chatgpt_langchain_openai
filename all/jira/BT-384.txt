Hi Anil, This is on pilot sucu etax posting. I found that all etax jobs the "posted" accounts are not displaying the SSN, but the "failed" ones are displaying it. Is this expected?

comment: [~eric.yan]we show information based on information in database. Do you know if ssn are stored for those accounts in database.

I check the logic and SUCU doesn't store the SSN when it post successfully. The SSN is only stored when it failed posting (in this case missing account number) for logging purpose.
