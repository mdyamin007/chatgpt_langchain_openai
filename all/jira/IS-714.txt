Yes, I am handing over to QA today for review.

QA

This in-house update to the sanaqs1 application is ready for review. The processing script sanaira_process.sh has been updated to track the FMV file in the .ran file and in the checksum log file.

We should be able to move this to parallel, as client approval and print samples are not needed.
