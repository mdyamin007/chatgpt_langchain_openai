comment: [~rogelio_jira]: Can you retry again? seems like the Stale NFS file handle is fixed itself when I remounted earlier.

comment: [~Peter.Dang]: Can you please have someone review this processing issue. i'm assuming we need to update the control file.


author: peter.dang
comment: eSttmtSelinsFlag is not an error. It is for displaying purpose. Look like isisace2.sh causing the error. Is the database for ace software updated? [~William.Kong]


author: william.kong
comment: [~rogelio_jira]: The ACE /d/zip folder has a NFS Stale handle also.

I've informed Network as we seen several incidents with this same problem:

I unmount and remount this folder. Can you re-test?

comment: Hey William,

According to the error, we are not able to find the PDF file in the cd_pdf folder. Can you have someone confirm if the PDF file were create and copied over? I only see the PDF index but not the PDF. Tiff images seem to be fine.

Thanks

Can DP have an access in windows to Brisbane CD Machine, in case we need to print label and burn the CD manually?

Give us the location / path to access the location thru windows from our PC.



Thanks,

Rogelio

comment: Prem,

Can you help mount the c:\cddirector folder for DP if possible.

BTW, I just tried to RDP to the machine but have issue connecting to it.

Thanks
David

comment: Going to close this ticket. Plan has been changed to use the Menlo cdDirector machines since the new Brisbane cdDirectors are non-functional
