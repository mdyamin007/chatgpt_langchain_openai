title: mailer-instant.infoimageinc.com:  @infoimageinc.com domain not received
description: [~ferhat.doruk]: I tested the mailer-instant.infoimageinc.com within the 10.4.20.### which is the only subnet that is working. I'm not able to receive any emails that goes to william.kong@infoimageinc.com



However, when I sent it to my person yahoo.com email address, i did receive it.



Is there a reason why i will not get emails into @infoimageinc.com?

There was an internal mail routing problem. It should be fixed now.



Thanks,

comment: [~ferhat.doruk]: Per my email just know, i confirmed it works. Howeever, BRIS-166 still has issue.

In the meantime, I will close this BRIS-167. Please look at BRIS-166 when time permits.
