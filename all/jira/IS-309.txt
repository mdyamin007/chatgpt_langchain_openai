comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]: Any objections voiding this ticket? I recently created another Jira ticket that has this update in addition to the recently reported issues?



[IS-329] SPCU: Monthly Statement Post Launch Issues [In-House] - Jira (infoimageinc.com)





Please advise.
