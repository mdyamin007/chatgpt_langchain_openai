title: Unable to verify IMB barcode due to missing DP (delivery point)
description: In postal barcode, 25 or 29 digits are output instead of 31.

The last 2 digits (DP) are always missing. 4 digits before DP for ZIP+4 are not output when ZIP+4 is not available.

Examples:

Member # 1575:
Barcode:0004190114189706668695624
(25 digits, no ZIP+4 in address)

Member # 1630:
Barcode: 00041901141897055314958235106
(29 digits, ZIP+4 in address)

Member # 2628:
Barcode: 0004190114189706668794115
(25 digits, no ZIP+4 in address)

Member # 3130:
Barcode: 00041901141897066688956286711
(29 digits, ZIP+4 in address)

Yes, that is correct. Those accounts do not have a postnet. The postnet contains the the delivery point.

Since we do not have the postnet the print module will use the zip code to generate the IMB.

Per over conversation, I attached some images from 2o1 file. This is only for postnet review. Please ignore backer and other image missing.



Thanks,
