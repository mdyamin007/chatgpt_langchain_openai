description: SURU PDF Archival to the S3 Cloud Fix

Update the documentation composition tool to detect if document has duplicate IID. If that is the case, our program will only generate the first occurrence of the duplicate IID. The duplicate IID will be ignored and skipped. We will also create a report and email a list of all the duplicate IID that is detected.

The email content will be setup as follows:

SUBJECT: SURUMS5: Duplicate IID detected in your PDF Archival Files.

BODY:

Dear Valued Customer,

It contains IID that appears multiple times in the cycle but only one PDF was created in your PDF archival files. The report contains the total occurrences and the IID value.
