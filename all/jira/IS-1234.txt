title: COMM - Stmt - Mortgage PDFi Conversion to AFP2PDF Python [InHse]
description: Update existing processing script to no longer use PDFi tool to create pdf.
 Instead use afp2pdf.py program with index_build_multicore option for ALL statement related apps.
 The smaller daily notice jobs can use the current index_build options.

All the zip file, pgp encryption, index file contents, and PDF file naming convention must remain exactly the same original specifications.

Please ensure the standard SOP on the directory structure must be followed: 
 ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/pdf, ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/zip, ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/work is followed.
 Also, clear the folder directory folder before each processing. We do NOT want to accumulate previous runs.

The current program should support checking total PDF counts verification to make sure the expected pdf matches the total number for pdfs generated; If not, incorporate this standard verification logic

Processing Scripts to modify:
 commml1_process.sh

Data Files to use:
COMM_mortgage_080922_1.zip.pgp



*CUSTOM:*

Please modify processing script for commml1 to+keep+ the zip file in $d_dir/comm/commml1/zip/ folder. Today, the program just keeps the pgp file in the zip folder but does ++notkeep the zip file. We need to save the original PDF archival zip file in the zip folder.



Also, please use the+newer+ data file mentioned above. I'm going to save the production PDF folder so that we can do pdf_compare when you provide revised samples.

Let me know if you need anything for this. Thanks

comment: [~anwarh]: Can you run the following data file in parallel:

COMM_mortgage_070422_1.zip.pgp

I've made a backup copy of the production PDF files and would like to compare the PDF results forCOMM_mortgage_070422_1.zip.pgp in parallel.



Thanks!

comment: [~anwarh]: I lost the production file apparently so I backed up a copy ofCOMM_mortgage_archival_07192022_1.zip.pgp. Can you return this particular cycle in parallel so that we can use to compare.

Sorry for the late response,

Status: Waiting for the production file.

comment: [~anwarh]: Please see updated description of work and the new data file to use. We need to fix the script to save the original zip file in the zip folder.

Please change status back to "QA Request" after you are done. Thanks!

comment: Hi [~William.Kong],
 data file used: COMM_mortgage_080922_1.zip.pgp, (/d/download/comm/mortgage/COMM_mortgage_080922_1.zip.pgp) 
 Parallel server's (rhs) output is kept at: /z/dsi_pdfi_testing/commml1/new/pdf/

This script commml1_process.sh uses archival_process.sh which is responsible for removing the zip files from the directory ($d_dir/pdf_afp/comm/commml1/zip).

Also the issue of keeping zip files in that directory has already discussed and solved for parallel server in the ticket IS-1207. So, this issue will be solved whenever the script (archival_process.sh) will be released in production.

Thanks,
 Rakib.

comment: [~anwarh]: I looked at your folder/z/dsi_pdfi_testing/commml1/new/pdf



How come the individual pdf file name is 08162022 instead of 081022? The PDF compare program will complain that date is different. At least the index file namecommm_mortgage_index_08092022_1.txt matches?



The following is the production pdf file content usingCOMM_mortgage_080922_1.zip.pgp

comment: Hi [~William.Kong] ,

Current date logic for pdf file name is:
DFA looks for '000' field in data file (which is a bar delimited file converted from xml)
if not found, sets the date to system date

But based on xml2bar template file, there is no field 000, so it will always pick system date
That's why you are seeing this issue

Though, for this testing, I can rename these pdfs to match with production's pdf's date-month-year.

Thanks,
Rakib

comment: [~Andrey.Kutsenko]: I created a custom regex to avoid the date in file naming convention for PDF Compare; (Please review commml1.sh inca-isis-pr-04:/d/pdf_compare/ )



I ran PDF compare and no issue. Please resume the other QA steps for this project:
