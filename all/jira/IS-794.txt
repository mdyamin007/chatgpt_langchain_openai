comment: [~phoebe.george] - I've placed the new sample - pfcuea1_600dpi.pdf in your AC Secure Shared/PFCU directory. The file size exceeds 10 MB and I can't attach it here. The new sample uses 600 dpi instead of 300 as I mentioned in my email. Thanks!


author: nischala.manjunath
comment: [~phoebe.george] - I was able to process only a small subset of the pdfs sent today, I'm not sure if it's a redtitan issue or to do with the pdfs' size. Will need to look into it more. 
I've attached the dpvs  [^pfcuea1103.print]. The file to print is pfcuea11034.2o1.afp, image range: 1-21.

comment: [~nischala.manjunath] Thank you so much! PFCU has approved the final PDF samples from the latest test file.

I have requested new print samples. Can you move forward with preparing for QA and/or finishing the items that you need to complete for processing/setup? Let me know how soon you can have this prepared for QA - it will be for print only.

[~berezinez] [~Igor.Khosid] FYI, approval has been received.
 * QA Print samples requested from OPS
 * Attaching approved samples
 * SOW link is found in Description already.
 * PDF setup; no BA or mapping document but anchors are noted in the SOW.

please advise, on the approved samples and output on the right side displays Heloc account number and on the print samples Mortgage account number verbiage, what should be there?

!is it motrgage or heloc..GIF!


author: berezinez
comment: [~nischala.manjunath] [~phoebe.george]

there is no endorsement on the print samples, per SOW should be*A -* *Address Service Requested -* *On Printed Document***


author: nischala.manjunath
comment: [~berezinez] - "Mortgage Account Number" or "Heloc Account Number" depends on the input pdf. We're just converting the pdfs to images and displaying as is.
I will add the endorsement type, reprocess and send you the pdf sample.
Thanks!


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~nischala.manjunath] Are you using this as an indicator - what will happen if I ask PFCU to shift to the right?

[~berezinez] How much does it need to be shifted so that it doesn't show through?


author: nischala.manjunath
comment: [~phoebe.george] - I think [~berezinez] is wondering what the text/verbiage displayed should be - "Mortgage Account Number" vs "Heloc Account Number". I told her is dependent on the data file.
I don't think it shows through the envelope. [~berezinez] - Please confirm.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~nischala.manjunath] Sorry about that, thanks for clarification! Yes, it could be either, as the EA file covers both HELOC and Mortgage accounts. Thanks!


author: nischala.manjunath
comment: [~berezinez] - I've attached a sample containing the endorsement. [^pfcuea1_endorsement.pdf] 
Thanks!


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~berezinez] Please confirm if any other questions and/or if it is possible to finish QA tomorrow for this application - sorry for the rush turnaround? Thanks!

comment: [~berezinez]
