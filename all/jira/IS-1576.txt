I've verified acc#245343 from an Index filefhnb_afp_enotice_06302018_121541_1.txt

it shows the Fort Hood logo on some pages instead of First Heroes... see attached.

[^enotice_posting_with_fort_hood_logo.pdf]

^please fix it [~Tevis Mak] and provide another Index file with more accounts.^

[~kdishroon]- FYI




author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~Tevis Mak] Upon research I noticed the index file contains different letter codes and closing dates. Not sure if this update is just for letter 038, but regardless I provided some values from the index file: 

Account | Letter code | Date
2453439 | 024 | 08112022
3044526 | 037 | 06302018
4064457 | 037 | 06302018
4009494 | 038 | 06302018
7888795 | 038 | 06302018

For estatement posting, we have to be aware of archival periods. For FHNB, it is 25 months. In this case most of the letters are dated in Jun 2018, therefore they will not show on the sites. In general if you could provide index files that have recent statement dates within the last few months of current day, we might be able to minimize time spent on troubleshooting.

I'm wondering where did you get the pdf from? I double checked the output on prisma and I can see all my updates there. Also, on your pdf it's still showing the old stock code on the left bottom corner.

 Here is the screenshot:

comment: Hi [~berezinez] ,

This is NOT to update the pre-print form; we do not have the forms yet, these are the updates you should be looking for:


 * 24: some verbiage change, and update on footer and header for the eNotice overlay
 * 37: update on footer and header for eNotice overly
 * 38: same update as letter 37, both of them generated from the same dfa, FCSBDL037.dfa, with different data file

comment: [~kdishroon] I was out last friday and yesterday so just saw this. Tevis provided me a few resources to update on 9/30 which has been completed, not sure if there is any more resources that need to be uploaded/updated. 

[~Tevis Mak] can you confirm? If no new resources need to be uploaded, then I can close out my ISD story as well.
