title: PLBK - [24575][pvt][in-house] PLBK Monthly Stmt #1.01 - Blank pages 
description: During production, Mailing reported finding blank pages in some mail sets. The attached sample is missing page 4 but prints a blank page with just the counters on the bottom left corner. It jumps from page 3 to 5, since page 4 is blank.



---------------per DSI----------------------------------

But about the pagination (It jumps from page 3 to 5), we counted the blank page also. I couldn't find the actual requirement about pagination in smartsheet.



But if client wishes to update the program to print like, " page 3 -> blank page -> page4 " for such cases then we can update this. I hope client already have noticed this and has no issues regarding this.
