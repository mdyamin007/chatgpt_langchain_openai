UPDATE -If a Bill Payment item processed against the member account through ACH, we want the vendor name to appear first and prior to ACH company identifier. Currently, it is coming over as the following (see attached "image004(1)").



Is it possible to change it to the following order reference below?



COX COMMUNICATION XXXXXXXXXXX BILL PAYMENT

*X represents the ACH company ID position.
