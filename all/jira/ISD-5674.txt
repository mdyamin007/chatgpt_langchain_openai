Ready for pilot. Please test a file to see if it will trigger.

comment: [~mac] [~Tin.Chak] In talking with IS about this auto-trigger test, they need ISD's assistance to set up in pilot for the following:

_Could you check with ISD whether they had the inforeach API notification for our internal parallel FTP scanner._

comment: [~phoebe.george] Not sure what Inforeach API notification they are talking about. Inforeach is not even a product yet.

comment: [~andyp] [~Peter.Dang] - can you review ISD's last comment (from Sean) and confirm what needs to be done to finish this auto-trigger test? We completed it for MVCU and MFCU already and want to have this done for STAR also since it has been pending so long. Thanks!

comment: [~Tin.Chak] IS needs to test auto-trigger API; can this be enabled for STAR DDA? 

File naming convention is = dda/STAR_stmt_YYYYMMDD_01.zip.PGP

[~andyp] [~Peter.Dang] FYI

comment: [~phoebe.george] Auto-trigger to post is controlled on the print side. The only thing we need to do is to configure auto-trigger email notification, but that is independent of IS.

comment: [~Peter.Dang] [~andyp] What is the next step on the IS side? Please communicate with ISD directly, as I'm getting contradicting responses on who needs to make an update to proceed with testing.

I just have a phone call with Sean.

IS needs ISD to enable the this feature in the file scanner in staging to test it in IS parallel environment.

It is setup on both pilot and staging.
