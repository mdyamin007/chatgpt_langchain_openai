comment: [~premraj.patil] and [~kent.chan]: Please note. I explicitly spell out Texas DDS server. The InfoSYNC API on dv/stage & prod do talk to Texas DDS database if there are diverts request. Please remember to include the Texas DDS database port rules.

comment: [~kent.chan]:  Based on your screenshot above, the network database ports are opened.  We will test this once we do the full divert testing later when the inserter equipment arrives in Brisbane. I will close this ticket out.
