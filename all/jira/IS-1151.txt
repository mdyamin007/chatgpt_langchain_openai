description: Programming Hours: 1hr IS (In-house) - 0 hrs ISD

Start Date: 5/25/2022

Live Date: 5/31/2022

Note: updated live date to 5/31 since 5/30 is a holiday.

Description of Work:

Update the"/home/master/gocuvs1_process.sh"to detect bad file naming convention inside the zip file.

Update the following lines of code to add if condition to check if it cannot find pattern case in-sensitive: "SVCD????.G1" inside zip

echo "unzip ${decryptFile} -d ${decryptDir}"
 unzip ${decryptFile} -d ${decryptDir}
 procFile=`find $decryptDir -maxdepth 1 -iname "SVCD????.G1"`
 echo "procFile $procFile"

Error message should state something like: "Error: Program cannot find pattern case insensitive "SVCD????.G1" inside $decryptFile zip file. Program will terminate."

Test file with issue is located in: /d/iss/willK/cid/gocu/ts29396/sv22MAY.zip.pgp

comment: [~jun]: Can start working on this in-house fix? If 5/31 date is too short, then let me know and I can re-adjust to later in June. Thanks!

I cannot put script in parallel because Amir is holding it in parallel.

Script is in my folder:/d/iss/junM/gocu/is-1151/updated_files/gocuvs1_process.sh

diff /d/iss/junM/gocu/is-1151/updated_files/gocuvs1_process.sh /home/master/
71,76c71
< filePattern="SVCD????.G1"
< procFile=`find $decryptDir -maxdepth 1 -iname ${filePattern}`
< if [ ! $procFile ]; then
< echo "Error: Program cannot find pattern case insensitive ${filePattern} inside ${decryptFile} zip file. Program will terminate."
< exit 1
< fi

> procFile=`find $decryptDir -maxdepth 1 -iname "SVCD????.G1"`
