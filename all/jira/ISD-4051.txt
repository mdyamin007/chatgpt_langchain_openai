 * Automated Report Scheduler

For us, we can set up the report scheduler to run and generate the 1 time report. This will help prove that the automation works.

Afterwards, change the scheduled time back from the due date to a specific yearly date.

comment: Setup report on report scheduler to automatically trigger on 3/3. IF successful, then report will be created and it proves the automation works.

Replaced one of the existing reports with same info but just different report ID/Schedule ID. Issue might have been related to the fact that two of these reports initially shared same schedule ID.

comment: Automation did not trigger, had to run the report manually. Report scheduler logs dont show any errors for this report either.
