Revert_to_paper process is added to Pilot environment for BANB. I had processed_banb_revert_to_paper_05202022144412.txt_file and it is posted without any error [jobid: 188160].

Please review and let me know if anything is needed.

[~Tin.Chak]FYI.

Thanks!

The client finished reviewing in Pilot and everything looks good. Please proceed as needed to prepare for the final processing. The client will provide the final file on Friday, June 24th. Do we need this by a specific time on our end?

Revert_to_paper process is added to Staging environment for BANB. I had processed_banb_revert_to_paper_05202022144412.txt_file and it is posted without any error. [jobid: 194014].

Please review with this data file and check the database with this file's data. I am attaching the file to the ticket. Also follow this link to view the process logs.

Or you can create a new file and try running it on Stage.

Let me know if you need anything.

I have discussed with [~Tin.Chak]about this. He notified that we do not need the file on a specific time on that day. The Scanner will pull up the file automatically.

Thanks!

Ok, thanks for confirming. Can you also confirm where we are to place this file for me one more time. We ended up attaching the test file to this ticket but with your comment about the scanner picking up the file automatically, it sounds like I need to have it placed somewhere else to be picked up. Please confirm the exact location so I can ensure i have the proper resources lined up to make this happen.

You can attach the file to the ticket like before.

Also I don't think you need to place the file anywhere. The Scanner will pick up the file from client pickup path/folder.

[~Tin.Chak]Please correct me if I am wrong or anything else should be needed to add in this matter.

Thanks You!

comment: [~Kbittmann] They can just put the file in the root folder.

comment: Hey [~Tin.Chak],

The file that the client sent on Friday, should we post it in Pilot or Production. Should I post it on Pilot?

comment: [~shahadet.hossain] I posted it on prod on Friday already. They should be live.
