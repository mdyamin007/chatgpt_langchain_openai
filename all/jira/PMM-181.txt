title: TeamSupport Ticket #13659 - IDCU
description: On our InfoImage Admin site (and Pilot too) the links to view each statement do not change color when clicked. I know this has been brought up previously but we just got a new request that this behavior be changed. What would it take so that the links change color when they have been clicked? It makes it difficult to view multiple statements because unless you are keeping track, you do not know which ones have been clicked.
