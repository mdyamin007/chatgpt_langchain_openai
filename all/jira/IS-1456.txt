1. Sample attached is for SSCUDL113 notSFCUDL113.
2. Print samples are forSSCUDL113 and has the updates from the mockup pdf.
3. This Jira is for SSCUDL113 updates so the QA checklist is based off the modifications for SSCUDL113.
4. Per the procs file, the SSCUDL111.dfa contains letters 111-114 so the SSCUDL111.dfa was modified.
