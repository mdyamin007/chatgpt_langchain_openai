title: ALCU - [22744][pvt] Update New Excite Logo on loan bills
description: -------------------per Peter----------------------------

I found out the loan program is printing the log directly on. No need to have Wilson make create e-form. It is strange that the program is using e-form and also print the logo as well.

Loan applications:

Consumer Loan Statements (ML1),

LOC Loan Statements (ML2),

Mortgage Loan Statements (ML3) - 6 hours

Daily Notice: 3 hours.



Turnover to IS: 10/4/2021

Sample to client: 10/12/2021

Client approval: 10/14/2021

QA: 10/18/2021

Please see the following request from DSI.



Would you please ask isd to post this in pilot*dla_20210326_1_20211018_0738_alcu.txt*and after that client can review the enotice sample. No need to provide any other resources as this logo was same as alcu monthly update which is already in production.
