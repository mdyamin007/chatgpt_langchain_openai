Hi guys, I forgot to check with ISD if there was any involvement for this Jira when I submitted it. Can someone assign/work on this ASAP? I believe [~eric.yan]already uploaded the index file.

[~Igor.Khosid], FYI.

Thanks

comment: [~eric.yan] Is there any new resources we need to upload? If so can you attach them to this story?

If not, then we might not need to update anything on ISD's end. The index file is already posted onto stage.

comment: Hi [~Shun.Kuwashima]

I assume no since the insert is inline. However, QA was not able to see the enotice posted. Could you help me to confirm if the posting is good?

comment: Thanks [~eric.yan], yeah the file format is fine. The closing date is outside the archival period, so I had to update a few accts manually for them to show on the site.

[~Igor.Khosid] [~berezinez] I replied to your email, please check the following 3 accounts. I updated the closing dates to 12/26/21 instead so that it is within the archival period:

27770
30800
50650

Hi Shun, could you help update the dates for these member numbers? It's a selective insert, so not all members will have the insert.

97550

107860

76130

comment: [~eric.yan] Thanks, I've updated the dates for those accounts on stage.

Could you upload the resource here to the ISD server and check the enotice of "97550" to see if the last page is properly loaded? Thanks.
