comment: [~rukmaniR] - See attached. CU reports bounceback letter is slightly different than what is in the samples. Can you please doublecheck?

comment: [~rukmaniR] [~Igor.Khosid]- Thishas been approved. Please prepare for QA and change status to ready for QA. Please provide...

1. Parallel ID
2. Export projects into QA Folder
3. Provide DPVS for print samples.
4. Provide index file for QA posting.

[~Igor.Khosid]- This update is to enable the bounceback process for the ARM notices. If InfoIMAGE receives a bounceback for an eNotice, we will mail the letter with a cover letter (on the 2nd page). InfoIMAGE will NOT update the delivery preference (they stay on electronic).

I don't want to carp, but thebounceback letter you took as a template was about statements (and does mention statements and eStatements quite a number of times). And we are talking about notices.

Looks good (except that the bounceback page is for statements, and the document is a notice[sigh]). On to review.
