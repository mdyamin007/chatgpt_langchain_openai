comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid],

I've updated the logo on the pilot admin and sso site. I've attached an image of both the old logo and the new logo to the attachments section in this ticket. The new logo should only say 'Equity Bank' without any phrase below it. Please have someone check both *pilot* sites:

SSO: All the prefilled fields can be used, account information does not matter for this update.
Admin site: The logo should be visible immediately upon login.

Note: May need to clear cache/use incognito window if new logo does not appear initially.

Thanks,
Shun

[~jharvey], this is ready for client review on pilot. If the client does not have access to the member site on pilot, I attached screenshots from both the pilot member site (eqbk_new_logo_sso.PNG) as well as the pilot admin site (eqbk_new_logo_admin.PNG).

Client approved samples.

comment: I've moved the logo updates onto stage. 

[~nprimak], client sent us a new logo file to use. Can you help me verify the logo updates on stage SSO and admin site? For SSO, you might have to use this Form URL: https://eqbkstage.infoimageinc.com:9780/ instead of https://eqbkstage.infoimageinc.com/

I updated the logo attachment files in this ticket, the difference from before is that the letters are slightly shorter. 

Thanks,
Shun
