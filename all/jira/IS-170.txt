comment: [~dyuen]: Eric is OOO today. Can you, Tun and Eric discuss this project deadline along with the other IS-149 to see if both these projects can go live today as discussed last Friday.



Thanks!


author: william.kong
comment: [~eric.yan]: Can you advise [~dyuen]when samples can be provided for this project?  Last week while you were OOO, a test file was sent. I haven't seen any hours recorded so I'm assuming this project has not started yet. 



Please advise if samples can be provided earlier than the QA sample date of 07/14/2021.

comment: [~eric.yan], the client would like the account number masked. Can you provide new samples with the account number masked and only showing the last 4 digits?

comment: [~eric.yan]and [~gthillaivel], client approved!

Per ticket #20416, comment 49 "Hi Daphne, yes, the samples are approved..."

The original target live date is 7/20, but this needs to go through parallel. Should I update the due date end of this week or next Monday (7/26) to allow time for parallel?

Lastly, please provide the paperwork for print samples.

Thanks!

comment: [~dyuen] [~eric.yan] Can someone confirm what the enotice code/description should be? Judging by this ticket I'm assuming it's gonna be 008 - RegD Notice, but just wanted to be sure before I add it on our end. 


author: dyuen
comment: [~eric.yan], Yes, this new letter will run parallel and be release with IS-149 at the same time.

[~gthillaivel], I emailed the print sample request to OPS.

[~Shun.Kuwashima], Yes, that is correct. The notice name is RegD Notice, however, the notice code does not match... [~eric.yan]I have notice code 014 in the SOW, but you have the notice code as 008. Please advise.

comment: [~dyuen][~gthillaivel][~Shun.Kuwashima]

My apologies. I changed it to 008 because I noticed the number was not used. 

Please change SOW to 008 from 014.
