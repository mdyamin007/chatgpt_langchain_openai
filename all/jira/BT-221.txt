However,  TXT file is generated with TRAY1_MODE='d' (tray 1 mode indicator - duplex) (see TXT files in the attachment)

I will check to see if this is something that needs to be fixed currently.

Thanks,

Tray modes now properly reflect how the documents are being generated (simplex) for all projects.
