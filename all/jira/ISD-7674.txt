comment: Hi [~Shun.Kuwashima], assigning the story to you since there was no assigned ISD programmer.

Thanks!

comment: Hi [~dyuen] that's fine, ISD assigns new projects every friday hence why it might be unassigned until then. 

Also just to confirm, is this just adding a new letter to the enotice tab? The description mentions "adding new tab" so I'm wondering if that was intended or not. Can we also include the notice name in the description too?

comment: Hi [~Shun.Kuwashima], the eNotice name was added to the description. It will be "Payoff GAP". And the letter will just be added to the eNotice tab. It should follow the same setup as the other daily letters.

Thanks!
