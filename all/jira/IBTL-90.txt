comment: Hey Jason,

This job required paperless list.

ESUP_BY_ACCT is commented out in/home/test/insert/alcudla.ins. Please update insert files and make sure there is paperless list file.

[oper1@rhs alcu]$ grep ESUP_BY_ACCT /home/test/insert/alcudla.ins
#ESUP_BY_ACCT: /z/ftpbu/alcubu/paperless/alcu_enotice_paperless.9-29-2020.txt e



Thanks!

comment: [~jasramos]: Can you re-test?  I had to modify the /home/test/master/Setdb2.pm code because the sid=wodb has changed to sid=dev

comment: [~jasramos]: This looks to be a new issue. staging database was working last week. I need to check in with Jun, our DBA as to why it is not working now. I've reached out to Jun for support and will keep this ticket assigned to me.


author: william.kong
comment: [~jasramos]: I restored the original /home/test/master/Setdb2.pm file after confirming that dev database was down from Jun.  Can you re-test and confirm that it is working now.

comment: [~William.Kong] I reprocessed, and everything looks good. Processed successfully w/ no error. 

Thanks!
