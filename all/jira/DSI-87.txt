comment: Hi Joe,

I have uploaded the updated code in ftp. Please find it under the name DSI87_PUI_PROCESSING_BACKUP_FILE_060819.zip.pgp. You need to add the following line in processing.conf.

{{global.isBackUp = true}}

Let me know if you face any issues.

Thanks

comment: Hi [~rifat.mahmud] and [~Shahadet],

I noticed that when the back up helper is called, the record to create the p_job_email record is not created. This causes emails to not be sent out either manually or automatically.

Can you look into this and see why they are not being inserted into the p_job_email table in the database?
