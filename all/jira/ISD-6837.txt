Testing Procedures
 # Select a client on hypercube that has SSO. The client needs to have enrollment enabled and the sendWelcomeNotification enabled on InfoConfig. SSO into an account that is unenrolled and go through the enrollment process. After enrollment, you should see a notification that a Welcome Notification is being sent. Then, provide me the CID, account number, and the email address tied to that account, so I can confirm if its working on the backend.

Mac, thank you. To create login to DSO I need account number/date of birth and SSC number.

If you have login credentials it will work too, but i need special account, not enrolled previously, as you mention above
