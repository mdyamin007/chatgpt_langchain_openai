title: Create DEMO CID on Hypercube
description: Shahadet,

Per our discussion last Friday, please create a Demo CID on production BB site so that we can use it for testing on the day of migration. Please enable DSO and as much feature as possible for all type of testing including SMS.

Thanks

I am asking the team to create the DEMO CID on Hypercube Prod so that we can use it for testing. Can you have someone to help create the DNS for demo CID.

Temp: bb-demoprod.infoimageinc.com

Permanent: demoprod.infoimageinc.com



Thanks

For Proxy, let put them on 17/18.

For App Server: ca-hypercube-pr-01, 02, 03

Thanks

comment: [~davidt]- since this is testing, you only need internal access?

Is the proxy is up? We are unable to access.

comment: Hello [~davidt],

After adding host entry:

10.4.8.217   bb-demoprod.infoimageinc.com

I was able to access for both of the link ( Temp: bb-demoprod.infoimageinc.com    Permanent: demoprod.infoimageinc.com )

But none of those are accessible without adding host entry. For external should we still need to add the host?



Thanks,

Shahadet

comment: [~davidt] don't we need external DNS or only internal DNS will be sufficient?
