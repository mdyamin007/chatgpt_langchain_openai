Assessment Details (IS):
- Add additional argument "JID" to process fcsb_process.sh and remove logic for "JID" depends on segment number.
- Change to use "JID = dlb" to generate NCOA instead of using "job_no = 2" in (fcsb_process.pl -> ${job_no} == 2)
- Update fcsb_process.sh for not change current naming in "TRANSMISSION FILE NAME: " in DPVS.
Even if we process multiple segment numbers for DLA, the program will still use "DL1" in transmission file name.
But add time-stamp in zip file names for download folder.
