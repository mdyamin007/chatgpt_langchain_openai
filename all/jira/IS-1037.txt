description: IS Assessment
 =============
 Hours for development: 8 IS hours (INHS)
 Turnover Date : 04/18/2022
 Sample to QA Date: 06/23/2022
 Sample Approval Date: 06/27/2022 
 Go live date : 06/30/2022
 
 Assessment Details (IS):
 - Parallel required: (no for additional update below),
 - *** make sure test with Jason Ramos for update
 - backup logs and processing files to sub folder. So next process won't overwrite and able to review error and research.
 1. Create separate corresponding working directory (/d_dir/daily/fffc/DD_Seg#/)
 2. Backup all processing files from /d_dir/daily/fffc/ to /d_dir/daily/fffc/DD_Seg#/ at the end of the process.

 - Applicaton = fffcdla
 - Data files Received as:
 FFFC_dn_MMDDYY_1.zip.gpg
 FFFC_dn_MMDDYY_2.zip.gpg
 FFFC_dn_MMDDYY_3.zip.gpg



Additional enhancement:
 - During testing this enhancement, there is 1 layer we are requesting isn't being updated at the moment. Can we please get this part updated:

In Comment #7 FFFC_MbrAcctXref_MMDDYYYY.txt.gpg is backup in /d/download/ folder. I don't think we need to store in /home/keep/ again

Request:
 - Please look for the Xref file in download for processes not seg 1. We are manually having to move the file to the bu folder after each process.

comment: [~Natalie.Tom] [~TunA] [~Bryanl], Jason updated the ticket yesterday. I reassigned the ticket to Natalie/Bryan, not sure if anyone saw it...

"Hi Daphne and Natalie,



I tested the process of seg 1 & 3, and everything looks good.



When processing seg 3, FFFC_MbrAcctXref_MMDDYYYY.txt.gpg is NOT being searched for in the bu folder and does not need to be copied back to bu for processing.

Back up directories available and logs saved.



Everything Looks good.



Thanks!

Jason"

comment: Hi [~dyuen]I talked to [~TunA]and since Jason said everything looks good, I will be releasing the code by the end of the day.
