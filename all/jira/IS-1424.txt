Agfc is sending data file with agtx naming, which we already worked on ts [https://app.na3.teamsupport.com/?TicketNumber=28259]but didn't turned over to qa and issue happened in production that agfc is not appearing in infotrac jobs status. No Jira was created and I didn't turnover to qa that time.

Anyway, I ran in parallel, please post the index file to stage , check infotrac job status tab . Dt job id:133837-C08.01-V22361
