description: Send an email to Phoebe to see what the process is that they go through when setting up a customer on color message manager. Do we use the SOW questionnaires? Any information around how we take the client from addendum/contract signing to end product.

comment: Per Phoebe:

Our team actually has not setup any existing customers on Message Manager, only one new customer, which is WECU that is live with this.



If the existing customer is moving from a text-based message to a color graphic message, then we would need to go through training on InfoTrac, but we would only need to confirm that they would like to keep the same allocated message area as their existing message.



If the existing customer is moving from a b/w graphic message to a color graphic message, we would have the same question, which is if they would like to use the same message area as the existing message.



From the InfoIMAGE side, the IM team would need to provide the specifications for the color message that will be uploaded through message manager, which would be relayed to the customer for testing.
