title: RHS:  Centralizing ALL /home/{$USER} accounts to RHSTORE file structure
description: Currently each RHS, RHS2, RH2, preprocessing02, preprocessing03 servers has is local /home/${USER} store.



I want to change the infrastructure to centralize all user accounts with the exception of users under "opers" group (e.g. oper1, oper2, neil, rogelio, ...) under the future RHSTORE:/home/ directory.




For sure we have decided to centralize the following directories:


{noformat}
/home/isd
/home/control
/home/insert
/home/isis
/home/keep
/home/master
/home/procs
/home/table
/home/test
/home/util{noformat}




I'm proposing to go an extra step forward for account like the following:


{noformat}
/home/ernest
/home/williamK
/home/terrence
/home/peter
etc etc..
{noformat}

comment: Per discussing with Terrence and Peter, it is agreed that they are to also centralize the storage of the /home/$USERS account in the rhstore server.

comment: Unfortunately, we cannot centralize the /home/$USERS on the ca-isis-pr-01, ca-isis-pr-02, and ca-isis-pr-03 servers. This is solely due to the PGP key.



The version of the PGP utility on the clonedca-isis-pr-01, ca-isis-pr-02, and ca-isis-pr-03 servers is not compatible with the centralized ca-rhstore-pr-01:/home directory.
