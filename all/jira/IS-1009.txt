Just checking, did you forward the samples to the client?



Thanks


author: dyuen
comment: [~rony], no. Samples need to go to onshore QA before they go to client.

[~Igor.Khosid], FYI.

Thanks

I am really sorry , looks like I replaced the correct name to wrong name. Would you please provide the update sample to client again? My apology for this.

/d/infoftps3/Vend_DSI/client_pickup/print_process/RWCU/dlc/RWCU_NOTICES_DLC_Archival_04192022_1.zip.001

The sample name is same as previous but it's updated.



Thanks
