Thanks,

comment: [~Ethan.Yu] [~Tin.Chak] Can you provide an update on the pilot date, we need to provide some milestone dates to the customer this week.

comment: Hi [~Ricky Lopez], [~phoebe.george],

Auth Docs will be provided on 5/13.

Pilot date will be ready 5/16 for client testing.

I will be out 5/17-5/20. So if there are issues with connectivity, we will need someone else on support. I will be back 5/23 if there are still issues. [~Tin.Chak]



Thank you

 * {color:#505f79}_Will there be any changes to the batch files for eStatements including enrollment status?

comment: [~phoebe.george] [~Ricky Lopez] I'm not seeing any enrollment file being processed. I only see an ECL file which only have the account number and email address.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~Tin.Chak] We confirmed that customer is only sending ECL file, no further updates needed for the list of questions.

[~Ethan.Yu] Please confirm that you can still provide the API Auth docs today.

Hi Phoebe, I've attached the API Auth doc to this ticket.


author: JIRAUSER11400
comment: [~Tin.Chak]Are the SPECs on Auth Doc correct, need to confirm, as the name was not updated for Red Wood. Auth DOC is showing SELCO as the client.


author: 5ba31365b1a4b82e99864b79
comment: [~Ricky Lopez] [~Tin.Chak]

Thanks for double checking Ricky. It looks like I renamed the files wrong. I've re-uploaded the correct Auth Doc.

Per Client:

 Looks like the shared Basic Key and IV are incorrect. Can you double check on your end please?

I haven't set up RWCU on pilot yet. Will work on in the following days.

author: JIRAUSER11400
comment: [~Ethan.Yu] [~Tin.Chak]-Good morning, I was needed to find out about ETA

I'll have it ready on pilot tomorrow noon time.

comment: Hi [~Ricky Lopez],

Can we have the client test with account number:

0000010017



It looks like the account they were testing did not have any documents. If they're still running into a problem let's set up a call.


author: JIRAUSER11400
comment: I have sent over to them, I will get back to you. Thanks


author: JIRAUSER11400
comment: [~Ethan.Yu]-They are still having error. I will setup a call.

comment: Hey [~Ricky Lopez],

When's their expected live date?


author: JIRAUSER11400
comment: Hi [~Ethan.Yu] Does the production release date of 09/09 work, do you need anything else for us to complete? We are trying to get pilot site approval by 8/29 from RWCU.

Does the release date have to be done on the Wed. prior to 9/9 (or even the Thurs)?



author: 5ba31365b1a4b82e99864b79
comment: [~Ricky Lopez], that date works. 9/9

Can we ask RWCU/Lumin to provide IP addresses that the requests will be coming in from? That way we can whitelist it for them.


author: JIRAUSER11400
comment: [~Ethan.Yu]  For Production environment, here are the IPs that need to be whitelisted -
	104.171.198.98
	104.171.198.99

We are targeting to get final approval on the pilot site by 10/28 in order to move forward with code release on 11/9, is that doable?

What's the status on their production connection?
