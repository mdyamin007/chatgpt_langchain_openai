title: Update ALL Programs To Use New IP Address
description: 

Refer to the following smartsheet:



[https://app.smartsheet.com/sheets/V9xwHXJPFF9m375vQ6QcH4H953WMRvh7RJ3R6J31|https://app.smartsheet.com/sheets/V9xwHXJPFF9m375vQ6QcH4H953WMRvh7RJ3R6J31?view=grid]

Refer to column "Server Name" for all of the a-record names. The domain will be infoimageinc.com



e.g.:

ca-isis-pr-01.infoimageinc.com

ca-oracle-pr-01.infoimageinc.com

etc...



Network will be assigning the Brisbane IP addresses to these URL names.

On the current Menlo Park servers, I will be updating each /etc/hosts file to overload the dns name to use current menlo park IP address. This is so that we can release the code before we move and still make it backwards compatible by the time we move into Brisbane.
