description: Review Code all the code that has hardcoded IP addresses:



+*Here is the command to grep all the code with hardcoded IP address:*+

grep -E "([0-9]\{1,3}[\.])\{3}[0-9]\{1,3}" /home/test/master/*



+*Objective:*+



Create plan with addressing these requirements:
 * Delete all the lines of code that are commented out using IP addresses.
 * Review hard-coded IP address and determine the correct logical name instead of using a different numeric IP address.
