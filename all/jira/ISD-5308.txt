Checked password, seems fine. Possible VPN issue in regards to accessing the check image URL.

Seemingly the VPN was down on the client's end. Networks confirmed our side was up, and client also provided some router specs showing that theirs was down. Networks coordinated with the client to bring up the VPN on client's end, and shortly after I was able to pull checks from the admin site.
