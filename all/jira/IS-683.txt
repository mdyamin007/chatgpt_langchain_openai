comment: [~eric.yan] I checked our afp2web servers again and I can see S1SANABB.300 is uploaded on all servers. I also don't see the backer on either InfoTRAC nor the member site. Can you confirm if the resource file is correct or if I'm missing any others?


author: eric.yan
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima]

On a second look, the resource is only for print. ISD should have a separated discolsure to load for the enotice. Could you confirm?


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~eric.yan] Actually yeah, there is a disclosure tab that I updated on the member site itself, so maybe it is expected that the disclosure does not show up within the statement. [~barnetts] can you confirm if we should be expecting the disclosure to show up both on the member site and within the  statements?


author: barnetts
comment: Hi [~eric.yan]/ [~Shun.Kuwashima],

The updated backer should should up in the disclosure tab.
