title: PFCU - [27577][pvt] Suppress restricted statements from the HELOC and Mortgage Proofing files
description: Programming hours: 4 hr

Sample Date: 3/25

Sample Approval: 3/29

QA: 3/30

Parallel: 4/1

Implement the logic to suppress restricted statements from the HELOC and Mortgage Proofing files;

----This the logic for stmt we implemented for stmt from ticket 24435 ( which I have related here)

Use thepfcu_cif_stmt_MMDDYYYY.txt.pgp file that gets placed into the ftpbu/pfcubu/stmt/ folder.

Go to the column 8 and look for value == 1 (Value-0 = non-restricted and value-1 = restricted)



21|JOHN BEMENT|JOHN BEMENT|14857928|00|JOHN||BEMENT|1|Savings



If value is set to 1, donotinclude this file in the prf file. (i.e. proof file)

This is so that when CU reviews the small proof file, it does not contain restricted accounts in the prf pdf.



Note from client (3/16):That logic sounds right, the only caveat is that I believe that the cif file name and location is different for each application.

This is exactly the same as is-894.

The update is to not display customers with emp code 1 in the job status proof sample. Check [https://app.na3.teamsupport.com/?TicketNumber=27588]comment 17.



parallel id:20220317122202

2 projects PFCUML11(heloc) and PFCUML21(mortgage)

Coding logic is same as previous,I am adding the value "n" in field381 of paper txt if emp code appears 1.

After that I am building the proof file from where the prf sample get generated with only those entries that doesn't have this n in 381 no column and the final proof sample will not include account that has emp code 1 ( "n" is paper txt ).



attached are c1bmcok files ( which is paper txt file that contains all accounts ) for heloc(ml1) [^pfcuml1115.c1bmcok]and mortgage(ml2)[^pfcuml2120.c1bmcok]

and you can some entries in those files with value *n* in column 381 , like pfcuml1115.c1bmcok line no 9.

!image-2022-03-23-16-23-49-570.png!

so I put this *n* from dfa for those accounts those have emp code 1.



Now check the proof txt file from which proof sample gets generated and which includes all entires from c1bmcok file except the ones with *n*.

[^pfcuml1115.prf.temp][^pfcuml2120.prf.temp]

hence in those prf txt file I excluded the accounts with emp value 1 and the proof sample actually get generated from these files so proof sample will not have accounts with emp code 1.

You can check the proof sample here for heloc if you want in stage.

Verified for the value is set to 1, and it's not included in the file prf file
Verified the Coding logic -adding the value "n" in field 381 of paper txt if emp code appears 1.
 Verified the e c1bmcok files ( which is paper txt file that contains all accounts ) for heloc(ml1) pfcuml1115.c1bmcokand mortgage(ml2)pfcuml2120.c1bmcok
Verified the job and pdf generated in inforac stage
