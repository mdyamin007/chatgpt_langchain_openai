title: FCBT - Print/Post 'Corrected' Documents 15415
description: FCBT is requesting a feature/service to be able to send data files with 'Corrected' documents.

If received, they would like us to print and mail as normal, but for posting, replace the previously posted account, similar to what we do for posting corrected eTax forms.



I had a preliminary review with Joe, and this is how we currently have eTaxes setup noted below.

If this can be done, could it be offered as a service, although only FCBT has requested this specific to their applications/setups.



FEEDBACK:

In our current process for posting corrected forms for taxes, we use the following criteria to identify replacement:

Tax form type

Account number

Tax year

FCBT RESPONSE: We could do the same using Form Type, Account Number, Cycle Date.



There are scenarios where one account number has more than one tax form for a same year; when this is detected, we do not replace the corrected tax form (as this is done programmatically, and we cannot determine which form should be replaced).

FCBT RESPONSE: No issue, there should only ever be one document linked to theses keys.



In order to identify using an indicator in the file, we would definitely need to review feasibility and there would be development involved, to discuss scenarios like the one I noted above.

Understood and this would only apply to the following applications:

- LIQ Simple Bills (currently live)

- LIQ Simple Statements (currently live)

- LIQ Complex Bills (live Nov 2020)

- LIQ Complex Statements (live Nov 2020)



Also, would these corrected bills require both replacement for posted version electronically as well as needed to be re-mailed?

FCBT RESPONSE: Yes, both



Please confirm possible feasibility.

Assigning to Joe first, but please assign accordingly if this needs to go through Tyler's team.



Thanks,

Phoebe
