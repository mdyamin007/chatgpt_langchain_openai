Sorry, we didn't pay much attention to this one due to other tasks. When there will be a turnover meeting for this one? Or we did it already , I completely forgot.



Thanks

Do we have data file for this?



Hi [~andreav]I am not sure what happened here? Almost over a month this task left untouched. I don't know where is the data file. I don't see smartsheet created where we normally asked questions.



But anyway, normally we don't put logos for taxes. Is it special requirement for hrtb? Do you know if there are other client who is doing this? It will help us .



Thanks

Sorry for late response. Would you please place the data files in ac-secure-share folder. I don't know why we can't the data files from jira.

/d/ac-secure-share/ba/enrico/is-1668 has a sample for 7 forms.

Although this Jira was assigned to us a while ago, due to workload we couldn't start the work earlier. We developed the same in rush manner, So if you please review the sample first and let us know your feedback would be helpful

We will provide the rest of the samples asap.

Thanks

comment: Got it. Can you make the font bigger, like 11 pt? Their current sample font looks a lot bigger than what we're using. I attached an example here.
