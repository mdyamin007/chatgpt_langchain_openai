comment: Hi [~jira_naru]


 # Please confirm any print suppression in current application?
 # Is there a *Index filename in PDF Archival*? I only see the index contents below. Also, the contents are separated by pipe in specifications but comma in example. Please confirm the delimiter.
 # Also, please confirm what is the field used to populate data forSTMT_DATE andMEMBER_CLASS. Is theMEMBER_CLASS hardcoded or generated from data? IsSTMT_DATE system date or statement start date?



Thanks

Thanks

comment: [~ratnam]:

Sorry, the delimiter for the archival index should be ',' not '|':

FILENAME,ACCOUNT_NUMBER,ACCOUNT_NAME,STMT_DATE,STMT_START,STMT_END,ACCOUNT_TYPE ,FILE_TYPE

_Example:_ _sacums21308_fileCc15Wg.384.pdf,180637,KALEB H WIMBERLY,04302022,04012022,04302022,1,PDF_

For the suppression logic, if both item a) and b) are true suppressed from print and mail; create archival; but how about e-statement?


author: ratnam
comment: [~jira_naru] we are doing eStatements for this SACU applications.



Also, I corrected index file contents to include delimiter "," in pdf archival. Please review updated specs.



Thanks

Sorry, this application does not have estmt.

Also, going back to the suppression logic, item a), where it states:

field 01 is {color:#172b4d}*not populated*{color} in account data, is that the same as saying does not exist.

The reason I am asking is because there are a lot of accounts where rec 200 field 01 does not exist so we will be suppressing a lot of accounts.


author: ratnam
comment: Hi Nar, please review updated print suppression logic below in SOW.


h3. 1. If record 200, field 01 exists within account data and value is {color:#FF0000}not 0 or 2{color}, OR if record 200, field 01 does not exists in account data altogether.

2. If record 200, field 23 field value is 1.



Thanks

comment: [Nar Uk|https://jira.infoimageinc.com/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=jira_naru] [~kericapote] Print suppression logic has been updated in SOW based on logic update recieved from the CU via ticket#32860

a) If record 200, field 01 field exists within account data and value is either 1, 2, or 99 then suppress from print and mail. In this case, do not look for Record 200 Field 23. Include these statements in PDF Archival.

b) Record 200 field 01 does not exists and Record 200 field 23 value is 0 or 2 then print and mail. Include these statements in PDF Archival.

*+*Important Note:*+Per confirmation received from the CU, If Record 200 field 23+do not+exists within account data, then consider the field having a value of 0 and proceed with print and mail.

c) If Record 200 field 01 does not exists and the Record 200 field 23 value is 1. It is an e-statement. Suppress from print and mail. Include these statements in PDF Archival.



Thanks
