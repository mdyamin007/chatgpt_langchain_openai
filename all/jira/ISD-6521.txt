comment: [~Tin.Chak] Sorry, the ISD Story did not create for this! Let me know if possible to still move forward for EOM, or if we have to target a new live date.

comment: [~phoebe.george] There's not enough time to move forward for EOM. This week is fully booked. We can do pilot on 3/3 and Live by 3/9.

comment: [~Tin.Chak] CAMB has been sending the Revert to Paper file to production in preparation for the testing and production release. They want to ensure that the file is good as well, and we can use for testing. 

Here is an example of the file, but it is arriving daily at this time as well:
|CIF/20220227190142_ivbk_revert_to_paper.dat.PGP|
|CIF/20220227190147_camb_revert_to_paper.dat.PGP|

comment: [~mac] [~Tin.Chak] Can you provide an update on this? I believe new pilot/sample date was scheduled for 3/3/22 based on the ticket updates. I'll update the Jira ticket with the new dates as well, but please confirm status. Thank you!

Hi Phoebe, so the client have been sending the Revert to Paper files on production. For example from your comment,*20220227190142_ivbk_revert_to_paper.dat.PGP*and*20220227190147_camb_revert_to_paper.dat.PGP*. These files don't get processed because the file name specs don't follow ours. By following these specs:*ivbk_revert_to_paper_YYYYMMDDHHMMSS**.dat.PGP*or*camb**_revert_to_paper_YYYYMMDDHHMMSS**.dat.PGP,* they were successfully processed.**



However, from the comments providedonticket#26226, they are asking for these file specs:*ivbk_revert_to_paper_YYYYMMDD_HHMM.txt.pgp, camb_revert_to_paper_YYYYMMDD_HHMM.txt.pgp.*These specs work as I created a test file from the sample index files they provided in the ticket.



Also, from processing these files, in the file, they have several accounts specific with type*SAV* which I'm assuming is a Savings account. It should be *SV* instead of *SAV*.

comment: [~mac] I talked with CAMB last week, and asked them to re-name the files in production to the correct naming convention; I also updated #26226 for the customer with the same info for reference.

Separately, please update our account type to read in the 'SAV' found in the file - this is how their core displays this product type, and it used this way in other applications. Please confirm if this is possible to update on our end.



Thanks,

Phoebe

Hello Phoebe,

Thanks for the update. Yes, we can make the update on our end to read in 'SAV' from the file.


author: JIRAUSER10913
comment: [~phoebe.george]

Do we have a new live date for this as well?


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~mac] CAMB has sent the new files with the new file name:
|CIF/camb_revert_to_paper_20220317190421.dat.pgp|
|CIF/ivbk_revert_to_paper_20220317190419.dat.pgp|

Can you review and confirm if good to use for final testing and for production?



Thanks,

Phoebe

comment: I've also updated the live date to 3/25 - let me know if this is doable based on the new file. Thanks!

Yes, those files sent from production are good, and the live date for 3/25 is doable, thanks Phoebe!
