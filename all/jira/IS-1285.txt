we don't have data for letter 056. That's why the sample for it is not available right now.
so we need data file to provide sample for letter 056

let me know if anything wrong with the available samples

thanks

The request is to update the below letters. Letters 49 and 50 are to be removed from the SOW.The samples for notices17, 18, 28, 29, and 30 are approved. We are missing samples for notices 001. They also stated they sent a test file which should contain notice 56. The client provided test file[WTCU_DL_062322_Sample.txt|https://app.na3.teamsupport.com/dc/1/attachments/15007010]

Client states this test file should contain info for notice 001 and 056.The sample file sent has data for letter 056. It's the last record on the sample file that starts withSCRA.HELOC.LTR

017
018
028
029
030
001

Client sent another update today.

I figured it might be easier if I send you a new sample file with notices 001 & 056 on it. So I attached that below.

I verified that the record on the sample file for Chris Vigil is in fact notice 001 & the last record on the new sample file is for notice 056.

File attached in TS 26853 comment 79.
