comment: Hi [~zhuoxinT]

There are a couple of questions followed after our kick-off meeting with client:
 # Please check the Date position on provided samples (3 pdf files attached) if it can keep current place above the Recipients Address or, if not due to envelope window, please advise possible new position on the page?
 # Is it possible to keep the Letter format as close as possible to the updated samples which client is going to provide (closer to[^vwcudla116.is.pdf] format) in order for the CU to keep the consistency with their own system data?
 # Can the sample date be moved to an earlier date? Currently the coding end date is targeted to 9/19. The client asks for the faster process since it's a simple pdf format and we are pretty much printing as is aside from the top portion.

Thank you,
Juliana

For the data file issue,

I double checked on the test file/d/ftpbu/vwcubu/test/VWCU-FraudLetters-20220718.7z which is good. I will use that to start the project.

Please let client know that keep the data and addresses line position consistent in the future.
 So we will not have the issue to capture all the required fields.

This screenshot shows that the address line is slightly shifted down when checking on different account.

comment: [~zhuoxinT] - The client wants to keep the format as close as possible to what they are imaging on their end. Therefore, they would like to make the modifications on their end for the logo and address. Please provide the exact position for the logo and return address to show through the return address window on our #10 house envelope. Please also provide the exact position, font and font size for the address block to show through the address window on our #10 house envelope. Lastly, if the body needs to move down, please provide the position for that too. Please provide ASAP as the client is standing by to make the changes quickly. 

[~TunA] - The client is asking if they make these changes so that the file is as print ready as possible, can we move up the sample date? They don't understand why the coding tine is taking 30 days as they were under the impression this would be a very quick set up.

comment: [~andreav]: The client might think it is easy setup because they send us PDF files. But as you know, we cannot print as is for PDF files. We need many add-on features to print correctly. For example, extract information from PDF, account and page for DPVS, data file checksum and other standard processing features, replace mailing address for envelope windows/OMR/Postnet , daily automation, etc. Otherwise, you can just request OPS to print as is, we don't even need IS, Plus, Zhuoxin is not working only this project. We don't want to rush setup and get more issues later.

I already told Zhuoxin to review the questionnaire from[~Juliana Vannik]and get all the information first, then provide earlier sample date, if he can.



[~zhuoxinT]: Please let Juliana knows if you can provide earlier sample date. Let me or Peter knows if we need to discuss first.

comment: [~TunA] - Thanks for the explanation Tun, we'll relay this to the client to set the correct expectation.  I don't know who told them it would be a simple set up. Anyway, the client wants all the info to do the formatting on their end to save us time and to match imaging on their end so we need the logo and return address position, the address block font, font size and position to relay to the client ASAP.


author: JIRAUSER11101
comment: [~Juliana Vannik] [~andreav] ,
 the logo size is 2.750 width and 0.853 height. I cannot tell you font size or type in logo because it is embedded in the image. We position the logo 1 inch horizontally and 0.3 inch vertically. As far as the envelope window specs, you will need to get that from OPS.
Also, if they are concerned about time, Im almost certain it would be much faster they provide us the logo and we go from there.

I would rather they keep it exactly the same as what they sent us in data file:/d/ftpbu/vwcubu/test/VWCU-FraudLetters-20220718.7z

These research for position and correct font are taking more times for us.
Even they formatted on their end, that would not help a lot.

comment: [~zhuoxinT]

Thank you, we will pass this to the client. Also could you please provide the requirements of standards for the address block size/font please? That would help them process the samples as close to our requirements as possible.

Thank you,
Juliana

For mailing address, Horizontal: 1.5inch, vertical: 2inch. font : Ariel, size: 8pt.

As I mentioned above, I would rather they keep it the same aswhat they sent us in data file:/d/ftpbu/vwcubu/test/VWCU-FraudLetters-20220718.7z.
If they change it, we have to modify the program again. That will not make this faster/easier.

and

I found that the highlighted text are not completed and it looks like out of bound.
This can be fixed by client. (Note that addresses line and notice date *cannot* be changed.)
Please request a fixed test file.

Thanks

comment: Hi [~zhuoxinT],

Thank you for checking, the client has responded this morning that there are still some changes on their side based on the testing. They are expecting to send the file early next week.

I will be updating the timeline accordingly. What would be your estimate coding end-date if you receive the samples 9/7? As of today, the coding end day set up for 9/19 and I would need to update this date.

Thank you,

Juliana

I cannot tell right now. 
For pdf data, we have to test with the software first.
If there's any issue, that will delay the end-date.

Do we have the updated data?
if client fixed the alignment issue, I can generate the sample.


author: JIRAUSER11101
comment: [~Juliana Vannik] 
Sample generated from[^VWCU-FraudLetters-20220912.7z]
only 1 account for each type of letter.
It would be better to have a larger size of data. That's more accurate.

Sorry, please use these as the sample.
101 and 102:[^vwcudlb1224.2o1.pdf]
103:[^vwcudlb1124.2o1.pdf]

regarding to BT-420
[^vwcudlb112.sam.pdf][^vwcudlb122.sam.pdf]these two are just the sample pdf. Not the actual print file. That's why it has incomplete barcode.
