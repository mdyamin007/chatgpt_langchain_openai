title: is-apps-dv-01:  Error message upon login & SSH so slow
description: Hi Prem,

Can you review what is going on with 10.5.20.70 server? Not only is SSH slow, but my /home/williamK directory does not exist.

comment: The ssh doesn't seem to be slow.

I am able to log in pretty quick.

The other issue about accessing the /home/wiiliamK folder

its look like it pointedwilliamK -> /mnt/nfs_prod_home/williamK


looks like something wrong with the autofs configuration.

Need to look in to it deeper to find what exactly wrong with the config

comment: [~premraj.patil]: Thanks for looking into this. You identified the issue. Because it is unable to mount to rhstore with the /home/ directory, that is why it is slow.



The permanent solution is to fix the NFS access issues. I will close this ticket now.
