comment: [~thomasY]This slipped off my radar.

I need an update on the ASAP. The target live is tomorrow and I have not received any parallel paperwork to initiate in teamsupport nor has QA done any validation.

comment: [~dyuen]DPVS is attached. There's only 1 account to print.

comment: Print samples requested.

Note: Per Thomas, if print samples look OK, then we will not need parallel.

2D is showing on the print file. It doesn't look like the right file was printed. The footer looks different.

[~dyuen]

Did you request the samples with the 2nd dpvs (sefcdlc) I attached yesterday? The one QA has looks like it's from the 1st (sefcdlb)

author: dyuen
comment: [~thomasY]I believe so. I used the dpvs titled "sefcdlc106.print". Can you email the dpvs to me and the print filename to request a second set for [~Igor.Khosid]to review?


author: igor.khosid
comment: Second set of the print samples - attached

Wondering if we printed correct notice??


author: dyuen
comment: [~thomasY]I forwarded the DPVS you emailed to OPS for print samples, but the samples Igor just attached are a completely different notice... Please advise.
