comment: client wants to know why so many tokens, and why tokens are required for returning users. Pending DSI response.

testing findings: two tokens are required upon first login, and just one each time thereafter.

comment: waiting for response from mehedi.

Testing shows regardless of using same browser/device still requires a token to login.
