Hi Matt,

This is ready on pilot. The client can go on their admin site on Pilot and download the paperless reports in excel.

comment: Hi Mac,


Client can upload the report in excel However,

The number of "lines" on the excel spreadsheet for the "Acc. Opt-out" report is not the same as the number of accounts listed on the main screen.

I've attached a word document w/ screen shots.

Hi Matt,

The issue is weird as the counts are indeed off by a large amount.

I will need to discuss with my team tomorrow morning to see why.

Hi Matt,
 * Okay, so the reason being that the count shown in the main screen is different than the count in the actual report is because of how we calculate the count shown in the main screen.
 * We use one query to pull information on who opted in and out from day one till the current. We then do some math to figure out the acc_opt_out from the opted in and out for each month. Now, the count can vary because we can run into instances where an account enrolls and unenrolls multiple times in a month rather than just once. This occurs on Pilot because Pilot is our test environment as well so data is changed or manipulated; accounts can be enrolled and unenrolled many times. Thus, this is why we may see a weird count. However, this will not be an issue on Production as we wont have instances where an account is enrolling and unenrolling multiple times in a month.
 * The data in the actual report is accurate and reflects what is to be expected.
 * We use one query to pull the information as it is an effective and fast way to present the data for all the months in that main screen.



I hope this makes sense. Let me know, if you have any questions.



Thanks,

Mac
