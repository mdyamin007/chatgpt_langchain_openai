Would you please ask for a DVPS sample, and then forward to QA? 
I've added a pdf of the DVPS.

Thank you!

comment: Hi[~Peter.Dang]/Chad,

QA usually reviews code before we request print samples. I changed the status to "Request for QA" for them to look at [~Igor.Khosid]

Thanks!

comment: Hi [~Peter.Dang]/Chad, GCBK asked the following question:

Can you confirm, if we want the name in Upper/Lower, would we need to send it that way on the file?

I believe the answer is yes, but I wanted to confirm you before I notify GCBK. Please follow up with [~jharvey]since I'll be OOO from 10/10 - 10/24

Thanks!

comment: Hi [~jharvey], I just wanted to follow up with you on this.  The answer to this question is: However they send the data(upper/lower)- the letter will reflect that. I did follow up with Daphne this morning, but I wanted to make sure that you got this information. 

Thank you!
    Chad

Chad, I will confirm with the client.  Thank you!

Chad,

Please see the request and new data file from client.  In order to have a tap test done to scan to her for review, I need a DPVS for print samples please.

I'm waiting to hear when we will have a production file & if any changes are needed. 

Could you have them run the attached with the upper/lower for names? 

Also, could you scan one inside the envelope, folded so we can see how it aligns? Normally we do the tap test here, but not sure timing allows for the one-time mailing. Even if you did tap test on each side and scanned to show us data didn't get covered and/or show in the window that may work for this type of request. 

Thanks!

I am unable to download the newest print samples to provide to the client.  Would you please try to upload again?


author: mattl
comment: Hi [~Peter.Dang]Client advised the following:

The spacing still doesn't seem to match the examples I provided. It's almost reverse. Should be:(1) Double space after Date (2) Single space after greeting and in between paragraphs (3) Double space between last sentence and Stacys info

I tried to mock one up for reference (attached).

We are hoping to have a production file tomorrow it sounds like as well.

I've updated this direct mail, and have provided the new DVPS file.

Chad,

Client approved samples. I will comment here once they provide production file.

comment: [~Peter.Dang],

Chad please see the following from GCBK. Can you confirm if the "Address Line 2" column will cause an issue?

Hello!

I just sent the Production file to the Test folder on the FTP (encrypted). The count is less than estimated (15,823).

!image-2022-10-25-16-06-47-144.png!

Hopefully this won't cause an issue, but we had to add an "Address Line 2" column. Unfortunately, our test file was so small, it didn't have any accounts with a second address line when actually there is some in the production file, so want to point that out before you run it.

!image-2022-10-25-16-06-57-433.png!



Can you provide a few samples from production before you release them to print for a final look?

Also, can you let us know when these will be dropped in the mail as communication needs to go out internally.

Thank you!! Candace



Thanks!

comment: [~dyuen] with the added address 2 field in the data, I'll need to account for an extra hour because I'll have to rework the address and txt record. 
Please advise on what to do next.

Thank you!


author: dyuen
comment: [~Peter.Dang]/Chad, please re-work. I'll let GCBK know about the delay/change that needs to be done. Once completed, please let me know so that I can have DP process the prod file for production.

Thanks!
