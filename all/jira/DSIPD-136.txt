title: JobStatus - Vue.js modules cache busting enabled
description: Vue.js is used for single page application, so all the assets are loaded at first which is little bit bigger. So, by default browser is set to cache once it gets loaded. For this feature user is no longer need to download the same assets again. But problem arises if there's been some changes. User need to clean their caches to get updates. Luckily there's a fix for this problem. It's called cache busting. Now, end user don't need to worry about cleaning their browser cache :)
