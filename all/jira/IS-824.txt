comment: Currently waiting for client to provide the font name used in the latest test file pdfs (/d/ftpbu/msbkbu/TEST/msbk_ics.zip.pgp) since we need to install the font on RedTitan. Apparently, the client is unable to revert the font to what they had before in the sample set or

Note that we may need to purchase said font and charge the client for it as a separate item.

Per SOW, the naming convention to follow is:MSBK_[app]__archival_<mmddyy>_<seg#>.zip.pgp

Note that the existing daily PDF notice follows: msbk_dn1_PDFNotices_archival_<mmddyyyy>.zip

Per our conversation, archival is not be encrypted. Please let me know if naming needs to be changed.

comment: [~SamV2021] MSBK says for archival feedback:

A couple follow-up items:


 # We have decided a name for the file: MSBDD0001-InfoImage ICS Statements Keri  this is mostly internal. We dont need the file name that you send us changed at all. We just need this name/number referenced on the header for the archive file instead of the Credit Score Disclosure verbiage.


 # We also need to update the header on the archive file, to reflect the new name please.



They will be sending a new test file. If it is easy please send me a sample.. I will need a new arachival with the changes above as well.



Thanks!

Attached new samples:[^msbkics28_sample.pdf]

Keri, can you also confirm with the client regarding the # of possible pages for an account? Per the SOW, "Notices will be 2-13 pages", but an account was found in this latest test filemsbk_ics_02282022.zip.pgp that contains 14 pages. I have attached this account to the above sample.

Archival filemsbk_ics_archival_022822_1.zip is available in client pickup.

comment: [~SamV2021] MSBK says:


 * The file will fluctuate on the number of pages. We need to just code these as such.


 * The file you sent  we would like to confirm it was intentional to only 2 accounts, omitting the others that were in the file we originally sent for the sample.


 * The date on the Archive file is incorrect, the date should match the date of the file, not the date it was processed. We sent the file with the name of msbk_ics_02282022 and it had a date of 2022  03 -29

Regarding client feedback:
 # The program will be able to accommodate any number of pages. The only thing is that if the client cannot guarantee that the number of possible pages for an account is 15 or below, then we will just need to make sure we generate a heavy (.hvy) print file for testing, and perform tap test. Would the client be able to provide a test file with an account containing more than 15 pages?
 # That is correct, I just omitted the other accounts in the file so that it is smaller in size.
 # I can make the appropriate changes so that the date from the input file is used instead, but just note that the daily notices is currently set up to use the processing date when it comes to displaying the banner page in the archival file. Should I go ahead and make the change for this ICS notice?

comment: [~SamV2021] they cannot guarantee all accounts will be under 7 sheets and they do not have any samples of that to test with.

PDF Notices are not set up w processing date. There is a change order/Jira that was released the beginning of the month. please provide a new archival sample.

Thanks!
