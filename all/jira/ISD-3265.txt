title: Global - Accounting Report Summary to Distinguish Between Emails and Attachment Emails
description: **Update only for the DefaultReport handler in accounting2.



Summary section should have an additional columns called "Email Attach" just like in the eStatement Email Notifications section. Then all reported email jobs should display whether the emails were normal Email or Email Attach accordingly.

comment: Hi [~tai.trinh] ,

Currently, the sum of good,bad and warning from p_job table are being displayed as the value of "Email" column of "Accounting Summary information" section. Is there any reason to show like this? 
Because, in "*eStatement Email Notification*" section, "*email_count*" and "*email_attachment_count*" from p_email_count table are displayed as the value of "*Email*" and "*Email Attach*" column respectively. Should I show "*email_attachment_count*" from p_email_count table as the value of "*Email Attach*" in "Accounting Summary Information" section? If I show the value of "Email" and "Email Attach" in the "Accounting Summary Information" section like the "eStatement Email Notification" section i.e. "email_count", "email_attachment_count" from p_email_count table, what should I do with the "SMS" field of "eStatement Email Notification" section?

Thanks
Moshiur
