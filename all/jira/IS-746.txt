Attaching logos and gradients TIFF images; this will be used as Embedded Resources, to replace current 'preprint'.

Grey backer is used for print; b/w backer is used for PDF archival and eStmt (if applicable).

Also, new stock code = 3706 (I'll update the SOW).

comment: Hi [~phoebe.george]
Can you provide the gray backer ? And can you mention the place for printing "Home Equity Line of Credit" tiff? Can we have the mock up for HELOC? 


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~mousumiS] I have attached the following:
 # Grey backer - should be back of page 1 only.
 # HELOC name
 # Sample of current HELOC stmt

I will update the SOW as well to the following:
 # Page 1 (front): Color logo/name/gradient.
 # Page 1 (back): Grey disclosure for print; black disclosure for electronic/PDF archival.
 # Page 2 (front/back): NO gradient background; logo in b/w

comment: Hi [~phoebe.george], [~diegof]
The 2 samples are attached in client pickup today. The last submitted sample had some issues, so we have to fix those and regenerate the samples. Please check the samples from client pick up and let us know if there any issue. 

N.B. The balance in transaction part is all zero because the mapping says it comes from </RunningBal>. But there is no value in this tag. So, it is zero. 

Thank you
Sumi


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~mousumiS] what is the file name and location for the samples - I need to forward to DP to retrieve. Thanks!


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~mousumiS] [~sadiqs] [~diegof] SSCU has provided their first round feedback for HELOC statement samples as of yesterday - here is the external smartsheet that I shared with the dsi email alias:

[https://app.smartsheet.com/sheets/PMVrVx2QpG4rvwfW3jRH69JmvFXXvG7wvW9qMXM1]

Is there a zoom chat for SSCU HELOC? If so, please add me too.

Thank you,

Phoebe

author: mousumis
comment: Hi [~phoebe.george] [~diegof]
The sample with SSCU_LN_BLXTR_03102022_1.XML.pgp is attached in client pickup. The other datafile do not cover HELOC criteria, so we can't provide the samples with those data. The sample satisfies 47, 49 and 50 issues from smartsheet too. 

Please check and suggest if there is any issue. 

Thank you
Sumi.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~mousumiS] [~sadiqs] - SSCU approved the PDF archival samples and electronic posting to pilot. We are still pending final approval on samples.

Please provide DPVS ahead of time if possible still so that we can test color printing/matching since we updated with a new logo.

Thank you!

Return this top portion to the SAFE address listed above with a check made payable to SAFE Credit Union. Include your account number on the check.

Note that you may need to shrink the font in order for all of it to fit.

Please provide a small sample set and DPVS so I can get approved this morning.

There should be NO MORE data changes at this time. If you want to prepare for QA ahead, since we are behind schedule on this due to the final edit as well.

Just wondering, what is the Stock code should be 3705 or 3706? On the provided print samples - 3706, however in the SOW 3705

author: phoebe.george
comment: Sorry [~Igor.Khosid] , it should be #3706! I'll update the SOW now. I double checked the information with Gabriel. The print samples are correct.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~Igor.Khosid] Actually, are you checking the correct SOW? I'm showing it does have 3706 already:
