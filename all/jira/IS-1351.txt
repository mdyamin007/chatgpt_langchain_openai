comment: Hi [~zhuoxinT], SEFC signed/TO'ed the work order a couple days past the turnover date. If it's too tight of a turnaround, let me know and we can adjust the days.

Thanks

comment: Hi [~zhuoxinT], FYI SEFC responded to your question in the ticket.

Comment 75 on ticket #27556:

"We do not need and do not want the info below on the HLFR statements 9(aka Home Equity Line Fixed Repay" accounts:.

1. '***'

2 'AVAILABLE CREDIT:   '

3. '*** Your loan has a variable rate feature and the annual percentage rate may vary.'

These are fixed rate loans and do not have a credit limit or available balance. Thank you for verifying. djb"

Note: for account 1697393080. the product description header is printing the "HEATHER LANE HELOC". It's getting from data file.
if data file is empty at that line POS 297. then it will print the minor production description "HOME EQUITY REPAY"

comment: [~zhuoxinT] - thank you for your help and explain the updates.

[~dyuen] - sounds like this is ready for the client review with some questions for Zhuoxin


author: dyuen
comment: Thank you, Samples have been forwarded to SEFC as well as the note for the account ending in 3080




author: dyuen
comment: [~zhuoxinT], samples are approved.

"Thank you, Daphne. These statements look fine - approved.

To be honest, I didn't even know a member could rename a loan but I see they can. Your logic is correct, if there is no rename - use the minor name as you noted."

Per Jira description, there is no parallel, please confirm once code has been released.

Thanks
