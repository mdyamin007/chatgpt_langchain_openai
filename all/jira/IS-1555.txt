The verbiage is changed alright, ready for client review.

My suggestion would be to center-align 'Post Date' with respect to the dates column.
 I understand that originally there was right alignment, as in other columns. But these other columns are numbers , and with the dates column the heading looks somewhat off, seeing that we always expect 5 characters for a date.

That is a matter of taste, of course, so it's up to the client.
