title: 21102 - TKCU - Notice desc not showing
description: tkcu docdesc changes were released with the latest prod branch by mistake and docdesc table was still empty. Added notice descriptions and restarted servers to display the descriptions, still need to find time to release email handler updates to pui as well. I don't think it should have any effect since the descriptions in tkcuenoticedesc and docdesc table are the same currently, but will try to deploy the change asap.
