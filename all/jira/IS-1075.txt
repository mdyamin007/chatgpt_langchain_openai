Kris - please advise, what should be the zip file name? can you attach an updated SOW?

the description doesn't match the output.

per description should be :

Zip Name: KFCU_DailyLetter_Archival_mmddyy_<#seg>_<#seq>.zip

ex. KFCU_*{color:#ff8b00}DailyLetter{color}*_Archival_041322_1*{color:#ff8b00}_1{color}*.zip

OUTPUT displaysKFCU_DN_Archival_031120_1.zip

!zip file name doesnt match.GIF!
