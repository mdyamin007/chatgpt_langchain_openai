comment: [~dyuen] Is there going to be new letter for enotice?


author: dyuen
comment: [~Tin.Chak], I believe so.


author: dyuen
comment: [~Tin.Chak], disregard my previous comment. Per Thomas, all these letters will fall under letter code 027.


author: 5b1ee5a72eea651bacdeca2e
comment: [~dyuen] The existing description is "HELOC Draw Reminder Letter (6 Months Out)", so no change to that?


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~dyuen] I don't see anyone assigned to this ISD story, does this still require us to add a new letter? If so, please update the due date and we can get it assigned.


author: dyuen
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima]yes it does. I updated the due date, please let me know when the story has been assigned. Thanks!


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~dyuen] thanks, I assigned it to myself. We already have letter code 027 with description "HELOC Draw Reminder Letter (6 Months Out)" in our system. Assuming there is no change to the description, we don't need to make any code/configuration updates. At most it requires testing/validation once we receive the index file from IS.

comment: [~dyuen] [~gthillaivel] I added letter code descriptions for 049 - 056 onto all lower environments per the SOW:

049 - HELOC Draw Reminder Letter (180 Days)
050 - HELOC Draw Reminder Letter (180 Days)
051 - HELOC Draw Reminder Letter (90 Days)
052 - HELOC Draw Reminder Letter (90 Days)
053 - HELOC Draw Reminder Letter (30 Days)
054 - HELOC Draw Reminder Letter (30 Days)
055 - HELOC Draw Reminder Letter (0 Days)
056 - HELOC Draw Reminder Letter (0 Days)

Once we have the new index file with the updated letter codes from Thomas, we should be able to verify that the descriptions match.


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: Updated due date to 8/19 per Tun's comment on the IS story. The update on ISD's end is just adding the new letter code descriptions, so it can be completed whenever we are ready to proceed to production.

comment: [~dyuen] I added letter descriptions for codes 049 - 056 onto production, closing story.
