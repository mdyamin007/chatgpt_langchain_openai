Please attach the updated SOW with the mail code updates. Just to confirm, the current code is set at V500_F17 and the change is to V200_F1, and the electronic selection is the same atV200_F23.

comment: Hi Natalie,



We need to remove the suppression based on the V500_F17 and just use V200_F1 and V200_F23. SOW updated with the logic. It should be the same across all loan applications. So, you can talk to Nar and see how he does it.



Thanks,


Enrico

To confirm the logic since it seems to have been updated again.
For V200_F1, if it's 1, 2 or 99 then suppress. If V200_F1 == ' ' AND V200_F23 == 1, then suppress.

But if V200_F1 == ' ' AND V200_F23 is ' ', 0, or 2 then don't change the mail code to suppress

I don't see an account: 7485 and the closest account 174852 doesn't have the updated change to verify.

Project file:

Sample attached:
[^sacu_sample.pdf]

QA checklist:
[^qa_check_list_sacumv2_updates.pdf]

Notes: 
As for the endorsement, the update was already made to the control file and released at the end of last month so the update doesn't need to be made. The project file contains a data file that has both the account numbers asked for the sample and additional accounts to verify the mail code suppression.
