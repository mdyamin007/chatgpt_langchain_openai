These cids are not found in oracle db, so it looks like there are no data for these in oracle db.

comment: Hi [~jwhang] I checked CFCU as well as a few others from the list and I still see their data in the production schema. Can you double check? Also can you please remove all data from the dev, pilot, and stage schemas as well?

comment: [~jwhang] I'm still seeing acct_numbers in the fin_account table for CFCU on prod default in addition to fin_account and estmt_doc data for all lower environments. Can you please remove all data on all environments for CFCU as well as the other discontinued cids mentioned?
