comment: [~rony] [~misbah.uddin@dsinnovators.com]- Response to the questions...

So the update is "If there is a credit balance, would update do "DO NOT PAY-CREDIT BALANCE" and remove all special characters from scan line." *YES*



So if TCD amount value has parenthesis displayDO NOT PAY-<TCD value> ? *YES*



And with same condition will remove the entire ocr line? Currently the ocr line is being printed if it is no Autopay. *PRINT OCR LINE BUT WITH NO ADDITIONAL CHARACTERS.*



And regarding comment 5 I don't see any Ending Balance but Remaining Balance, so do we need to change from*Remaining Balance*to*Previous Balance*. *YES*

Can you confirm, "Not erolled in Autopay" line should be hardcoded or not? . In the PDF sample provided,this line is not included

 !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! 


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: Hi [~gthillaivel]- that verbiage is keyed off on a flag in the data. So yes, I believe we should be printing "Not enrolled in Autopay" on the statement to the right.

[~misbah.uddin@dsinnovators.com]- Please advise.


author: JIRAUSER11800
comment: Hi [~gthillaivel],

As [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]mentioned in previous comment,that verbiage is keyed off on a flag (ACH) in the data. The last account of the sample that I provided has"Not enrolled in Autopay" verbiage.



Thanks




author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~misbah.uddin@dsinnovators.com]- Please see attached update requests. SURU would like us to remove "Spread Solar, Get Paid" verbiage on the right. Also update the "Auto Pay is On" message that prints on the coupon on the bottom right.

comment: Hi [~gthillaivel]/ [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]

Additional Updates:

1. "Spread Solar, Get Paid" verbiage on the right is removed.

2."Auto Pay is On" messagethat prints on the coupon on the bottom right is updated such as:

    - Ifthere is a credit balance, "Your payment will process one business day before your due date." is replaced by "Credit Balance - No        ACH will draft until Credit is used in full"

*Updated sample*:[^surums5125_4.pdf]



Thanks


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~enricob]- SURU has a follow up question. Do their Electricity statements break out the Tax and Late fees on the statement? I see Tax on the mapping but not late fees. Do you recall if you mapped this?

For the 2nd record in the sample  surums5125_4.pdf provided by DSI, The specical characters schould not be removed as it does not fall under the credit balance or "DO NOT PAY-CREDIT BALANCE" .Looks like a bug 
 !screenshot-6.png|thumbnail! 


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~gthillaivel]- this is correct. If you look, Auto Pay is on. So that means the customer will NOT send in their payment. Thus, no special character MICR line.

 # Twice payment is coming from the data file. Payment has appeared twice in the data file.

 # I think that when Autopay is on, we removed the red one(red marked in the screenshot), not the green one(green marked).

For the first item,as the duplicate field "Payment " appears due to data issue,Passing this 
For the second item above, the second line (red marked) should be removed. I was looking at wrong one.
