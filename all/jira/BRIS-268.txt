title: Staging Prism dependencies 
description: Hi Network,

I am trying to set up the staging environment as from our last call. I have tested and for Prism, I am not able to telnet to certain servers. For prism, the dependencies in red, the prism server is not able to telnet with the port.

comment: [~Bryant.Tran]- can you recheck...I think the only one i'm not sure of is connecting back to the ca mongo servers....is that needed?
