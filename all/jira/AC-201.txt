_ Update visa program fot account ID field as follow.
- Clinet send a monthly file (VWCU_PROMO_mmddyy.txt) that you use in order to print the appropriate promotional information on the VISA statement.
The file now contains a 4 digit account ID (i.e. 0020), where before the file only contained a 2 digit account ID (i.e. 20).
This resulted in the information not printing.
