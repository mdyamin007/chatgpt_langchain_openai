comment: Hi Jason,

Same issue as IBTL-87. Please wait for Ernest's response for IBTL-87.

You can rerun after IBTL-87 is resolved.

Thanks,

comment: [~jasramos]: Can you confirm that you placed the data file into the ftpscanner (i.e. /z/infoftp_int/$cid/.../.../). I+think+ the issue is related to data file not scanned into InfoTRAC.

comment: [~William.Kong] I tried /z/infoftp_int/ewbb on Saturday and the file just stayed there and didn't transfer over. I placed it in /z/infoftps3/ewbb before I left on Saturday, and the file is still there. I'll place it in the internal scanner again and see if the file gets moved over. I will keep you posted. Thanks!

comment: [~Peter.Dang]: Can you assign someone to help troubleshoot the root cause of this issue? I thought it was missing from InfoTRAC database, but I think it might be a different issue.
