title: GCBK - [29004][pvt][Fast Track] Escrow Analysis Statement- Spread time period hard coded?
description: This will be 2hr IS for programming, testing and qa.



Assessment, will get the # of months from data file as per comment #1.



Timeline

Turnover to IS 5/16

QA 5/18

client sample 5/19

client approval 5/20

LIVE date 5/26



Use production file "GCBK_LN_EAS_042622.001.STM". Will need to extract out some accounts with different number of months for testing and create qa list of those accounts.



-------------per client--------------------------

We changed the "spread" of an escrow shortage to 60 months prior to running escrow analysis. The escrow analysis statement produced by infoimage stated "We have decided to collect it over 12 months" instead of "We have decided to collect it over 60 months". Is the number of months in that sentence hard-coded?
