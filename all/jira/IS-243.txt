Note that I will be OOO on 8/5.

[~nischala.manjunath] please inform Keri C and Tye Wu (ISD) as well when the index file is ready; Tye should post these directly to pilot to confirm that it successfully posts. 

If so, we can move forward with QA. Thanks!

comment: HI Nischala,

The index file is missing the image count and causing an error. Can you please fix this one? Thank you in advance!
