comment: [~enricob] i dont see any data file in client pickup folder.
Will you please copy the file in the following location
/d/ac-secure-share/dsi_print/mahbuburT/sfce/data_file

comment: Hi [~enricob] - Please review the interest charge calculation section in the attached demo sample pdf. Should we keep it that way or make any changes? please let us know. Thanks!

author: enricob
comment: Hi Prama,



Client confirmed it looks good.


author: JIRAUSER10909
comment: Hi [~enricob]- for the Interest Charge Calculation section we only need to display all the <interestChargeCalculation type="a"> products that have *<balanceCategory option="B"> Balance transfer*, right? Otherwise, if a product does not have <balanceCategory option="B">Balance transfer, it will not be shown in this section. Please let us know is it correct or we need to display all <interestChargeCalculation type="a"> products?

Thanks!

author: enricob
comment: Let me double check with client. That is what they say on our last call, but they approved the mockup that you provided that has other products.


author: enricob
comment: Per client:

_The Interest Charge Calculation box image you present is what we want to see. The purchase, cash advance, balance transfer, and Promotional APR should all be there_


author: enricob
comment: Attached new test file that has more accounts


author: JIRAUSER10909
comment: Hi [~enricob]-We found the value of the <description> tag is*0% for 12months Bal Transfer Balance transfer*in the most recent data file you provided us. According to the mapping, it should be "Balance Transfer 0% for 12 months Balance transfer". However, it was the same as the mapping in the previous data file.

Please let us know which one is correct. Thanks!

author: enricob
comment: For now, add both as the Promotional APR. I'll check with client on it


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: Inquiry sent to the CU.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~PramaG]- Per CU -0% for 12months Bal Transfer is the correct description


author: JIRAUSER10909
comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] [~enricob]- The sample(*SFCEMV41.pdf*) has been kept at/d/ac-secure-share/dsi_print/pramaG/sfce/sample/ folder. Please review.

We didn't find any account that has the description "0% for 12months Bal Transfer" that CU confirmed lately. But there are accounts in the data file with the description "0% for 12months Bal Transfer Balance transfer". Currently, we are putting the verbiage *Promotional APR*if we find "0% for 12months Bal Transfer" {color:#FF0000}anywhere in the description{color}. Please provide us a data file with the correct description as well as update the mapping.

Thanks!


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~enricob]- Please update the mapping to reflect the update in the above comment.


author: enricob
comment: Mapping updated


author: JIRAUSER10909
comment: Hi [~enricob]-Stephen recently confirmed with CU that "0% for 12 months Bal Transfer" is the correct description.

!image-2022-06-16-15-57-48-148.png!

However, the updated mapping indicates otherwise.

!image-2022-06-16-15-59-31-496.png!

Please let us know which one is correct and update the mapping accordingly.

Thanks!


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~PramaG] [~enricob]- Please hold off for now. CU is confirming if "Promotional APR" is ok. Thanks.

comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]-The SOWs use a different naming convention for zip files. So will there be two zip files with different names for Platinum and Golden Gate Visa?

Please let us know.

author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~PramaG]- The Golden Gate visa stmts will be included in the Platinum Visa data file. So they will come in 1 data file.



Can you please tell me what the existing setup is now? We will want it to stay the same. It looks like they usually send us the Platinum data file using the naming convention - sfce_<MMDDYY>_visa_platinum_<seg#>.zip.pgp. Can you please confirm what the name is inside the zip? I'll update the SOW once you confirm.



Thanks!


author: tanmay
comment: For platinum visa
data file naming convention is
sfce_<MMDDYY>visa_platinum<seg#>.zip.pgp 
which contains
sfce_<MMDDYY>_platinum_<seg>.xml



Now please confirm the naming convention of golden gate visa data file. next approach will depend on naming convention.

And please update sow accordingly , otherwise it will create confusion later.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~tanmay]- Thx! Correct name is...

sfce_<MMDDYY>visa_platinum<seg#>.zip.pgp
which contains 
sfce_<MMDDYY>platinum<seg>.xml.

Basically the Golden Gate data will come in the platinum data file.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~tanmay]- Please advise on QA status.
