title: Confirm Service for Tracking Remit Payments - 14859
description: IM to provide Tyler/PD with the details for reviewing set-up for Confirm Mail Service.

Reference for Level 3 issue for PLBA/FCBT tied to ticket #14660.



Based on L3 internal meeting to discuss a long-term solution, review option to setup 'Confirm Mail Service' as both an internal option for access to view mailed payments internally by InfoIMAGE and/or product offering for the customer.



This used to be an offered service, but was discontinued previously.

If issues happen with IMB barcode and/or need to track incorrectly routed payment mail, this would allow OPS research for these types of issues to discuss with the USPS as needed.



Scheduling a meeting with Tyler to review, but can use this ticket to track IS/ISD/OPS assessment.
