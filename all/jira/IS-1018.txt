SUCU has put this project on hold, as they are having issues with their test database and cannot produce a new/larger test file until mid-July timeframe. I will note the status as ON HOLD for now, but will discuss with the IS managers during the resource meeting for re-scheduling.

Let me know if any questions.

SUCU has completed their test database update and was able to generate a new test file.

I need to talk with IS managers on re-scheduling this project. In the meantime, they requested if we could run this new file based on the program that you have completed so far in order to provide next set of feedback. I will request new dates from IS in the meantime. Let me know if any questions though. Thanks!

New test file name attached: LN_BLXTR

comment: Hi [~phoebe.george],

Attached file isLN_BLXTR.LIS which is not the datafile I think, as it was supposed to be xml file. Can you please confirm.

Thanks

comment: [~Najoa] Sorry, I did not catch that in the file extension! I have requested a replacement file.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~Najoa] , the new test file was too large to attach, so I copied to this location:

ac-secure-share (\\ca-issshare-01.infoimageinc.com)\V:\dsi_print\najoaS\sucu\loanbill\LN_BLXTR.xml

comment: [~Najoa] [~fahad] I can't recall if you're OOO today. On our zoom chat, i believe you had tried to run the new test file and there was overprinting. Can you still send me those samples? I'm getting this job re-scheduled for resourcing, but wanted to send SUCU the prelim samples based on your current program so they can determine if their test data is pulling accurately from their core. Let me know if possible. Thank you!


author: JIRAUSER10907
comment: Hi [~phoebe.george], kept the sample in this path /d/ac-secure-share/dsi_print/najoaS/sucu/loanbill/ and filename: sucuml1.pdf

comment: Hi [~phoebe.george],

Please let us know the new timeline as dev is busy with other projects also so we need to match the time


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~Najoa] The date that Peter provided has a new start date of 11/1. However, I'm still hoping we can push this date up to begin sooner if possible in October timeframe.


author: JIRAUSER10907
comment: Thanks [~phoebe.george]. Also dev is busy with other projects so it will be better for us to start the project on November.

author: phoebe.george
comment: [~diegof]Can you confirm that Property Address and Collateral Address are the same field? Are there any instances in the test files (attached to this ticket) that include multiple Collateral addresses?



Thanks!
