comment: TX Internet is routed to the new AT&T Internet. There are two items pending:



1) DR NAT configurations.

2) ASFC and SANA Backup VPN switchover.

I want to terminate these VPNs on firewall removing the routers there. Also, We need to communicate with the clients about the IP change.

Later, I want to move the VPN from routers to the firewall for Menlo Park (their main VPNs) also.

The TX Centurylink circuit is scheduled to be shut off on the 14th. Can you confirm that the DR NAT is done? Where is the NAT configuration done at? There is a NAT on the VPN router and there are NAT's on the PA FW. Is it just a matter of configuring the FW to new IP's? If so, do you have a list, if you are too busy with BB, i can assign someone to do this? Thanks!
