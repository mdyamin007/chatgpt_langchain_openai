comment: Hi [~phoebe.george] and [~lina], 

FYI the files have been sent via encrypted email to the client for test connectivity today

Thank you!

comment: Ethan,

This was Lin's project. Now, I'm assigning this to you. Thanks.


author: JIRAUSER11300
comment: Hi [~Ethan.Yu]

We have the following feedback provided from the client below. 



_Lumin is having trouble getting the connectivity up and has asked to verify that the information provided in mid-May was still valid._

_I included the InfoIMAGE Service API  Auth Info document that was previously provided, as a reference._ 



Can you please check the connectivity and verify that the connection information that was previously provided is still valid?

Thank you,
Juliana

[~phoebe.george] FYI


author: JIRAUSER11300
comment: [~Ethan.Yu], [~phoebe.george] 



Please disregard the above. The client has just reported they've got the connectivity confirmation from Lumin, that has worked well

Thanks, 
Juliana


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~Ethan.Yu] Can you confirm if the application name/description is populated for the SANA setup for Lumin as well? They asked about the same thing that SLCU did for passing that information through the API call so they can differentiate the different application names on their Lumin UI.

Also, does that description include the names for the tax forms and eNotices also?

[~Juliana Vannik] FYI - once Ethan responds, please assist to update the Corey/Janet at the CU per our call.


author: JIRAUSER11300
comment: Hi [~Ethan.Yu],

Are there any updates regarding the above setup please?

We can't move forward without this info

Thank you,

Juliana


author: 5ba31365b1a4b82e99864b79
comment: I'll check if the descriptions are all updated.

If they aren't I'l update them.



The description includes the names for tax and enotices as well.


author: 5ba31365b1a4b82e99864b79
comment: Hi [~Juliana Vannik],

I confirmed that pilot has all the descriptions for enotices and statments. The etaxes are at the moment a vague "E-Tax" description for etaxes, but the other statements should have the descriptions matching the authentifcation doc sent over to the client. If they run into any issues with the descriptions please ask them for a screenshot.


author: JIRAUSER11300
comment: Good morning [~Ethan.Yu] ,



Thank you! There is one additional question from client:

Additionally, Lumin is requesting a fulllist of all the stmttype valuesthey should be receiving. Is this something that can be provided as well?

Thank you,

Juliana

comment: [~Ethan.Yu] Please note that SANA will be providing final approval on the pilot site by Monday, 9/12.

Their live date for the Lumin API is on 9/20/22, so we will need to target to release either 9/19 or morning of 9/20. We will be meeting with SANA again on 9/13 to finalize since we should have approval by then.

Let us know if there are any issues/questions with this release. Since there is no data migration required, I believe there should not be any downtime - can you confirm?

[~Tin.Chak] [~Juliana Vannik] FYI

[~Juliana Vannik] Please update the due dates to 9/20 on both the Jira Epic and ISD Story.

comment: Hi [~phoebe.george],

Can we ask SANA/Lumin to provide IP addresses that the requests will be coming in from? That way we can whitelist it for them.

comment: Hi [~phoebe.george], [~Juliana Vannik],



That information is correct, but they are missing the initialization vector.

Two things:
 # Have we ever confirmed that they got a successful pilot test?
 # Can we ask them for the full api url request call?

To my knowledge Lumin has never confirmed a successful pilot test for the three tickets: RWCU, SLCU, SANA.

Thanks

comment: [~Ethan.Yu] Lumin was definitely able to connect to the pilot site; SANA validated all eStatements/documents on pilot site previously during testing. 

We will share this info with Lumin and will cc you.

Thanks!

comment: Hi [~Juliana Vannik],



In the future, when the vendor is ready to test the production connectivity, let's set up a meeting to do it so that InfoIMAGE can monitor the logs.



Common configurations that may be missed:

Infoconfig: ArchivalPeriod and Statement properties

MongoDB: client properties



Thanks!
