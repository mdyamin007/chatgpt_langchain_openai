Wilson,

Please find the answers to your questions below:
 # In the sample docx you attached. There is a graphical header on the first page and footer at the second page. Do you want an exact replica of that?

If so, can you send us the footer and header?

{color:#de350b}Please use thesame letterhead as the Minor Account Letter as requested.{color}

2.If it's 2 pages, is this duplex or simplex?

{color:#de350b}The letter should only be one page.{color}

3.What should this letter be called? Right Start Letter?

{color:#de350b}Yes, that is fine.{color}
