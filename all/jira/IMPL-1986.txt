title: MFCU [27665] [pvt] Credit Card Statement Changes - Formatting Fix, BT Interest and Promos RUSH for 4/15 LIVE
description: *Must be live for the 4/18 production cycle.*
# # Formatting issue with Minimum Payment Warning  looks like they are running out of space and as a result the balances is bleeding below the line.  This is happening for people who have higher balances.
# Adding BTs to Interest Charge section even if zero  we added BTs even if $0.00 in the summary but we missed to add it in the Interest Charge section as well.  This will add BTs to that section even if $0.00.
# Better description for balance transfers  we feel the promo descriptions arent very intuitive to the member.  I think the old descriptions were Promo Rate #.  
For #3 we would like to change the descriptions to: Balance Transfer Promo or Cash Advance Promo or Purchase Promo.  Basically remove the word "Rate" from those lines.


#1 needs to be fixed by next cycles because it is a formatting issue.  #2 also needs to be done by next cycle. If the 3rd will delay this, then please prioritize #1 and #2.
