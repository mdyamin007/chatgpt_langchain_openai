Please see below client concern:

Please confirm the Pilot is:[https://bbbbpilot.infoimageinc.com/msm/login.jsp] 

This pilot program listed above is for the admin site. While logged in, I tried to search clients to view if the new email address was listed anywhere on their statement and wasn't able to see any statements to preview. Is this the correct pilot site? If so, can you please provide steps of what I should be doing?


author: 5b1ee5a72eea651bacdeca2e
comment: [~Kbittmann] The URL is listed is the pilot admin site. They need to login through Online Banking that points to our pilot. If the bank don't have access to that, they can just review the screenshot that we will provide.

[~Azad] Can you attach a screenshot of all the areas with the new email address? Thanks.

comment: Thank you[~Tin.Chak].

[~Kbittmann], I am attaching 3 screenshots of 3 areas (eStatement page, update email page, terms & condition page) with the new email address from Pilot customer site. Please review and let me know if you need anything.

Thanks

Please see client feedback below:

I reviewed all of the screenshots and everything looks great. :) Please let me know when the changes are live.

Also- I do not have access to the Online Banking that points to the pilot program. Is that something you are able to help me access for future reference?

comment: [~Kbittmann] The bank need to contact their vendor to have an Online Banking test portal that point to our pilot site. If the bank don't already have a test portal available, then it's best for us to only provide screenshots for cosmetic changes.

Hi Azad,

I can't make work SSO on staging, it gives error on second submit, I take random UniqueID from DB, I think i have correct entry in host file 10.5.16.191 bbbbstage.infoimageinc.com, I am using iFrame tab to test and I was trying on all servers, just in case.

Thank you,

Natasha

comment: Hi [~nprimak],

The entry on the host file is correct. You have to add the port(9680) too with the request url. The Form URL on the client-test page should be like this: [https://bbbbstage.infoimageinc.com:9680/|https://bbbbpilot.infoimageinc.com:9680/]

You can check if the application is up and running by hitting the hearbeat url: [https://bbbbstage.infoimageinc.com:9680/heartbeat.jsp]

Also, for simplicity, you can skip the UniqueID generation via NetTeller and CashMgmt value. Instead get the UniqueID from the database directly. You can use the_vendor_user_id_column's value on the_USR_SESSION_ table, as the UniqueID.

Pass the UniqueID value on the second submit and get the ConnectionString. Pass them both on the third submit and hopefully you will be logged into the BBBB customer site with the user for whom the_vendor_user_id's_ value was used.

Hopefully this will solve your problem. Let me know if you need anything.

[~Tin.Chak] [~Igor.Khosid]FYI.

Thank you,

Azad

Hi Azhar,

I did everything you described above yesterday, I still have error.

I use this query to find UniqueID:

select vendor_user_id "UniqueID", acct_number 
from usr_session us, usr_fin_account ufa, fin_account fa
where us.usr_id=ufa.usr_id and ufa.acct_id=fa.acct_id and us.org_id=getorgid('bbbb');

The URL you have me [https://bbbbstage.infoimageinc.com:9680/heartbeat.jsp] is alive, no error there.

On my second submit I have strange issue, I see page in a view of testing SSO. under Connection String.

I am attaching screenshot. file 060922_BBBB.png

Thank you,

Natasha

Azad, sorry, ignore my previous comments, I use net-teller tab and skipping first step and SSO is working well.

I will verify changes and update story today. I need to find UniqueID not used before to go through enrollment steps.

Thank you,

Natasha
