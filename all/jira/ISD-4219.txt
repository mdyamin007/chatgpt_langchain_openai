title: SANA Check image not showing
description: If you use account number 83100402 to SSO on Pilot, in the check tab, the image #523 is not supposed to work. However, this means the vendor should be sending a Check Image Not Available image to us. And they are sending this, but somehow, the code cannot display it.
If I access the URL directly (taken from logs), I get the image: 
https://image.swcorp.org/cgi-bin/MbrImage.asp?Account=83100402&Amount=550.00&Serial=523&Date=20190508&RQSTRID=7oetsdwxqi&CUID=314088284&Sequence=000000000000000&ImageFB=b&MAC=7c6d6034b291526bf6384df29a589b16
However, on the eStatement Site, it's not displaying. I think it has to do with the way that this class (com.infoimage.financial.security.SWCImageServlet) modify the image, but I can't figure out what it is. It can serve the other images fine (the valid check image). I don't see why it can't serve this image.
