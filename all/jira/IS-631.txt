I just saw client's comment on ticket #24388 that the Escrow History total is incorrect. I have made the update.

Here is the new sample and DPVS for laser print (any print range).

comment: [~yameelee]If they send us a new test file tomorrow can we still make the live date before the EOM?

comment: Hi [~yameelee]Client approved yesterday afternoon.


author: yameelee
comment: [~Igor.Khosid] [~berezinez]I think you still need laser print samples?

Please let [~MattL]know if you do. We still have to do parallel.

DPVS is up to date, can print .is file as update is affective to all accounts.
