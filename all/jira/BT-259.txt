title: Noticeable compression artefacts in logo image
description: ... may be not obvious in print, but are quite unpleasant to look at in e-documents.

The new logo has visible compression artifacts. The client provided an image without artifacts. The old logo did not have visible artifacts:

Thus I suppose it is fixable.
I don't know our software capabilities, but I strongly suggest lossless compression for images with limited number of colors.

comment: [~avannik]I can look to see if there is any way to increase the resolution of these images. However the image given by the client is too large to fit on the screen hence the image resolution decrease. I will see if I can scale the image without changing resolution

comment: [~avannik]at this point we do not have time to change the logo resolution it has to go as is
