comment: [~shailendrar]: This is a new project task I'd like you to help me install. All that is left over is to run DockerFile OR pull from our dockerhub the InfoSYNC API image.

Just run a+quick+ short functional test to ensure we are able to establish connection.

Identify if there is any Menlo Park hardcode information that needs to be changed (e.g.: Oracle Database IP, Vision-S MS SQL, etc etc..); I will share with you the new hostname that we can update for both this Brisbane & Menlo Park version.



The goal for this ticket is to setup the API and have it functional;

I will give the temporary password to you tomorrow.
