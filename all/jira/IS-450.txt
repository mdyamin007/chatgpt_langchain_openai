The samples have 0.00 for late charge values. Can you please advise? 

Thanks, Barnett 


author: jira_naru
comment: Barnett:

The data is print image. So, in this case, the Lat Charge comes to us with 0.00 amount therefore, that is how we display the value, 0.00.

!image-2021-11-02-08-59-46-913.png|width=521,height=233!

However, I have additional test file where the Late Charge is not 0.00. New sample attached.
