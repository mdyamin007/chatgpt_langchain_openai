UnZip 6.00 of 20 April 2009, by Info-ZIP. Maintained by C. Spieler. Send
bug reports using http://www.info-zip.org/zip-bug.html; see README for details.

Usage: unzip [-Z] [-opts[modifiers]] file[.zip] [list] [-x xlist] [-d exdir]
 Default action is to extract files in list, except those in xlist, to exdir;
 file[.zip] may be a wildcard. -Z => ZipInfo mode ("unzip -Z" for usage).

-p extract files to pipe, no messages -l list files (short format)
 -f freshen existing files, create none -t test compressed archive data
 -u update files, create if necessary -z display archive comment only
 -v list verbosely/show version info -T timestamp archive to latest
 -x exclude files that follow (in xlist) -d extract files into exdir
modifiers:
 -n never overwrite existing files -q quiet mode (-qq => quieter)
 -o overwrite files WITHOUT prompting -a auto-convert any text files
 -j junk paths (do not make directories) -aa treat ALL files as text
 -U use escapes for all non-ASCII Unicode -UU ignore any Unicode fields
 -C match filenames case-insensitively -L make (some) names lowercase
 -X restore UID/GID info -V retain VMS version numbers
 -K keep setuid/setgid/tacky permissions -M pipe through "more" pager
 -O CHARSET specify a character encoding for DOS, Windows and OS/2 archives
 -I CHARSET specify a character encoding for UNIX and other archives

See "unzip -hh" or unzip.txt for more help. Examples:
 unzip data1 -x joe => extract all files except joe from zipfile data1.zip
 unzip -p foo | more => send contents of foo.zip via pipe into program more
 unzip -fo foo ReadMe => quietly replace existing ReadMe if archive file newer
find: `/d/wfcu/stmt/': No such file or directory

comment: [~cesarg]: Sorry can you retest. This was a global issue. I didn't sync /d/ folders & files; Also, last night i had to ask Prem to assist and redo the entire /d/ partition because it was only 229GB in size. We increased it to 4TB of storage.



Thanks!

comment: [~cesarg]: Can you re-test? Cely created the insert on DataTRAC so the missing piece error message should be taken care of.
