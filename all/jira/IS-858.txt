title: MFCU - TS26478 Mortgage Update to center body of eStatement pdf
description: We want to center the statement on the PDFs in eStatements. On print because of the bardcoding on the left margin, the body of the statement is pushed to the right. In eStatements we want the body center on the PDF.



In addition, please setup FTP Trigger to automate the process when this file arrives.

comment: [~andreav]: I don't think this change has be be made on the 2/28 since it cycles around the 14th. If there are no objections, can we please change the due date to be 3/9/2022 instead?



[~jira_naru]: Please start the update. I also think today was the day everyone got trained on how to install FTP trigger by Andy from this morning's training. If so, please also include this logic as well.

comment: [~andreav]: When can MFCU approve this project? Approvla date is past due. I would like to get this approved and released early and on time.


author: andreav
comment: Will, I thought the code was already released on 2/28?


author: andreav
comment: sorry, ignore my last comment Will, I was looking at Mo Stmts.


author: andreav
comment: I am confused why this is already in QA if the client has not approved the sample yet. I will forward the sample to them for approval.

comment: Releasing these changes along with IS-917 & IS-914.


author: andreav
comment: William, can we release this change as soon as parallel is done since IS-914 and IS-917 are not going live till 3/17? The client sent an email to confirm the production will go smoothly so we need to have the automation ready. See Carlo's email below.

_Our expectation is file processing should go as smooth as it did last cycle and proofs will be ready for us at 7:00 am PT, when we intend to start proofing.  Once approved, mortgage statements should upload to eStatements and eNotifications to go out same day, on Sunday 3/13/22.  Print and mailing will be the following Monday 3/14/22.  Please confirm this can be accomplished._


author: william.kong
comment: [~andreav]: Is the live date 3/17 or 3/14. Nar mentioned 3/14. If it is 3/17, then I will update ALL 3 Jira tickets to 3/17.



FTPTrigger is setup as part of scope of this request. We will need to double check with [~Ethan.Yu]that the FTP trigger automation is setup on ISD side as well. Can you check in with [~Ethan.Yu]if he is done on his part with the FTP trigger logic.
