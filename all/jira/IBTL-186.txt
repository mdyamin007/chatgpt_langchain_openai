Below command I ran to process:


#cp/t/download/wecu/325180113.20200430.LOANXT.100.XML.ZIP.pgp$d_dir/ftpbu/wecubu/
#rm$home_master/keep/cksum_log/wecuml1_cksum.log

comment: [~rony]: Thanks for reporting. Right now database is expected to be down in preparation for this Saturday's move. I'm going to close this ticket since this is an expected issue.
