title: ca-input-pr-01:  /estmt/input/ Mount Permission Issue
description: [~davidt] and [~Tin.Chak]:

Today, ca-input-pr-01 is not mountable. It was working yesterday. I get a permission denied error message:

!image-2020-10-08-12-28-42-701.png!



The NFS ports are still opened:

Can you confirm if anything is changed/lost? If not, please ensure the following systems have access to this production server:

ca-isis-pr-01

ca-isis-pr-02

ca-isis-pr-03

ca-preproc-pr-02

ca-preproc-pr-03



This is our /etc/fstab:

ca-input-pr-01:/estmt/input /mnt/nfs/isd_input nfs timeo=14,intr,nolock,rsize=32768,wsize=32768
