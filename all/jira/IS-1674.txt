comment: [~Peter.Dang] [~rony] [~mahbubS] [~terrencet] Escalating this now! We need samples asap!!! This job is going live on Friday and sample was due on 10/13. We brought this up on scrum 10/17 and were told this was being taken care of. How many follow ups need to happen before we get a response? This job was turned over on 10/6.

Dpvs[^apcudle118.print]please print 4.2o1 file. Can we please ignore isd index, I need to ask dt job id for that which will cost 1 more day. There is no change that is specific to ISD.



project parallel id already provided in the previous comment.
