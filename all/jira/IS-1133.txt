title: UCCU - [29063][pvt] Additional Statement Verbiage Request 0522 / Rush
description: UCCU - Additional Statement Verbiage Request 0522 / Rush
App: Stmt
Description: Add selective message on the bottom of the statement for selective accounts. This will be from 05/31 - 06/01. The message will need to be back dated after month end.
Parallel required: (Yes)

The verbiage is listed below.
*Verbiage*:

Effective immediately, your new daily debit card spending limits are:

 ATM cash withdrawals: $1,010
 Debit card purchases with PIN: $3,500
 Signature purchases (select credit as the purchase type with your debit card when shopping in-person, or just shop as you normally would online): $7,500

If your card is lost or stolen, contact us immediately at 503-227-5571. If its after hours, call 503-423-8315 or 1-800-422-3132 (option 2) to report it. The important thing is to act fast. Once you report the loss of your card, you won't be held liable for unauthorized charges made afterward.

Tip: To stop fraud in its tracks, turn your card off/on instantly with the Unitus Card Guard mobile app; available on the App Store and Google Play Store.

Your Unitus Visa debit card comes with 24/7 fraud monitoring and Zero Liability protection from Visa, so you wont be held responsible for unauthorized card transactions.

If you have any questions, please reach out to us at 503-227-5571 or via our Virtual Branch found on our website via the "Let's talk!" bubble found in the bottom-right corner of any page within uOnline (on desktop), as well as many of our public web pages including Support, Contact Us, and Branch Appointments.

Sincerely, Unitus Community Credit Union

The overlapped issue is fixed. and some of the accounts that you mention they have no e-statement requirement so it wouldn't be show on the index file. It only shows the one that require estmt.
