comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid],

This is a rush QA request.  It should be a straightforward QA test of member SSO site.  The client wants the fix live by 03/24.  Please have it completed by 03/24 early morning.

There are three phases to QA Testing: "QA reproduces the issue", "I apply the fix", and "QA verifies that the issue is resolved".

QA Reproduces The Issue:
- http://client-test.infoimageinc.com:8070/sso/
- Type in "ctcu" and click on "CTCU"
- Click on "Stage"
- Click on "sso7"
- In encrypt.jsp, change acctNum to 0000049836 and click submit.
- Copy the value from encrypt.jsp and paste it in WESCOMSSO's Data.  Click submit.
- Copy the value from WESCOMSSO and paste it in wc_hblogin.jsp.  Click submit.
- A member's SSO page should open up.
- Attempt to change the member's delivery preference to paper by clicking on "Would you like your statements printed? Click *here to start*"
- You will see that "Would you like your statements printed? Click *here to start*" remains on the page - delivery preference has not changed.

ISD Applies The Fix:
- Please let me know to apply the fix and wait for my confirmation that the fix is in place.

QA Verifies That The Issue Is Resolved
- http://client-test.infoimageinc.com:8070/sso/
- Type in "ctcu" and click on "CTCU"
- Click on "Stage"
- Click on "sso7"
- In encrypt.jsp, change acctNum to 0000049836 and click submit.
- Copy the value from encrypt.jsp and paste it in WESCOMSSO's Data.  Click submit.
- Copy the value from WESCOMSSO and paste it in wc_hblogin.jsp.  Click submit.
- A member's SSO page should open up.
- Attempt to change the member's delivery preference to paper by clicking on "Would you like your statements printed? Click *here to start*"
- You will see that the text has changed - delivery preference has been updated.

If you have any questions/concerns, please let me know.

Thanks.
