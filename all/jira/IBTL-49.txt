title: RCS:  Re-Testing Brisbane VM
description: Server: ca-rcs-pr-01.infoimageinc.com

Re-test to make sure we can add/delete code within Brisbane environment.



*PETER*: Can you assign someone to test the CVS check-in / out program again. CVS just got migrated over with a new IP address and need to re-test this same VM. If there is a server dependency in order to test, then let me know (e.g. It can only run on RHS server only). If that is the case, we will leave this ticket dormant.
