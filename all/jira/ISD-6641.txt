comment: Hi [~MattL],

They will find all these changes on their eStatement site on pilot. We are suppose to see an email update to: [digitalbanking@bakerboyer.com|mailto:digitalbanking@bakerboyer.com]in the descriptions.
 # Log into an unenrolled account. During the enrollment, view the Terms and Conditions. At the bottom should be the new email address.
 # In the eStatements tab(s), you should see the new email address in the description below.
 # In the profile tab, go and update the email address of the account, you should see the new email in the description.

The client should be connecting to the pilot through sso. Can you try again? Thanks.

Client does not know how toconnect via SSO in the pilot version? Can you provide steps? The normal contact isn't in office.

Hi Matt,

So, I don't know whether or not they have SSO access to our pilot site then, they will need to talk to their OLB vendor if they have it setup. I can't provide steps as we only provide the necessary information for their OLB vendor to access our site.

Anyhow, I provided screenshots of the actual changes on pilot.
