Hi Attached is the sample report.

Can you let the client know to review. The previous report we provided was manual. This one will be automated moving forward.

We will also need to know which day of the month they want us to process the report when live.



Thanks

Per the client:

Okay, format is fine.

We would like the file to generate on the 26th of each month if that is doable.
