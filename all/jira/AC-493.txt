Assessment Details (IS):
 * Parallel required: (No) Please QA for suppressing CC-late accounts issue in comment #19 and #20 is fixed.
 * Update UTCU for their enotice to start using the UTCU_XREF_MBR_CC xref
 * Need to update trans_acct_member_utcudla.pl to use and support UTCU_XREF_MBR_CC.txt.
 * The reason is for this update is:

 ** CC-late accounts are suppressed because they are missing from the cross reference file (UTCU_noticexref.csv ).
And the account numbers are not the same between the other notice and notice 10. The last digit is off on the CC notice
 * Currently, Only pdf archival uses UTCU_XREF_MBR_CC.txt,
Enotice uses UTCU_noticexref.csv from /d/custdata/utcu
