title: INHS - Pre-Conversion Script
description: A script to identify all the large-sized AFPs and manually convert them to PDFs. This would basically accomplish the Pre-Conversion that would be done on the Processing UI, but did not happen, either because the configurations were not there or because of the recent issue with the wrapper causing the pre-conversion to fail.
