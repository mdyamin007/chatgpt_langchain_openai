comment: [~jira_naru] - They look good, just a couple of feedback items from me:
1) Per SOW, the account numbers should be masked.
2) There are some statements with Bad Address in the address block. Please confirm these will be suppressed from print per SOW.

[~albertM] - Please provide your feedback as well.

 # For the account number, I am not sure. Please check with Al. Please note that the account number also is in the MICR line. Also, in the PDF sample from the back of the loan statement, the account number are not masked.
 # For the Bad address, yes they are suppressed from print.

In looking at the second round sample data, there seem to be an issue below in red.

In the first set of data, only the last 4 digits was provided. However, in this second round, all account numbers are showing. Also, there appear a tick/apostrophe preceding it which does not look right.

Attached is the data file.
