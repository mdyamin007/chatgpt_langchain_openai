title: Access to Some left out Services for PrintProcess Team
description: [~William.Kong]: Can you please let me know of their new IPs if they changed?

Also, we may not have access to those new IPs yet, so can you please provide access to them for our Print Process Team?

|Jira /Confluence|10.8.11.86|443||

comment: [~William.Kong]: Yes, we have access to Jira and Papyrus now.

But we still *don't* have/know the new hostname/IP address of the*sharepoint-svr*server.

Can please share its info and give the necessary permission.
