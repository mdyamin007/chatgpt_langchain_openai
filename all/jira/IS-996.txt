comment: HI [~jasonV]- So am I to print these? How will it show what is being suppressed?


author: JIRAUSER11003
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]as discussed in zoom I will provide thea .txt with the count of non prints before and after change


author: JIRAUSER11003
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]please take a look atwhich is production[^bkpldla113.txt]

and the version with suppression:[^bkpldla1131.txt]

I found that no items are being currently suppressed in production for the other apps I will just provide the suppression file




author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: Looks good [~jasonV]! What do you mean by "I found that no items are being currently suppressed in production for the other apps I will just provide the suppression file"?


author: JIRAUSER11003
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]As you see in the file with suppression there are non print files: NONPRINT 0000005 0000005 0000005 0000000 0000005 . In all of the production applications there are no NONPRINT files, so if we see any NONPRINT items in the .txt we know that it is being suppressed correctly.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~jasonV]- Ah, I see what you mean. Ok, this is good to go. Can we roll out or do you need to QA and parallel?

Update to add suppressionto notices if any address contain "DO NOT MAIL, Bad Address , Do Not Delete has been approved. Please prepare for QA and change status to ready for QA. Please provide...

1. Parallel ID
2. Export projects into QA Folder
3. Provide DPVS for print samples.



Approved sample - Jason and I ran an internal test with the DLA files and confirmed suppression was working.
