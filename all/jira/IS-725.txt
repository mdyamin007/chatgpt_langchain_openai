author: dyuen
comment: [~jasonV], SFCE has a minor update/change:

"My accounting team reviewed the 1099NEC form. They made a comment:The 1099-NEC tax form sample appears to be reasonable except for one minor discrepancy.Please have Info Image map the nonemployee compensation amount to Box 7 (State Income) as well."

Can this be done?

Thanks!


author: dyuen
comment: [~jasonV], some more feedback from SFCE:

"The account number field should display the 10digit account number. It appears the 1098, 1099i, 1099q, 1099r, 1099sa, 1099c all have more then the 10digits for the account number "

Thanks!


author: tuna
comment: Hi [~dyuen],



SFCE account number display is masked for paper with last four digits and all masked for etax.

Should we unmasked and display 10 digits account numbers for both paper and etax?

For example,

This is account numbers in 1098 data file: "0000136178L0027"

This is in sample: "******6178L0027"

Should we change to "0000136178"?



Thanks,

Tun

author: gthillaivel
comment: [~jasonV]-Can you update the samples with the latest update ,such that QA can verify and update


author: tuna
comment: Hi [~dyuen],

Should we do the same masking for both paper and etax display.? I do not see client answer that.

First 6 digits with XXXXX

Last 4 digits unmasked.

Example: XXXXXX0123"

author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~TunA] [~jasonV], client confirmed to use the same masking for paper and eTaxes.

Thanks!

comment: Hi [~jasonV], any updates on samples? Thanks


author: JIRAUSER11003
comment: [~dyuen]as we discussed in zoom. The changes have been made and I am currently processing. Will have the samples today.


author: tuna
comment: Hi [~dyuen],



Just for update. Following issue is global issue for 1099NEC tax form program. I need to discuss with [~jun]for update.

That might take time. You might want to provide samples for other forms to client first.



The 1099-NEC tax form sample appears to be reasonable except for one minor discrepancy.Please have Info Image map the nonemployee compensation amount to Box 7 (State Income) as well.



Thanks

Tun

author: dyuen
comment: [~jasonV], per Tun's comment above, can you give me all the samples for the other tax forms? I'll send those over for review first.

Thanks!


author: tuna
comment: HI [~dyuen],

After look around the IRS publication, I don't know what IRS field should we use forBox 7 (State Income) . We don't add for any client. If SFCE wants to add, please provide IRS field position from record B. We can add Box 7 only for SFCE.

I am not sure this is the right thing to ask. You might want double check with [~Jessica].

comment: [~jasonV], client approved!

"My accounting team says it looks good. "

[~gthillaivel], please complete QA ASAP.

Jason, please confirm once code has been released.

Thanks!


author: JIRAUSER11003
comment: [~gthillaivel] [~Igor.Khosid] [~dyuen]

All samples have been approved. Due to the client requesting changes to the tax forms after we started the QA process, there has been 2 minor changes to the parallel environment.

Please look relook atParallel ID:20220117123109

If you need new DPVS or Index files let me know ASAP.



Biggest change that needs to be reviewed is 1099NECGEN_21.dfa to make sure it does not affect other jobs.

I have exported the project to the qa folder.




author: dyuen
comment: [~gthillaivel], any updates on when QA will be completed? I have a couple tax files pending processing.
