comment: [~tohidulI]: I almost missed this ticket because it was still assigned to you. Please remember to assign ticket to me if there is action that you need me to do.



I checked the directory and it did not have permission you stated. I fixed it just now. Please retest. Thanks!

comment: [~tohidulI]: Unfortunately our database server is shutdown now, so we can not have you re-test message manager. And also the PSEG converter license expired, so testing Message Manager will not work.
