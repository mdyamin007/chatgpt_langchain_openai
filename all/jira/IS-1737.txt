Please create bugs for all these issues!

We already discussed and agreed on this previously.
Why do we continue not to supply QA with the necessary testing information?
Where are the mock-ups? We need something to compare the provided pdf too.

comment:  Hi [~berezinez] [~Igor.Khosid]

1) Mockup was never provided. The layout of this letter is cloned from the old daily letter BBBBDL009. 
2) the project has been exported to QA folder under /d/iss/qa/BBBB/BBBBDL032.zip
3) Here is the new index file with the acct number on it:  [^dla_20220913_1_20221118_1208_bbbb.txt]

Here is the update sample with the logo fixed and the bottom client name removed.
