I re-triggered the email job and it ran as expected without any error. You should get an email if I am not mistaken. I found your email address as a recipient on the log.

Jobid:197376
Log: [/usr/local/processing-ui/station/logs/pfcu/email/09302022_0559039.log|http://pui-stage.infoimageinc.com/log.jsp?id=197376]

I am not sure why it failed yesterday. I am guessing it is an issue on the API side.

I am going to undo the document posting job (197336), so that you can post it again and re-trigger the email notification job. Let me know if it works.

Thanks

Checkout this [log|http://pui-stage.infoimageinc.com/log.jsp?id=197411]. I've retrigger the same job and added my email with one of the account and was able to receive email with correct template. See the screenshots attached.
 # [^pfcu_email_received.png]
 # See the [^pfcu_email_job_log_selected_emails.png]from email job log that is showing the email selected to send email.

If you still didn't get the email today, then you can do the following --
 # I am undoing this document posting job, so that you can trigger again. Please trigger this document posting job first. File name:ea1_20220707_1_20220718_1755_pfcu.txt
 # Trigger email notification for this job.

Thanks

I posted again file -> ea1_20220707_1_20220718_1755_pfcu.txt
And triggered email notification for this job.
But I don't receive emails.
Please review this [comment|https://jira.infoimageinc.com/browse/ISD-7309?focusedCommentId=52908&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-52908]
At the same time, this is what [~Tin.Chak] had to say: "it's fine on the PUI side, the issue is the API. Not sure if it's blocked, but infoimageinc.com domain should be whitelisted already"
