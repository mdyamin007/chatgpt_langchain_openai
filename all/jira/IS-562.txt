description: SSCU - Daily Notice Archival Setup 
Description: Setup Archival for SSCU Daily Notices 

Timeline:============= 
Hours for development: 10 hours 
Turnover Date : 02/09/2022
Sample Date: 02/23/2022
Sample Approval Date: 02/25/2022
Go live date: 03/07/2022

Assessment Details (IS):
- Hours for development:   10 hours 
- Parallel required: (yes) 
- Setup archival files with following specification and copy to client pickup folder for  SSCU daily notice (DLA) 
- Create ONE pdf file for each notice type and zip up together (for the archival file)?

For example,
Inside SSCU_DLA_archived_MMDDYYY_segment.zip,
sscudl001.pdf
sscudl002.pdf
ssucdl003.pdf,.....

Per Gary this is waived due to "this is already covered in their contract .  Since the contract covers PDF retrieval for ALL applications this would be an internal work order not something they need to sign for or be charged for as a new application."

comment: Hi [~jun],

Can you pleaes provide the PDF archival specs below?
*Daily Notice*
*Document Filename Format*: <DOC TYPE>_<ACCT NUM>_<SEQUENCE>.PDF
SSCU_DLA_archived_MMDDYYY_segment.zip,
*Index Content Definitions (Fields Separated by a Pipe "|" ):*
*Document Filename Format:* sscudl001.pdf (ONE pdf file for each notice type and zip up together)
*Index File Name:* 
*Zip file Name:* SSCU_DLA_archived_MMDDYYY_segment.zip
Archival files will now be zipped in batches of 5,000 accounts. This is to standardize SSCU archival

Thanks, Barnett
