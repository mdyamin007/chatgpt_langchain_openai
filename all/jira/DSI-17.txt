Updated columns

comment: I have checked the insert issue.  It was happening because I was working with the onshore database. The code runs much faster it I run in in our local db. For the async. issue, I am working into it. Only callable future can be implemented in java 7. I will be working on it tomorrow.

Please find the code in i3 and pui code in ftp file named JIDA_17_12_APR_2019_SYM.zip.pgp. Although handling the async part is not working correctly, Database handling is working with the addition of the new columns. We are working on async issue and give you a solution asap.
