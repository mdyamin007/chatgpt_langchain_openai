title: 15823 / 47915 - FCBT - Enable eTaxes for all sub-CIDs
description: Add to hypercube code and test emails - added hypercube code

Note: blockEmail flag is currently enabled for etax. Need to remove that flag.

Infotrac email template

need to enable passphrase on infoservice pilot - added onto pilot



Might need to update the styles.css to change the tax statement link color.

comment: deployed hypercube code onto pilot, can view etaxes for cafc at least. Ran into email errors and also potential text coloring that I may have to change. Need to test all the other cids to see if it is the same case.

comment: The email passphrase for cafc and the other cids are not there in the notifyservice configs. Take it from Production. I think for notifyservice passphrase, we use the same value across all environments (since this is an internal passphrase)

comment: passphrase was added onto pilot, emails seem to work (at least for cafc). Had to pull taxes from production and post them onto pilot for most of the sub cids. SSO works for all of them on pilot, a few subcids have differing color schemes when comparing tax tab to the top menu buttons.

comment: Client wants to review both jef 47979 and 47915 at the same time, pushed out dates accordingly


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: Pending response from client about testing pilot, also tied with jef 47979.


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: Per Phoebe, client approved the updates on pilot. Needs to be released with Tai's FCBT updates too, so waiting on that.
