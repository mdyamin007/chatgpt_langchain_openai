title: 15674 / 47345 - UCCU - Update Enrollment Process
description: Background:
 UCCU is a one-to-one setup for us. However, Alkami is set up with them as a one-to-many. This affects us, since when a co-owner enrolls, that co-owner information may overwrite the original owner's information.

Solution:
 We'll use the enrollment process to write the original owner's name back in. The email address would be also be reassigned to the original owner's, but this is already existing logic.

--The client is using handler3/registrar3. I think it may be possible to move them to the standard handler/registrar and keep existing logic. Even if we have to modify the standard handler/registrar, the enhancement needed should be minimal.
