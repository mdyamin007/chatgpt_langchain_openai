title: Hypercube Pagination Refactoring
description: None


author: mamunur.rashid
comment: *Flag:* pageAccountLimit : 20 (by default it is 20 if the flag is not present)

*enrollPreference:* Data will be paginated according to the pageAccountLimit.

*dsoEnrollPreference:* Same as enrollPreference.

*Profile:* Same as enrollPreference.

*Account selector:* There will be a scrollbar if the number of accounts is more than the pageAccountLimit.

If the number of accounts is less than 20 (or less than pageAccountLimit) then pagination will not be applicable.

We will not support odd numbers as pageAccountLimit.

Test all the functionality in enrollment, dso enrollment, and profile page for byUfa, byUsr notification type. Also for bySelective paperless and non selective paperless. Test with only email, only sms and both sms and email.

Manunur, thank you for provided information,

I verified SSO pages for members with more then 20 accounts and less then 20 account and all look good.

For DSO page, I can't go through Account Preferences/Login Information step, I have error on Submit 'All fields are required', I fill up all fields, tried twice in IE and Chrome browsers

Thank you,

Natasha

Don't submit until the account and delivery preference boxes appear like the below image.

Also don't reload theAccount Preferences page. The account information and delivery preference box will disappear if you reload the page using the browser reload button.

Were you able to see the pagination on this page while testing? Currently, after [~tai.trinh]'s recent stage deployment pagination is not working.

Mamunur,

I see the page you gave example above, I did not reload, I don't see pagination on this page and after Submit I have same error '{color:#FF0000}All fields are required.{color}', even all fields are filled up.

Thank you,

Code is now up and running. Try again. I hope you can now pass through the Account Preferences/Login Information step.

Please try to finish testing as soon as possible. David told us to release it on production soon.

Thanks.

Mamunur, today I have message that user already enrolled, I can't use same data. I tried to login with my credential and it does not let me through. I was trying to sign up several times and had error, I don't exactly remember my login/password but I tried to recover password for all my user names I used to sign up and nothing working.

I always need to have file with data to test , to have more then one set.

Please provide me with credentials to login or more sets of data to sign up

Thank you,

Natasha

I verified for one of the provided account, Pagination is working correctly, I see it on enrollment step and on Profile tab.

I see scroll bar for accounts on home page.

On profile page I can't change delivery preferences preferences and Submit button is grey out - *please confirm this is OK* 

*Issue that needs to fix:*

'Forgot password' is not working, Email address field is missing on authentication check step

This is a pre-existing bug we have fixed on the pilot but has not been moved to production yet. We have discussed this with Tai and he said to release the pagination code and we have scheduled this bug fix on the next production release.
