title: SSCU - Submit button error on admin site
description: Upon clicking on the 'Submit' button on a user's account profile to switch their delivery preference/update email address, it directs to an error page titled HTTP Status 500 showing an error stacktrace. Attached screenshots of the submit button as well as the error page.

This is currently happening on both pilot and stage, so it's possible that it is happening on production too.

Note: This was coincidentally found internally, not by the client.

comment: HI [~Shun.Kuwashima]

I looked into the issue and found that SSCU uses a "pathway" api after updating the database with changed dp/np info. This pathway api is pointed to old menlo server infoservice. I found these old api links on Pilot and Stage web.xml. The production code is using the working brisbane api, so I think production is not getting affected with this issue.

I have updated the pilot and stage (trunk and production branch) for both admin and member site and did not get this error on Pilot. I am attaching an screenshot here (sscu_dp_update.png).

Let me know if anything is needed.

Thanks

Azad

comment: Thanks [~Azad], I tested on pilot as well and on stage after deploying it, looks good. I'll close this out.
