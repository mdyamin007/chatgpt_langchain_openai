title: FCBT - [26898][pvt] Replacing Logo and Color Matching: AGFC
description: Total 20 IS hrs - 5hrs for each sub CID (another 6hrs if we have to modify data files)

4 ISD hours to export and test.



I believe we can have 3 IS JIRAs for 3 IS programmers.



**UPDATE 8/11/2022** WE WILL ONLY BE WORKING ON AGFC UNTIL WE RECIEVE TEST FILES FOR THE OTHER ASSOCIATIONS

1.There are no production files for all subCIDs except AGFC Simple Statement and Funds Held. Can we get data files from client or else we have to use CTFC data files to modify for these subCIDs.*If we have to modify CTFC data files to use, it will be extra 6 hours.*

2. Will we be using psegs or tiff for these logos. For CTFC, we have to use tiffs to match the colors. Or do we have to test for both to see which matches the colors best?



Samples will be approved by Melisa Atkinson at FCBT - we will need to ship physical copies. 1 application set per CID is fine (not all applications need to be shipped).
