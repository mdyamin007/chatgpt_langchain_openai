comment: Hi [~phoebe.george],

1. I can take of this, will provide another update at eod when it's complete. Btw, do we want automatic emails for any of these apps or should they remain on a manual trigger for now?
2. I assume this is the Accumulative Paperless Report that we used to have scheduled for them. How often and what time should the report be generated and sent over? Also this report has dp@sfcu.org listed for confirmation emails, is this fine to keep as is?

Just a recap what we discussed on the internal call:
 # Automatic emails should be enabled for eNotice and eCredit Cards; eStatements (monthly) will remain manual for email trigger for DP.
 # The 'ext enrollment file' should be processed and provided via FTP client_pickup b 5pm PST daily. The email notification used should remain the same as the original setup as: [dp@sfcu.org|mailto:dp@sfcu.org]

Thanks!

comment: [~phoebe.george] I've messaged you already about this, but just documenting that the following changes have been made:
* Emails for all applications are re-enabled now. Automatic trigger is enabled only for enotices and credit card.
* 'Ext enrollment file' is re-scheduled in and set to send out daily around 5pm PST. Email notification remains the same as: dp@sfcu.org
