comment: Hi [~phoebe.george], due date is passed, can we update it?

comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] We have a request to post this new application under a new tab, rather than the existing Mortgage tab. Sorry this had not been caught sooner!

How difficult and/or how much timeframe would be needed to post this Loan Bill applications to a new tab instead called: Loan Bill

It would then require it's own email content as well.

Thank you,

Phoebe

comment: Hi [~phoebe.george], I believe a new app setup would be around 3 hours, so I would need some extra time to setup all the configurations. I can probably get it on pilot by eod tomorrow assuming I have time, but if not, then definitely sometime this week. I'll let you know when I have it ready for you on pilot.

comment: Loan tab is deployed onto pilot and index file ml4_20220411_1_20220421_0709_sscu.txt is also posted.

comment: [~phoebe.george] In addition, I've attached screenshots of the pilot member site and admin site. Fyi for their member site only, currently all their statements (minus enotice and etax) are under the estatement tab as shown in the attached image sscu_loan_sso_pilot.PNG while the admin site has separate tabs. Let me know if this is fine, and I can proceed to move these updates to stage.

comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] checking with CU now. Thanks!

comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] I talked with SSCU and they are ok with the information displaying as you noted on the SSO/Member Site versus the Admin Site - they are expecting that display/header. HOWEVER, they are asking for a change now to the header/description itself from 'Loan Bill' to: Loan Statement

They are aware that adding 'Loan Statement' won't make it consistent with the other products/applications, but have made the decision to make this change.

Sorry for the back and forth. Every time I get an approval, there is another contact at the CU that chimes in on the request. This is their FINAL update and good to move forward changing 'Loan Bill' to: Loan Statement

Thanks,

Phoebe

comment: Hi [~phoebe.george], I've updated Loan Bill to Loan Statement on pilot and attached updated screenshots. I'll work on moving it to stage tomorrow.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] Can't thank you enough for this last minute request! Screenshots are approved. Thank you!


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~Igor.Khosid] SSCU requested a last minute change to update the tab name for this application to 'Loan Statements' instead (from Loan Bill). Shun was able to quick make the update yesterday and customer approved it. The screenshots are attached. Please let me know if this is needed to go through QA again. If okay to proceed with the parallel test/release, I will have it verified by client in production directly after the first cycle is posted for confirmation (as they are aware this was a rush request). 

Thank you,

Phoebe
