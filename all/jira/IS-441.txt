Here's the sample for hsa and ira.. I've generated it from local.
Thanks

comment: Thanks, samples have been forwarded to customer with the questions we discussed on the call today. Thanks!


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~fahad] Smartsheet has been updated with the feedback and confirmation on questions from the customer; SOW has been updated with the changes.

Please confirm when you can provide an updated sample set, as well as provide the eStatement index file for posting. Thanks!




author: JIRAUSER10910
comment: Hi [~phoebe.george],
[^STARTX_HSA_2.pdf][^STARTX_IRA_2.pdf]
I've attached the updated sample.

thanks.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~fahad] Thank you! Samples have been sent to customer for final approval. The eStmt index files are actually due today for ISD, but we can review on our upcoming call this morning for any questions first.


author: JIRAUSER10910
comment: Hi [~phoebe.george],
I'll be able to provide the eStmt Index on 17th December.
Thanks.

comment: [~fahad] DSI-ISD tried to post these two index files and noted the following:

 _I just checked and found the ys1 and ys2 files are also on doc format. Those are needed to be on ETaxData3 format too._

Can you confirm if you know how this update should be made and how soon? Thanks!


author: JIRAUSER10910
comment: Hi [~phoebe.george],

I've talked with DSI-ISD team. There was some misunderstanding. Everything is ok now.
thanks.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~fahad] DSI said the HSA posted to pilot, but the IRA had an issue with the date format? Any chance this can be fixed today? I need to get this onto pilot as we are just a bit behind schedule - here is his feedback from the ISD story:

ys2(HSA) is posted in pilot.

Also, ys1(IRA) has wrong date format (MMddyy). Doc supports yyyyMMdd format. Please update.





Thanks!


author: JIRAUSER10910
comment: Hi [~phoebe.george],
I've fixed the issue and re-generated the index file.

comment: [~phoebe.george]: Looks like this project is still work in progress and have not received approvals. Looks like we will not make 12/31/2021 live date. We will need to discuss a revised live date next week.






author: phoebe.george
comment: [~William.Kong] The live date is 1/24/22, timeline smartsheet was added to the story and epic. due dates have been updated.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~fahad] STAR has approved their PRINT samples. As mentioned in the zoom chat, STAR has decided to only move forward with PRINT setup for January production. They are still testing electronic with their online banking vendor in pilot, but they feel they will not have enough time to fully validate electronic testing. They have decided for this January production launch to just go live with print and mail for all customer, so we will not be using a paperless file as well. Please let me know your next steps to move forward with print only. If you are able to provide a DPVS for samples, I can have these printed in preparation for QA. Thank you!


author: william.kong
comment: [~phoebe.george]: There is still several coding components [~fahad]needs to work on. [~fahad]is shooting for Wednesday, 1/12/2022 to complete the script to provide to QA. With Igor being super busy, can you please confirm if with him his schedule so that we can plan parallel for Print ONLY.



As for eStatements, will this be released in Feb/March? If so, can you create another story for this portion of this project so that we do not lose sight of it. We can just add it to under your EPIC that you have already here.

comment: [~fahad] DPVS's were received and printed in TX and will be forwarded to QA. I had DP convert the print files from the DPVS's to PDF's and sent to STAR for final approval based on the current 2021 data (since we tested using 2020 data previously for the STAR samples). As soon as this is approved, we can prepare for QA. Just a reminder that these forms need to be mailed by 1/31 at latest. The files used to produce the DPVS's are true production files. Thank you!


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~fahad] I had our Data Center convert the DPVS print samples to PDF and sent to STAR for review. Please see attached screenshots from the IRA samples missing verbiage - can you update and provide final samples? These are from the production files. Thanks!

HSA Samples are APPROVED.

However, the latest IRA samples are still missing some data, but on the subsequent pages - here is the issue reported below, with the screenshot of what is missing.

Can you correct and provide a new set of samples and DPVS?

comment: Hi [~phoebe.george],
 STAR_FMV_010622_0917_PROD
 Data file is supposed to contain IRA data only. But it seems there is HSA data in this file. That's why the missing part issue caused.
 So are they supposed to come mixed up?

Thanks.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~fahad] Here is the information from STAR with a confirmation of what is part of the files:



_File TN7660 = HSA Fair Market Value End of Year Balance Statements (Account type = D/Checking); these show all credits & debits on the HSA account for the tax year 2021._ 

INTERNAL: So the 'FMV' file will include HSA accounts only.

_File CD6600 = IRA Fair Market Value statements and will include HSA CDs (Time Deposits). The plan type on these are HSA but they are a CD. The rest in this file are for IRA CDs._

INTERNAL: This file can include both types.



Both files have the words Fair Market Value printed on the statements because they truly are FMVs for Deposit HSAs (TN7660) and Time Deposit IRAs & HSA CDs (CD6600).

comment: [~fahad]: Please review this and advise what is your solution to get around this issue. I did review the original data file:CD6600P_14-58-28-1933055.txt and client is right. I do see the Health Savings (i.e. HSA) in this testfile.


author: JIRAUSER10910
comment: Hi [~William.Kong],
 You are right. I also saw it yesterday. We missed it. As HSA and IRA 2 different app, it never crossed my mind to search for one data in another app's data file. I just searched through different types of IRA in the data for anchor purpose.
 And I already made 2 different script for 2 different app. If we can have separated data file for HSA and IRA , I won't have to do any code. As discussed with [~phoebe.george], this data is generated from JH Core, Can you look into it if we can have separated data file for those app? If not, then I think creating preprocessing script to separate them would be better and faster now. But will this job run in Cron? If not then we can run the preprocessing script manually first then we will have the 2 different data file to run the processing script. In that way I don't have to work on update that much. I think so. Still I would discuss with [~rony] if it can be done in any better way.
 Thanks.

comment: [~fahad]: I'm pending a status update on your progress as requested from our meeting yesterday. Please advise status on how much was accomplished after our meeting today so that [~phoebe.george]and I are aware. Are you at 80%, 90%, 95%.? Is there any road blocks?



Please advise.

Hi [~William.Kong],
I'm signing off for today now. My progress is all controls files are done.. insert files are done.. also 40% script is done. I'll also start working tomorrow. So I'll provide another update tomorrow when I sign off for tomorrow.

Wait, Let me generate and provide the dpvs's again for both hsa and ira. It will take 30 min at most. Then request print samples.
