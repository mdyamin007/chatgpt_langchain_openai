Since the major change is in the scripts, I need yourhelp. Could you please run the process of splitting files on some test data and give me the results, preferably so that the input and the output states could be seen?

I viewed the script and I have understanding of what it does, but I'm afraid that's not enough.

comment: Hi [~avannik]

Here is an test data example.

The xref file is:[^ivbk_xref_acct_09122022_080001.txt]

The xref file contains the ivbk account numbers.

The main data files are:

[^1342.0909.1438171.CK_NSFNT.STM]

[^1342.0909.1438369.TD_NOTE.STM]

[^1342.0909.1438495.DP-OVDFT.STM]

After theextractIVBKAccounts.py is run:

the CAMB Files will be:

[^camb_1342.0909.1438171.CK_NSFNT.STM]

[^camb_1342.0909.1438369.TD_NOTE.STM]

[^camb_1342.0909.1438495.DP-OVDFT.STM]



The IVBK Files will be:

[^ivbk_1342.0909.1438495.DP-OVDFT.STM]

[^ivbk_1342.0909.1438171.CK_NSFNT.STM]

[^ivbk_1342.0909.1438369.TD_NOTE.STM]



For example the account number10423507 is in the xref file, the account also exist in 1342.0909.1438171.CK_NSFNT.STM file, so the account containing account number10423507 will be extracted to ivbk_1342.0909.1438171.CK_NSFNT.STM file. The camb data files will contain those accounts other than the ivbk ones.

comment: Thank you [~tohidulI], I got it.

As there are changes to IVBKDL001.dfa,IVBKDL003.dfa, andIVBKDL006.dfa, please request print samples. Thanks!

comment: Hi [~phoebe.george]

can you have isd to enable auto trigger for this file pattern *"ivbk_1342.\d\{4}.\d\{7}.(CK_NSFNT|TD_NOTE|DP-OVDFT).STM.pgp"*?

Do we have any specifications on how these notices will be sent? Envelopes, endorsement? I see no SOW for IVBK.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~avannik] IVBK is setup for eNotice only; no print will be generated due to paperless file; as these are flagged as digital notices. That is why there is no SOW. Thanks!


author: JIRAUSER11700
comment: [~phoebe.george]my bad - I looked at the samples and got confused.

I saw no issues, QA passed.

comment: [~Peter.Dang] [~TunA] The CRON/split file test worked tied to #34351. Can you assist with this code release this morning based on the transfer form from Tohid in previous comment? I want to start processing production files that have been held as soon as possible.

Thanks,
