title: FTP Scanner Global Handler
description: Create global handler that support file decryption and P-UI triggering. File regular expression will be reading from database instead so this will eliminate the need to create new Handler for every client and no more code deployment.

- Enhance FTS interface so that we can utilize the same file patter and also include the eStatement Job type, 'AUTH, AFP, ECL, etc.';
