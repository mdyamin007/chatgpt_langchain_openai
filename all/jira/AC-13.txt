title: TKCU- FICS Mortgage Staetment Validation Count  Update TEST 20083
description: IS Turnover: 5/5/2021

Programming Hours: 20

Description of Work:

Update the global /home/master/redtitan_csv_index.pl to add additional validation logic to compare the PDF image count with the AFP image count. Please the /home/util/afp_total_page.pl If output does not match, exit out of the program and alert DP. Also add logic to send warning email to IS to alert any client script that is not compatible to verify the AFP image count so that we can create additional projects to get them retrofitted and fixed.

Email Template [#1|https://track.infoimageinc.com/issues/1]:
 # Send WARNING email to IS team that this program afp file cannot be determined. Use maillist internal list with is@infoimageinc.com
 # Do NOT exit out of program; We will gradually fix each one when email come out to us. #
 # SUBJECT: RedTitan PDF Image Count vs AFP Image Count Logic Not Working. #
 # Hi IS, #
 # This is a warning email to alert you that this RedTitan program cannot locate the afp file to verify counts.
 # The RedTitan CSV file is located in $ARGV^[0|https://app.na3.teamsupport.com/vcr/183/Pages/TicketV2.html?TicketNumber=19686#fn0]^. Please update the processing script to place the AFP file into this
 # location so that we can verify the total page of the PDF matches with the total number of pages in AFP. #
 # Please note the program did not exit and continued normally. We may need to verify with DP that the PDF counts matches
 # AFP counts until we get this logic fixed.

Email Template #2:
 # RECIPIENT: DP@infoimageinc.com (Use /home/keep/internal list maillist logic)
 # SUBJECT: Error: RedTitan PDF Image Count vs AFP Image Count Does Not Match.
 # Hi DP, #
 # There was a processing error verify total number of PDF page counts vs AFP page count.
 # Expected PDF page count is: $....
 # The $p_dir/$afpfilename returned a page count of $..... #
 # Please contact IS Department to research why there is a discrepancy.

Hi Jessica: If I understand correctly, you need to create a story and assign to me ( per Joe in today meeting). So I assigned this epic back to you. Please create a story for me instead??

Thanks
