comment: [~lemoy28]: Per clarification our conversation, you are trying to test afpcompare. So you need to login into any Menlo Park server and run the command you shared in SparK:



scp oper1@10.4.20.40:/z/apcu/apcums2131.afp /d/iss/le/

I'm marking this ticket as Done since this is a non-issue.
