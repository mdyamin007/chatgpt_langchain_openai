description: Replace current loan bill backers on all three loan bill types (MTG, LOC and CNS)

comment: [~jharvey]: We need the back resources for this project. Can client or Wilson provide the resources for back in TIFF 300DPi Reslution.



[~rony]: This ALCU project live date is the same as the other ALCU Return Mail project. Can you also assign Ruman and Shifah to work on this. This would give them experience in converting TIFF to PSEG.



[~TunA]: FYI
