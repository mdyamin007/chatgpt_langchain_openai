title: FLCU - StmtPDFi Conversion to AFP2PDF Python [InHse]
description: Update existing processing script to no longer use PDFi tool to create pdf.
 Instead use afp2pdf.py program with index_build_multicore option for ALL statement related apps.
 The smaller daily notice jobs can use the current index_build options.

All the zip file, pgp encryption, index file contents, and PDF file naming convention must remain exactly the same original specifications.

Please ensure the standard SOP on the directory structure must be followed: 
 ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/pdf, ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/zip, ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/work is followed.
 Also, clear the folder directory folder before each processing. We do NOT want to accumulate previous runs.

The current program should support checking total PDF counts verification to make sure the expected pdf matches the total number for pdfs generated; If not, incorporate this standard verification logic

DT_JOB_ID:
 133565-C00.01-V20541

Processing Scripts to modify:
 flcu_stmt_process.sh

Data Files to use:
 FLCU_STMT_043021.zip.pgp



*NOTE:*

This applications runs on RH2, so testing will be performed on RHS for all job_sel options.

/z/dsi_pdfi_testing/flcums1/new has zip files after update.

/z/dsi_pdfi_testing/flcums1/old has zip files with production code.

comment: [~rony]: Comparison failed. There is a vertical line shifting issue for FLCU. Please see attached document (diff_05312022_9587841_73343.pdf.pdf).

This was a similar problem we had for ELCU in the May 31, 2022 cycle. Nothing was changed and we just waited for the June 30, 2022 cycle production cycle to run and the vertical line issue disappeared.



I wonder if this is the same situation, can you re-run FLCU MS1 cycle 6/30/2022 in parallel again on the RHS server? I'll back-up the production version for now. Please ensure the message manager is the same in parallel before re-running cycle 6/30 in parallel. Le told me as long as InfoTRAC Stage Message Manager does not have an existing campaign, then the parallel processing will pull the production message.

processing done . It's in /z/pdf_afp/flcu/flcums1/zip/ folder.

Thanks

comment: [~rony]: Much better. Weird, my assumption was right. Looks like the vertical line spacing issue is gone after re-running a more current cycle.



[~Igor.Khosid]: I've ran the pdf_compare.pl utility to compare. I had to tweak the pixel setting from 5 to 8 to get zero differences. Because of the image / psegs, I had to increase the pixel tolerance level. I've took the liberty to scan more files. Instead of 6,000, i went up to 10,000.

comment: [~rony]: Sorry to do this. I noticed that print & estmt step was not ran in on RHS parallel. Can you run it just to make sure there is no issue. We need to do afpcompare to make sure it is ok.
