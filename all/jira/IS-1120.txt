comment: Per [~Natalie.Tom]'s and [~TunA]'supdate, Ruman has another URGENT project related to this application that he needs to fix. Per [~TunA]'s understanding, Ruman wants to merge his urgent fix along with this project. Please take Ruman's version from parallel and remove the TIFF.


author: william.kong
comment: [~phoebe.george]: Because the Visa cycles once a month around the 20th, then we cannot include this project along with Ruman's urgent release in [https://app.na3.teamsupport.com/?TicketNumber=29661] (TS# 29661).



This project Natalie is working on is still going through sample process. In short, this project live date of 6/24 will need to be delay a week or so. If there is any questions or concerns, please let us know.

comment: Hi [~phoebe.george], We still have issue for TIFF logo and color "Credit Card Statement" TIFF image in subsequence pages. I just spoke to Ernest. He suggest to update eform for second page too. So the logo color will be matched for first page and subsequence pages. Can you please request Wilson for second page preprint PDF to setup eform too? *Please let Natalie knows as soon as possible. So she can replace eform for both pages.*

As [~William.Kong]mentioned above,this project live date of 6/24 will need to be delay a week or so.



Hi [~Natalie.Tom]: As we discussed, please work with [~rumanb] for replacing his codes for TS 29661 in parallel (without eform update).



Thanks,

Tun




author: phoebe.george
comment: [~William.Kong] [~TunA] I will request Wilson to make the second page an e-form and submit to Natalie. 

To recap, Ruman's bug fix will be released first (this week). Once live, Natalie will continue with her update and we will reset the live date for this story to 7/1, or later.

I'll have Wilson work on the second page e-form in the meantime.


author: william.kong
comment: [~phoebe.george]: I've updated live date to 7/1. Once Wilson has the updated e-form, please contact Natalie


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~Natalie.Tom]Here is the new e-form. The page 2 for VISA will be assigned a new stock code called 3718. I am updating the SOW with the new page 2 stock code.

I have attached here.

author: phoebe.george
comment: [~Natalie.Tom] Samples are APPROVED. Please confirm target new live date and if possible to complete for 7/18 at latest.

[~Juliana Vannik] Sorry, I forgot to notify you this morning when we discussed the other projects. This is good to move forward.

comment: In Papyrus (Project file: /d/iss/qa/SSCU/SSCUCC11_ISJIRA_1120.zip)
The statement looks good - removed logos and "Credit Card Statement":
 !scr_Papyrus.png|thumbnail! 

However, in Print samples, Admin site, and SSO member site - logos and "Credit Card Statement" still have not been removed.

Please check with ISD on what needs to be done on the IS side


author: eric.yan
comment: [~Natalie.Tom]

How was the logo removed? Is a new resource used or removing existing resource.

Please provide the new resource if applicable.

Or check if the dfa if all logo resource is updated.

The print sample not updated implies the dfa is not updated for all conditions.

[~Andrey.Kutsenko]FYI.

comment: [~eric.yan]

I didn't remove the logo. For the 'f' option, the logo isSSCUCCLC.TIF and the"Credit Card Statement" isSSCUCCSC.TIF.

[~Andrey.Kutsenko]FYI


author: eric.yan
comment: [~Andrey.Kutsenko],

This is an eform update, so instead of embedded logo, we print it from the eform with improved color management.

So on the print side, Pyparus won't have the logo anymore since it's not embedded. But the print sample should still have it.

For the e side, as long as there's no verbiage change (different logo, text etc), I don't think there's any update that needs to be done.

[~Natalie.Tom], please correct me if I'm wrong.


author: JIRAUSER11104
comment: Hi [~Natalie.Tom], [~eric.yan], any update?

[~eric.yan]'s comment is correct.

From your comment in the masterparallel ticket, "Could you move forward with the code release when ready, please?", I wanted to confirm if you wanted to release the code early since the live date for this application isn't until 7/18.


author: JIRAUSER11300
comment: Hi [~Natalie.Tom] ,

Yes, sooner is fine. The next production VISA file arrives 7/18, which is why we set the live date for that. However, it only cycles once per month, so earlier is fine as well. 
Thanks!
Juliana

Code has been released. Backup ID:20220713153445


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~Natalie.Tom] The VISA production file for SSCU was processed yesterday. In checking the Job Status, the logo is not displaying (from the e-form). Can you check and provide an update and confirm if we need to reprocess once updated?

[~TunA] [~Juliana Vannik] FYI


author: tuna
comment: Hi [~phoebe.george],

When we use eform, we cannot see logo in infoTrac Job Status. That is normal. Only if we use TIFF logo pulling from format program.

Please provide physical sample to approval.

Thanks
