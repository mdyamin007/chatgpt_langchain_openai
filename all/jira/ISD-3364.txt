What is the latest status on this? I think due to this being a standalone kind of update, we should be able to proceed on this and release it whenever it is done. We'll have to coordinate with Anil on InfoTRAC deployment, of course.

Thanks,
Tai

we need to review this on the API end whether it is doable or not.

[~surekha.dani] would you please help us evaluating if it can be done or not ?
