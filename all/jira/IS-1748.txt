"In reviewing the samples, I found a discrepancy in the last paragraph. The year should reflect2023 instead of 2021. This is data that is already included in the datafile.

In addition, and referring to the section highlighted in blue, we have a total of two variations:
 * *Cashier's Check for more than two years*
 * *check for payroll or wages for more than six months*

The samples provided do not include any payroll examples. Please see below for mapping inf

     24 PP1="4000"
     25 PP2="4005"
     26 PP3="4006"

     28 ENV1="4401"
