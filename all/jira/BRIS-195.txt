author: kent.chan
comment: Will- It appears that all tasks above are complete. DNS has been fixed, access lists are in place, and Hesham has cloned the server per your instructions. PLease close the ticket if this is complete.


author: william.kong
comment: [~kent.chan]: I'm able to ssh into the system. Both system has the exact same hostname. But i can work through it since these two servers are temporary. I'll close it out after i get the samba configured for David's servers. His servers needs CIFS access to these two boxes:

comment: [~davidt]: Can you test secure4 and secure5 and see if can access / view the share folders. Also note, the secure4 and secure5 DNS are updated in Brisbane side by Kent.

comment: [~kent.chan] and [~premraj.patil]: The NFS ports are not opened? Did you guys copyand +*append*+ the fw setting that you current have of 10.4.10.10 to 10.4.10.58 and 10.4.10.205? Afterward, you can delete the fw setting of 10.4.10.10.



If you deleted the fw settings for 10.4.10.10, then here were the servers the needed port nfs port access:

ca-isis-pr-##

ca-preproc-pr-##



Per David: port 445 needs to be opened as well.

10.4.20.35


author: kent.chan
comment: Dave- CIFS from ftpbu to the ftp servers is working now, somehow the rule didn't save when I edited the rule for some reason earlier



Will- The NFS ports are open between the ca-isis-pr and ca-preproc-pr servers and ca-s*ftp-pr servers.

comment: [~kent.chan] and [~premraj.patil]: Port 111 is not opened. Can you open this RPC port too? NFS requires this port 111 also to be opened.


author: hesham.hanna
comment: Those are the names and the ip's

ca-s4ftp-pr-01.infoimageinc.com [10.4.10.58]

ca-s5ftp-pr-01.infoimageinc.com [10.4.10.205]


author: william.kong
comment: [~kent.chan]: Per Prem. Since this is a DMZ firewall setting, can you please open up RPC port 111 in order for NFS port to work? Thanks!



Also I cannot ssh into these two servers10.8.11.205 from ca-isis-pr-03:

author: kent.chan
comment: Will- port 111 is open for both s4 and s5 FTP servers (did not need to make changes):

!image-2020-10-02-15-26-24-799.png!

Port 22 is NOW open for s4 and s5 servers

!image-2020-10-02-15-27-24-762.png!

The only access port not open for the ftp servers is RDP and you do not need it from the sources you specified.

Why do you need to connect to these servers from BB?


author: william.kong
comment: [~kent.chan]: ssh access is a one time deal so that I can help configure the folders (i.e. create NFS & CIFS access); Normally you guys own these servers to configure ftp services, create ftp accounts, update nfs / cifs access etc...;

comment: [~kent.chan]: My bad sorry! I had the headache with the comment above!!! I did not realize i put a screenshot of menlo ip address. Per our conversation, everything is good.

i will check and inform David to test after I made the last edit on this secure5 temp server.


author: trang809
comment: Ok, I am able to access this now on FTPBU. Will have the team test other VM.
