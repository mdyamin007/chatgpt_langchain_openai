Attached new samples to match what is displayed currently in production for PRINT, minus the OMR, 2D, IMB [^snfb_heloc_samples_rev2.pdf]. Compared to previous samples, this sample differs in that the logo seen on page 3 of these new samples is present only on the back of the duplex pages (e.g. page 3, 5, 7, etc.) I have added additional text in the 'Loan Activity' for the first account to produce a dummy page 3.

Note that this new sample reflects the updates made according to answers provided by Black Knight to some of my questions. However, it does not yet contain updates to questions Black Knight/Guardian have yet to answer (e.g. recoverable corporate advances, payment reversals logic, etc.)

comment: [~SamV2021] - Hi Sam, per our client call today, they do not want 3 hole punch paper. Please update the recipe codes for both trays 1 and 2 and update the stock # for tray 2. I have updated the SOW per below. Please provide a new dpvs so I can send them and QA correct physical samples.

Hi Andrea! As requested, I have changed the recipe code programmed for stock code 3580 to be 04. Tray 2 now uses stock code 4000, which already has recipe code 00.

Please see my updated comments above for the new dpvs and print sample information.

I received the print samples,

on the heavies, the first cover page shouldn't have the backer on the back side, can we remove it or print it on 4000?

the first page is printed on 3580- it's correct

and all subsequent pages should be printed on 4000 and they'reprinted on 4001, please fix it, and attach a new dpvs.

[~andreav]-FYI

Hi Alis, it is by default that the cover page for heavies uses the same stock code as the first page. This should be a non-issue, but if the client specifically does not want the backer to be present on the heavy cover sheet, then we can revisit this item. We have mailed out print samples for them to review.

Regarding how the subsequent pages show stock code 4001 when they should be 4000, it appears that the wrong afp was printed out by ops.

By the way, were print samples provided for non-heavies?

[~andreav]

Please have ops print out the following afps corresponding to PROC ID 708929:
 * Parallel Environment
 * DPVS:[^snfbme4106_dpvs.pdf]
 * FILENAME1: snfbme41064.2o1.afp
 * IMAGE RANGE1: 1-16
 * FILENAME2: snfbme41065.hvy.afp
 * IMAGE RANGE2: 1-15
 * TRAY 1 STOCK: 3580
 * TRAY 2 STOCK: 4000

comment: [~SamV2021] - Client requested the following updates, please let me know when you can provide new samples for approval. 
# Replace logo beneath remittance and return address with the one on the top left of page but in black and white.
# Change CRE to form 5223
# Update eform to revised version from Wilson. (Address changed on back to Guardian PO Box instead of Sunflower) I will attach to ticket as soon as Wilson provides.

comment: [~SamV2021] - Attached is the new eform and black and white logo to use under the remittance. Please also replace black and white logo on any subpages that have it.

As requested, the following changes have been made:
 # The logo beneath the remittance, along with the logo appearing on the top right of odd pages (starting from page 3), have been replaced.
 # Configured new e-form designated for stock code 3727 using the approved pdf provided by Wilson.
 # Configured stock code 3727 to use recipe code 04.

Changing the CRE to form 5223 is something that I do not have control over. The program is just set up to, for select account, pull from insert bin 1. I believe that's something handled by PC or Ops?

Attached new DPVS. Please request new print samples:
 * Parallel Environment
 * DPVS:[^snfbme4106_dpvs_rev2.pdf]
 * FILENAME1: snfbme41064.2o1.afp
 * IMAGE RANGE1: 1-16
 * FILENAME2: snfbme41065.hvy.afp
 * IMAGE RANGE2: 1-15
 * TRAY 1 STOCK: 3727
 * TRAY 2 STOCK: 4000
