comment: [~barnetts] This is for eStatement, but there's no assessment from the eSide and no ISD hours.

I am following up on this ticket.

Thanks, Barnett

comment: [~barnetts] I don't see any ISD assessment for this, so not sure if this has been asked yet. Do they want MH mortgage statements to have its own tab/email template or combined under an existing one? Internally we already have a mortgage stmt type which is tied to 'Home Loan Statements' on the customer site, but it has the name 'Mortgage' on InfoTRAC. Depending on their request, this changes how many hours we need.

comment: Hi [~Shun.Kuwashima],

Please see SSCU question below. 
* Per SSCU, 
* If we add it to the mortgage statement tab, can it have it's own email template? Also, we would need it to have it's own Doc Code for the API call for Lumin (our digital banking provider) with a description of MH Loan Statement. 

Thanks, Barnett

comment: [~barnetts],

* Tabs and email templates go hand-in-hand. If we add it to the mortgage tab, then it will use the mortgage email template. It will need to be under a new tab in order to have its own email template.
* In relation to the above, we will probably need to have it post under its own tab so that it has its own doc code.

comment: Hi [~Shun.Kuwashima]

Per SANA,
We would like to proceed with adding a new tab and creating a doc code specific for the MH Loan. Please let us know what we need to do to proceed. 

Thanks, Barnett 


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~barnetts] Thanks, in that case please add 3 hours to the Estimated section on the right side. 

[~eric.yan] Please proceed with setting up a new tab for this new app. Make sure to add it to the doc_desc table as well for API.

Thanks!

comment: [~Andrey.Kutsenko] Eric is the one assigned to this, so he will let you know. I assume it still needs to go through client pilot approval as well before getting moved to stage.

I'll provide the sample to the client on pilot first by 11/11, and push the code to the stage for QA testing after client approval.

comment: Hi [~eric.yan], can I try testing on Stage?

comment: [~Andrey.Kutsenko]

I've not setup on stage yet, I wanna wait until the client approves.

SANA is not able to see MH Mortgage statements posted electronically; see job ID 139534-C28.01-V22900. Can you please provide them some account numbers to check. 
Also, they need the application added to the email notifications so we can create the template . 

Thanks, Barnett

1) The estmt job tracking wasn't enabled so it's not showing in job status. PC need to enable it and reprocess if that's desired. For now, the client could view samples in the account management tab.

sample account nubmers:

87177792
87233656
87178360
87178416


2) "MH Mortgage" email template option is added now.

comment: Hi [~eric.yan]

Please see SANA comment below:
I see the sample MH Mortgage statements in Account Management pilot portal for the account numbers provided however our records do not indicate that these members are enrolled in electronic statements. Can you find out what logic they used to post these? 

Also, I do not see the email template in the pilot InfoTack portal. 

Thanks, Barnett

comment: Hi [~barnetts],

1) The "Account Management" is used by the admin. The customer still needs to enroll to have access to online estatements. All estatements are posted so that they are available if the customer enrolls later.

2)

An email template needs to be created for MH Mortgage before activation.
