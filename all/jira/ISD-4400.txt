title: SEFC - Hypercube - ssoExchange Error Message
description: At the ssoExchange step, if somehow the account list is empty, we will get a 500 error (undefined). We'll need to detect that the account list is empty and display a different message and have it be configurable by cid.

To reproduce the error, use the Alkami Primary user sso connection on the Test Page. You will need to get a new data string. Then, change the MemberNumber and AcctNumber to bogus accounts that the CIF doesn't have access to (via the ext_id_mapping table). At the sso step, we will encounter the error.

SEFC is requesting this verbiage

IMPORTANT: We are unable to identify any statement accounts that you are authorized to view.This can occur if your membership is less than one business day old or if you are business account sub user who has not been granted access to a statement account.

Please let me know the overall effort and if there are any challenges.

I am adding a screenshot below for confirmation. Let me know if this is okay.

This will take 2days with testing. I will start working once you confirmed.

Thanks,

I was thinking that we still keep a majority of the "look" of that page. So the Error at the top. Then instead of "undefined" we would use the "error message" we define in the properties file.

Is this being done with an HTML template page that gets injected with a public resource from the client like the disclosure pages?

Thanks,
Tai

I am not using any template page. Just showing theerror messageas the previous undefined error based on the new error text flag and empty acctList logic. This way it will look more like the previous page.

I have updated the view as below. Take a look and let me know.

Thanks,
Sadman
