All the exceptions were due to "Missing Application Type", for example,

The application type is expected on field #10

comment: Hi [~eric.yan],

For letter 008 there is a requirement to read a CIF/control file and need to check for the customer account number in that cif file.

Ifaccount number is not found in cif file the dfa program was keeping the Application Type empty.

As you said, "The application type is expected on field #10" , i put a logic in dfa to print "DL" in such case if account number doesn't matches with CIF file.

I reprocessed the script today in parallel.

ISD index file name:dla_20220614_1_20220713_0520_bkpl.txt

Please check if this ISD index is good to go.

Thanks
