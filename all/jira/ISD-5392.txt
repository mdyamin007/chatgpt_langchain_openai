comment: Hi [~phoebe.george],

I made the requested verbiage changes and updated the logo on pilot, I've added screenshots to this ticket. One thing I would like to note about the logo is that the one existing on our system is a PNG file that is 260 x 59.79. Therefore I had to alter the image provided by the client and so the trademark symbol does look a bit small/blurry. Can you confirm with the client if the logo looks ok? If not, then please have them provide a logo file in PNG format and with dimensions near 260 x 59.79 (I think 260 x 60 should be just fine too).

Thanks,
Shun

comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] OSCU is trying to access their member pilot site directly through their pre-prod/test SSO environment - I provided them with the current pilot links, but they are getting an invalid/error message. Can you confirm if you can see any SSO logs with them trying to access and/or hitting our pilot site? Thanks!

comment: [~phoebe.george] are we still waiting for the client to approve on pilot? If so can we update the due date to a future wednesday?

To access, please use the diSSO Hypercube Stage page on the SSO test page and click on the stage button. You may have to change the Form URL to https://oscustage.infoimageinc.com/
