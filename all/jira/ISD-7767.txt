I have attached weekly report generated from pilot. There no mail pieces returned this week so there are no items listed in file. Ask customer if they are able to decrypt pgp report. Just want to make sure decryption works when we go live.

The client could not open the report sent.

comment: [~Kbittmann]I have emailed you new copy of report with different encryption key. Let me know if they are able to decrypt same.

Report sent to client. They tried to view report in Info Trac, however they said the link is not a hyper link so they are unable to open it. Please advise.

comment: [~Kbittmann]Audit report tab on infotrac shows information of reports generated. We cannot download anything from that. That's why I have sent copy of file via email. Also on pilot, I don't see any returned mail pieces, report file will be empty after decrypting the file. They can use "Return search" tab to search and export records. This is on-fly and they can do it anytime. Pilot does not have data so they cannot search anything.

Please client feedback below.

On the audit report tab under the return mail tab in Infotrac pilot will the report file names be a clickable link to open the file? They are not currently therefore I am unable to test if they will unencrypt upon opening.

In the meantime, can you send another test file via FTP. Once I receive this, our IT department will unencrypt and then I will take a look at the format and let you know if all looks good.

 # The return mail tab in infotrac is not clickable. The client won't need to get the file from FTP client pickup folder and unencrypt it.
 # The sample file is already in the client pickup folder./d/SECURE4/FTPRoot/wecu/client_pickup/weeklyReport_wecu_Return_mail_2022-10-05.pgp

I was able to manually added a return mail piece on pilot to simulate the situation.

Please advise the client to search for return mail on infotrac pilot, and the report will be able to download by clicking on the "export" button, in either flat or encrypted format.



This is an example of customized report generation, the weekly report will still be generated and placed in the client pickup folder (not the FTP folder).

The report name isweeklyReport_wecu_Return_mail_2022-10-21.pgp and it's in the client pickup folder.

The client pickup folder is the same folder where other reports are stored, like bounceback report.
