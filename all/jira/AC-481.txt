title: BKFN - [26481][pvt][in-house] Rate and Payment Notice Inquiry 
description: It was brought to my attention that we have any issue with the rate and payment notices. It appears that all the notices are appearing as a 1 YR CMT even though they are coded as something else, in the example below 1 YR LIBOR.



-------------------per Yamee-----------------------------

I have tested format_only.sh with and without the isis_version="717". When running without it, the statement is not showing what's in the data. When running with the newer version it is showing up correctly.



Will need an inhouse JEF to add the isis_version for your team to do a more thorough testing with qa verification before releasing to production.
