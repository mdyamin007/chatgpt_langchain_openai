Update your assigned daily letter DFA on the paper option light grey headers from 25% to 50%. Then have Ron test the print samples. If not dark enough, increase a bit more for more testing with Ron. When Ron says it is good, please assign to QA.

comment: [~jasonV]OPS noticed the heads don't match on the print samples from the other programmers, please see following from OPS:

please see DL 007 below. I believe the customer was going for the 50% shading on all sectional headers? Shouldn't the top header match the grayscale shading of the bottom one? If so, programmer should enter same grayscale values for both areas. All daily Ltrs recently submitted for test have the same issue as below. Please advise

Please ensure that the 1st section header matches the second section header (lighter shade).

Thanks
