This task is ready for QA testing in Staging.  You might take the following sequence of steps to test this.

1. Change email address and trigger email to yourself. 

2. From InfoTRAC, Click on Account Management tab.
    Search for user by account number or email address.
    In the "User Information" section, you may see a drop down list of user.  Choose the user that you want to remove.
    Click the trash icon to the right of the user name.  User Status would change to INACTIVE.  This user would no longer receive email for this account.
    If the user is associated with multiple accounts, search for the user via email and make sure that User Status is INACTIVE for all accounts.

3. Trigger the email again.  You should not receive email for the removed user.

Thanks.

Lin, I see 'Delete User' button, I don't see trash icon you mention above.

User is removing successfully after click on 'Delete User' button and status in changing to Inactive for this user.

I just checked InfoTRAC Stage.  The interface looks different from pilot.  That "Delete User" button is where the trash can is in pilot.  It should have the same functionality.

Verified Removing User feature on InfoTrac staging, works correctly

It is now live on production.

Please let the client know that only users with roles that has been granted "Access User Delete" permission will be able to do this.  Currently only IT-Admin role has this particular permission.

If the client wants us to enable this for other roles, please let us know.

Thanks.
