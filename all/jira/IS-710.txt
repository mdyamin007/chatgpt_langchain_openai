I've attached the*incomplete++*++utcu_mv2_xml.control. I would like to apply this to the existing mv2 program and the new program that I'm guessing that you will use mv3.

comment: Hi [~barnetts],

Here is a initial sample[^utcumv3.pdf]. I'll provide the full sample later.

In the mockup client asked to "Seperate & group transasctions based on card holders". But I don't see how we can do that based on the amount of information we have per tranasction. Can they elavorate on this.

Thanks,
Anwar

I can request UTCU for more information/ to make updates to the data. Can you please tell me and provide screenshots of what UTCU needs to do to make the  "Separate & group transactions based on card holders" easier/possible for you? 

Thanks, Barnett
