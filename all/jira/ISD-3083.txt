title: 13759 - BANB - PDF Captcha not showing during enrollment
description: Per client:

We previously were able to enroll into eStatements via Mobile. However, that is no longer working. This is occurring both via the Android and iOS Apps and Mobile Browser. I can get to the screen to view the Recaptcha Code but the Code does not display. Screenshots attached.

They also mentioned that this is only an issue on Mobile devices, occurring on all mobile browsers and for all users.



Note: I did some testing on pilot with an iPhone and seems to work just fine.

Attached screenshots from the client on what they see.
