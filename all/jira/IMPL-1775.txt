comment: Hi [~phoebe.george],

We need the client to make a decision on whether account number remapping is necessary when we post the statements ideally by the end of this week (10/8). Print team would need to get involved, so we need to know as soon as possible for IS to provide their assessments/assign resource.

Then, after that, the ideal case is that we will be gradually receiving pre-ingestion files over this course of this month. We can't meet the 11/5/21 due date if we can't start doing pre-ingestions within the next week or so.

Thanks,
Tai

comment: [~tai.trinh] and [~Ethan.Yu] they will have some re-mapping and will be providing a list of 40 accounts that will be needed.

I'll provide an update once received this week.

comment: Hi [~phoebe.george] ,

Then we will need IS help with reformatting the index files to remap the account numbers.


Thanks,
Tai

comment: [~tai.trinh] [~Ethan.Yu] SNFB confirmed that they will update the duplicate accounts in the index file before sending to us; no mapping needed on our end, and IS will not need to be involved.

Thanks!
