title: Hypercube - Remove ssoEnrollment flag implementaion and replace flag name for "ssoKeyGen.nt_hblogin"
description: All the hypercube client uses *ssoEnrollment* flag to remove account list from cookie because without this flag cookie token size became too large and it create issue while login.

As all the client uses this flag and also we do not need accunt list in token. So we are removing this flag implementation. Hence we won't beenable this flag for new client setup.



This*ssoEnrollment*flag is also used for"ssoKeyGen.nt_hblogin" auth to fetch user data from the database. Currently, no client uses this auth. We will use a new flag name for this auth.
