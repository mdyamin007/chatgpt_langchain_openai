comment: [~premraj.patil]: My mistake. I thought we added another dev temporary database based on our Tuesday meeting. I was wrong. 

I was able to work with Sean to connect to the other database after change configurations to use sid=dev instead of sid=wodb for the dev schemas.

I will close this high priority ticket now.
