comment: Hi [~kericapote],

I cannot assign this Story because we don't have deliveries for this project (like, latest PDF data file, file naming convention, etc.).

The timeline will depend on those information.

Thanks,

Tun

comment: Hey [~jun],

We forgot to discuss timeline for this setup.

When we get enough deliverables for setup from Enrico, please propose pose sample date and live date to Keri.

So that, she can adjust the timeline.

Thanks,

Tun

comment: Hi [~enricob], can you please provide me location of the test files when they're available?

comment: Hi Jun,

Just got off the call with the client. They changed their mind. They will be sending the collection letters in 1 big PDF file. I have requested a new test file that has the page number, and the y will be sending it tomorrow.



Thanks,



Enrico

comment: Hi Jun,



I just uploaded the new data file here.



Thanks,

comment: Hi [~enricob],

Will there be accounts with multiple pages? The previous batch of test files had accounts with multiple pages. If there is multiple pages then Redtitan will need to set up an anchor that is same position for every new account to capture the account correctly.


author: enricob
comment: I will double check with client, but there shouldn't be any multi-page Collection notices. For the anchor, there is a 1 in the top right corner which indicate page number.


author: jun
comment: [~enricob], After reviewing the test file, it doesn't look like there's any way to identify what letter it is in the big data file. These letters will be processed as one letter type. Would it better to switch back to individual files so that we can identify what letter it is or perhaps add a letter code somewhere in the data?


author: william.kong
comment: [~enricob]: Please ping me to discuss this. Looks like the input file scope work work has changed from individual pdfs to big pdf. Please refer to comment above as well for the logic to differentiate letters.






author: enricob
comment: New test file has been added. Client has included a letter code in the bottom left corner so we can track the letter type. I'm pending the letter code definition from the client.

author: william.kong
comment: [~enricob]: We are still pending the letter code table. I thought you had this spec from last week. Please check in with [~jun]on this.



[~kericapote]: What is the timeline for this project. When is final approval dates. According to this Jira ticket, the live date is next week (11/22).


author: enricob
comment: hi Jun,



Keri has updated the SOW with the letter code. Please look at the matrix at the end of the doc. She is still organizing the table but you should be able to get the client letter code from there.



Thanks,



Enrico

comment: [~kericapote]: Let's target 11/30/2021 to be the new revised live date. I'm going to update the Story here to be 11/30/2021. Once Jun completes that coding, we will share the revised sample date & approval date.



We+must+ go live by 11/30/2021. This project cannot go into December. [~jun]is assigned to Taxes next month and will be focused on that project.


author: william.kong
comment: [~kericapote]: Just a reminder. Live date is scheduled for 11/30/2021. We cannot go live in December. Please confirm approvals no later than EOD Tuesday. Jun is OOO between Thursday and will return on Tuesday. We need to initiate parallel ASAP so that QA & Parallel is initiated Wed & Friday of this week. Next target live date will have to be in February if date is missed.






author: kericapote
comment: [~William.Kong] the guy who needs to approve these is ooo today. He will be back and hopefully approve tomorrow. Can we release code first week of December? That is usually easier for IS and QA because it avoids the end of month bottle neck. Let me know.

Thanks!


author: william.kong
comment: [~kericapote]: I will just extend to no later than 12/9/2021. That's all I can agree to. Anything afterwards has a strong possibility that it will fall into February 2022.. For now, I will update the Due Date to be 12/9/2021 so that I don't get alarmed.*But*, please ensure you arrange with [~Igor.Khosid](QA) and OPS that they can squeeze in QA & Parallel to completed by 12/9/2021. Bear in mind, we are going through EOM.



[~jun]: FYI.

Keri - our initial agreement for testing 11/19 - 11/25/2021
I might start work on this the next week, 11/29 - 12/03/2021, but not later; otherwise, it has to wait - till February


author: kericapote
comment: [~jun] samples approved.

[~Igor.Khosid] code needs to be released 12/31 so 11/29-12/3 is fine. Approved samples attached. Thanks!!

The mapping for "L17" letter code is missing on SOW. Is it suppose to be for letter 010 or 011? These two letter code are duplicated.

I'm wondering why you changed status to "Waiting for approval"?

As you know this is the Implementation project and samples are already approved.

I'm returning status to "QA in Progress"

Jun, please check the last letter in the print samples (L17). Following the pattern in front of the endorsement, should it say "411" instead of "L17"?

See attached >>>[^Letter should be 411 instead of L17.pdf]

Please create parallel ticket


author: william.kong
comment: [~kericapote]: Live is tomorrow. Parallel still has not been created. We may not be able to make tomorrow's live date unless you can get team to rush parallel.


author: kericapote
comment: [~William.Kong] i will turn over parallel now. I was waiting for them to be done with eom. Live file comes eom so we are ok. THX! Updating live date.


author: william.kong
comment: [~kericapote]: I need this released earlier. [~jun]is reserved for Tax season plus has other existing commitments and I do not want to delay this release. Please ensure all testing is completed on or before 12/15/2021 before the code freeze period. I will update the live date to be 12/15/2021 for now.

author: william.kong
comment: [~kericapote]: Live date is today. I was informed by [~jun]that code release date has changed? Please advise why we cannot release this on the schedule date according to the timeline agreement.


author: william.kong
comment: [~kericapote]: Please advise above. I really want all completed project release earlier so that we can do not scramble towards end of this month. If this is a new application and no data file arrives, i don't see any reason why we cannot release code earlier.


author: kericapote
comment: [~William.Kong] I asked if we can release code early on our call today and they said Yes. Production file comes Jan 3 and we will review prod samples for approval then.


author: william.kong
comment: [~kericapote]: Thanks for the update. Please put a calendar reminder on your schedule to check in on 1st production run to make sure job goes out smoothly. I will adjust the live date for today so that we can release the code.



[~jun]: Please work this [~TunA]this afternoon to release this project early. Thanks!
