comment: Hi Micheal,

I have following question regarding this project.

1.What is login system Q2/fiserv

# what should be password
# user should be create through sso (if not)
# account should be created through sso(if not)
# hashing method as they asked it should be sha-256 higher

2.check image feature is enable or not

3.if a user already enroll through DSO and try to login through SSO. He can directly land in estatement page or he need to complete enrollment without accepting disclosure

4.I need all different type of disclosure (Enrollment, DDA)

5. I need auth file and DDA file to process

6. Should i use Doc process for DDA or else

7.DDA archival period should be 84 month

8.User can change email address from profile page or their email address only update through SSO request

Thanks,

Arifen

I have seen that  _*InfoTrac Admin users will have the ability to update customers delivery preference back to paper only (not paper to electronic)*_. this feature is not currently in infotrac. We need that feature.

comment: Hi Micheal,

i have commit code in trunk as you want to see client what we have now. Code base is not fully tested, DSO login is not working. I have already sent a mail to *Surekha* about  this. Once this fixed i will look on DSO. I have to write back end code for auth file processing. what process you want for Check image  *check_iamge/ check_index*. I need check file,test pdf,disclosure pdf, estatement pdf, disclosure verbiage.Now i am using demo one.

comment: Hi Micheal,

Auth file

* CIF_KEY\-\->(0000SKIFF GA00) is it a string or number,if number then should it have leading zero.if leading zero than it should create problem.
* what is SSN value. TIN column value or else
* what is appType. APPLICATION column value(DD)
* what is appType description for DD
* what is Account_status (A,C or 1, 2,3)



# What is  Electronic Marketing Inserts 
# InfoIMAGE will install a Multifactor Authentication interface requiring customers to enter their last 4 digit of their SSN number as a form of second authentication.Should it replace by one time password MFA module
# I need test pdf,disclosure
# check index file for testing

the account status should either be 'A' or 'C' so just disregard the data if it's anything else

Aparently the following was provided to the client as specifications for auth file.

comment: I have one query for infotrac implementation on User can not go from paper to electronic 

# For enrolled user : When user goes to paper the delivery preference button is getting hidden . So user can not change the delivery preference.  look at Screenshot 1
# But for not enrolled user : When user goes to paper the delivery preference button is not getting hidden . User is able to click the button . But in drop down the option comes only  Paper . User will not be able to go to electronic too.   look at Screenshot 2

My query is For same logic ( User can not go from paper to electronic)  the UI or user flow is different for an enrolled and not enrolled user. . is that ok? or it would be better for not enrolled user also the button for delivery preference can be made hidden.

comment: Hi [~Michael.Holden]  ,



I need some feedback from you.

* Which pdf i should use as enrollment disclosure(e-signDisclosure/privacy Policy)
* Normally we show disclosure content in html format not pdf format. Is it necessary to show disclosure as pdf or we can show its content as html.
* let me know, about  new Auth file check image index file.

thanks,

Arifen


author: 5ba1267164a35f4858f0f5ea
comment: use the e-Sign Disclosure verbiage.
you can translate the pdf to html verbiage if that is required.
we are not getting a new auth file at this time. is the current process working with this auth file?


author: shamsuddoha.arefin
comment: Hi  [~Michael.Holden],

Current process is not  working with this auth file. As we are not sure which column value should be used As SSN. SSN should be *NUMBER (not string)* to register user in hypercube. Moreover, you mention CIF should be string, so we could not use that one. So could you please confirm which column value should be used as SSN, if they do not provide us a new auth file.

thanks,
Arifen


author: shahadet.hossain
comment: Hi [~shamsuddoha.arefin] ,

Please complete the SSO first with the complete flow. We will work with DSO user later, after getting auth data file from client.

comment: Hi [~Michael.Holden] 

 As you mention  

{quote}the account status should either be 'A' or 'C' so just disregard the data if it's anything else

{quote}
According  to your auth file account status is else (1,6). So i  have not inserted any value of that account status. When api try to fetch document from db based on account status(A,C). So it do  not found any document to show, though  document has already posted for that account. So all time account status should come with (A/C).Otherwise we should not get document for that account.Can you please look on that.

thanks,

Arifen

any update about auth files account status column?.

comment: Arifen,

I had a troubleshooting session w/ Q2 trying to login. We are able to login when the account number does NOT have leading zeroes. However, Q2 is sending us the account numbers WITH leading zeroes and is getting an error.

It looks like we are passing incorrect information to the API. Can you check on this.

\[500\] \{"status":"500","message":"Exception when processing account 0000008338: organization not found, pleas                                                                                                                         e check your account number list"\}

Is there a config to strip leadin zeros for the account? Isnt this done automatically? What exactly does prefix0s flag do?


author: shamsuddoha.arefin
comment: Hi [~Michael.Holden],

there is no config to strip leading zeros for the account and this is not done automatically. prefix0s flag used for accept leading zero for cif number.

When we process auth file,strip leading zero for account number.There is  no account for dacb which has leading zero. So account number 0000008338 is incorrect. If Q2 all time send account number with leading zero, we can solve this problem in  two ways.
* insert account number with leading zero when we auth process. In this process we *need to specify account number length* as account number come 20 length in auth file.
* change Q2 method where we can add flag, based on that flag we can strip of leading zero of account number, as this should be a global change.

I think add account number with leading zero in auth file process should be good one. In this case we need account number length.

thanks,
Arifen

Please create a flag to strip account leading zeroes and use for DACBs Q2sso.
Also, include a mask '\*\*\*\*\*\*1234' all but last 4 digits when displaying the account number in the dropdown.

author: shamsuddoha.arefin
comment: Hi [~Michael.Holden],

I have done my coding part. Now sharmina doing her testing,  this needs some global testing.

thanks,
Arifen


author: shamsuddoha.arefin
comment: Hi [~Michael.Holden],

I have seen you  add a flag for strip leading zero of account number. I think this flag should be under  q2sso configuration not out side q2sso, as when a new client use this sso, they have to configure of this flag. In this way , all the configuration should be consistent.

thanks,
Arifen


author: 5ba1267164a35f4858f0f5ea

That is fine. If you have completed your testing we can move your code into pilot. I was only using this as a stop gap because we were troubleshooting with the client these past couple days.

comment: Some Updates requested



* When first enrolling in eStatements, we are presented with the Account Preferences page.  This page lists all of the accounts we have, but does not give us the option to enroll only specific accounts.  Our only option is to Submit All.  This marks all accounts as electronic, and we have to go into the accounts to change them back to paper.  Is there a way that we could select the statements we want to be electronic on that first Account Preferences page rather than going into a different page to unroll?
* Customer Site - Profile: If Delivery Type = Electronic, can the Account # header color be blue; if Delivery Type = Paper, can the Account # header color change to red?
* Customer Site - Drop Down Menu: Can Nickname be displayed (DACB to confirm if Q2 can pass via SSO).
* Customer Site - where is the "DDA" for Account Type coming from - Statement Data, Q2 SSO, etc - please confirm






author: rifat.mahmud
comment: Hi Michael,



* Yes if we change the value of {{forcePaperlessOnEnroll}} to false, then customer can choose between paper and paperless for each account. Do you want the enrollment page like the first screenshot?
* Yes it can be done, we need to work on that. If this change is meant for this client only, then well need a flag and code accordingly. 
* Yes Nickname can be displayed in the dropdown menu. Nicknames can be displayed either from db(usr_acct_type_mapping table) or from sso file.
* DDA is coming from a configuration in properties.json file - {{"accountType": \{  "DD": "DDA"} }}
if any accounts acct_type is DD, it gets converted to DDA for the above configuration.



I will start working on the second item. Let me know if you have any more queries.

Thanks.

comment: Hi Rifat,

I guess I didnt hit save for my commentwierd.

* Yes, please update this flag and the screenshot looks good.
* I have deployed the code into pilot and let Phoebe know to check with the client
* They want it to come from the SSO as they are sending the information during this time.
* ok Thanks. Also I have seen TD and LN' accounts in our database. Was a list of types provided to you at anytime?



New Item: Have you been able to complete a DSO signup & login? I was getting an error when attempting to create a DSO user. The validation kept failing.


author: rifat.mahmud
comment: Hi Michael,

* I dont think we were provided any list of types. I didnt check the SOW though. Ive only found DD in the properties file, and LN in database. 
* Let me know about the nicknames. We can test it as we support nicknames for BANB and can check whether it works perfectly for this client as well.
* Yes we were able to complete a DSO signup and login. For that, we had to process an auth file. What error are you facing? Can you share more details?

Thanks

comment: Hello ,

I need one feedback for the item number 6, which says in smatsheet :

This is from our configuration based on the 'DD' app type from the SSO, we translate to the verbiage 'DDA' for display. We can display something else, or not display - DACB to confirm. DACB Update: Remove account type from displaying.

*Query :* 

We have removed account type on the drop down but on the  left side statement  section we also show DDA statement type . Shall we keep it as it is or rename as estatement or anything you suggest ?
