 Description: Update script to perform check sum only for data files (not productlist and xfer files)
 Date Submitted: 2022-09-09 14:59:18
 Date Last Updated: 2022-09-13 11:32:09
 Files:
 1) sscudle_process.sh

QA checklist:[^qa_check_list_sscudle.pdf]
Please check to see that the code was updated to not include those 2 files in the checksum and ensure that the checksum doesn't include them from test data file

[~Juliana Vannik] 
Once QA is complete, please have Alex test it.

1. Difference prod vs test
> 		  if [[ $filename =~ 'sscu_productlist_LN_MATNT' || $filename =~ 'sscu_xfer' ]]; then
> 			 echo "Skip cksum for productlist_LN_MATNT and xfer file - $filename"
> 			 echo "Skip cksum for productlist_LN_MATNT and xfer file - $filename" >> ${targetDir}/today.log
> 			 continue
> 		  fi
2. sscudle_cksum.log - validated

Please have Alex test it as he made the request for this update on the team support ticket.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~Natalie.Tom] Can you confirm if you just need Alex to reprocess the 8/2 production cycle (in parallel environment) that was noted in the ticket #31298 to perform the test?

Thanks!

Yes, please have Alex test it as he had asked for this update seen in the team support ticket 31298. There is no parallel, so he would have to check to see that the update was made before releasing.

Is there any update from Alex? Live date is today.


author: JIRAUSER11103
comment: [~phoebe.george] [~Juliana Vannik] 
Per my conversation with Alex, he has tested the file:SSCU_DN_08022022_1.zip.pgp with no errors pertaining to the files in the cksum. After asking if he checked the logs for the comment regarding skipping those files and if there were no errors like he mentioned in team support 31298 comment 1, his response was "yes, it looks good. thanks!"

This update will be released by today.
