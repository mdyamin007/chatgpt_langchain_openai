comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] Are we creating enotices for this or just print?

comment: [~Tin.Chak]- eNotices are not to go LIVE until 7/15. I wasn't sure if this eNotice setup could be run concurrently. Please advise.

comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] This enotice can go live at the same time as the general enotice setup on eStatement, but not before. Can you add 4hr estimate for this job? Basically 2hr for each new letter setup. Thanks.

Can you download the SOW and attach it to the ticket?

comment: Hi [~Tin.Chak], [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com],

For new enotice setup, I need some information that I can't find in the SOW. Such as prefix, description, archival period, etc.

In the SOW I saw the Live cycle approval required for Collection letters, So Is it related to the job status? If then needApproval will be true. Am I right?


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~sahossain]- The LIVE cycle approval will be a manual process. So it will be done by DP and myself. Basically DP will process and create PDF samples and email it to me. I will send to the client for approval. You don't need to worry about it.

Archival will be the same as the rest of the collection letters.

[~Tin.Chak]- Can you advise on prefix and description?


author: 5b1ee5a72eea651bacdeca2e
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] The prefix is from the print side. The description is what will be shown on the site, so the client decides that.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~sahossain]- the prefix is DN0 and the description will be "Student Checking Letters".

Do you have index file for 'Student Checking Letters'?

I checked the 'Collection Letters' related tickets but didn't find SOW file and I haven't access to the SOW links. So I didn't find Archival Period.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~sahossain]- Archival is 2 years.

[~Tin.Chak]- Please advise on index file.

comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com],

Print team gave me index file with*dnb* prefix for 'Student Checking Letters' but you provided me *dn0*.

Should i use dnb? Can you please confirm that?


author: 5b1ee5a72eea651bacdeca2e
comment: [~sahossain] Use dnb
