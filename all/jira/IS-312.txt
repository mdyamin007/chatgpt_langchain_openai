From [~ratnam]:

CU confirmed the Loan Number on the statement is not the Member Number and cannot be used for indexing. They are working with FICS to add additional field below Loan Number. CU will send us another set of sample with the additional field.



Also, CU wants to add logo in below section. I have provided EDCU statement Screen shot below including logo. Please review and confirm if this can be implemented.

Hi Eric, please review attached Mortgage FICS PDF sample. CU included Member Number field that will be used to indexing eStatement.

I only see one account included in the PDF. I requested CU to provide one single PDF with multiple accounts and also include few delinquency accounts.

I've the data file with multiple accounts. I'm waiting for the logo file to provide first draft of sample, or should I provide sample without the logo first?


author: eric.yan
comment: [~andreav], [~ratnam] 



The sample is ready for review. I used the logo from escrow statement and want the client to check if that's the logo they wanna use. If the client is ok with this layout, then I could resize it for a proper fit.


author: ratnam
comment: Hi Eric, please review attached .csv reconcile file. Client provided associated provided FICS PDF samples as well but there is issue with blank address over the top of the statement on most of the accounts. I requested CU to send corrected samples.

Meanwhile, please confirm if the .CSV file format works for you?



Thanks

Ratna

comment: Hi Eric, CU wants to hardcode statment name in the index content. Please review and let me know if that wroks.

 # Yes, the CSV file is good. Please let the client know I'll use the loan number to reconcile the data file. I'm assuming the pdf data file should match all records in the csv file mutually. Any missing loan # on either end will be reported. Please check with the client if this logic is correct.
 # The pdf index format is valid. I assume the acct number is the loan number.


author: ratnam
comment: Thanks Eric.



#1 As mentioned earlier, Loan Number will not be used for indexing or cross refer in .csv file. CU is working with FICS to send us new PDF samples with Member Number field added above Loan Number. We should be using Member Number field Value. !image-2021-08-23-17-10-35-568.png!

#2 Member Number field value is the Account Number.

The sample with two logos is ready


author: ratnam
comment: Eric, please help generate sample with attached single account PDF sample*MVCU_FICSMortgageSample* that includes member number. Can you reduce the size of the logo please?


author: andreav
comment: HI Eric, I agree with Ratna, the top logo needs to be reduced in size so that it is not so close to the Loan number on top. Please also move it to the left to align with the Loan Number verbiage. For the remittance, please reduce the size of the logo and move it to the #10 envelope return address window position so that it is more presentable. And lastly, please see if you can make the header bars look like a solid gray instead of dotted (unless this is from the data and out of our control). 


author: ratnam
comment: Eric, CU confirmed we can go ahead and use logo used currently in production that includes address.

Thanks

Ratna


author: eric.yan
comment: [~ratnam] [~andreav] 

I've updated the logo size and position as suggested.

The gray bar looks dotted as a nature of the program (how pdf file is converted to print image and can't be changed.)


author: ratnam
comment: Eric, please note the member number field will be used for indexing and NOT the loan number as per CU. New test data and reconcile file uploaded this morning. Please generate samples using new test data.

comment: Hi Eric,

In scenario where there is no address found in data or DO NOT MAIL verbiage found in address block CU confirmed to suppress from print. Include account in invalid address report, post to eStatement and PDF Archival. Please review Suppression and Invalid address Handling sections updates in SOW. Please let me know if you have any questions.



Thanks

comment: Hi[~eric.yan] ,

There is an issue with the*DocumentBeginDate*&*DocumentEndDate*columns. Can you modify it to be*YYYYMMDD*?


author: eric.yan
comment: [~andreav]

I can't modify the address in data since it's PDF file.



[~ratnam]

Yes, I'll update the verify the logic for invalid address and print suppression. But it's best if the client could send some test data with intended invalid address to test.

Can you confirm the resources/pdf is ok? I tried to manually download the statement and it fails to load. However on our side the wrapper service shows returning pdf w/o issue.

Posted samples are approved on pilot also.

I believe all samples are approved now to move forward for the electronic portion of QA, as I believe the print portion is completed for QA.

[~berezinez] can you confirm?

1), The house grouping logic is implemented, it's based on name and address.

2). To clarify the data verification logic. The program will cross check the scanned pdf data and the checklist provided by the client, if there's any mis-match, the program will exit and send internal notification to DP, who could open a ticket and report the issue. Since the notification/report is internal, I don't think it's necessary to add to SOW.
