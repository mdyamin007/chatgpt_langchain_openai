all projects are in qa folder dl001-012



You can refer to data file/z/daily/bkpl/data_files/BKPL_Daily_Letters_083021_1.txt which got split into files for each letter in/z/daily/bkpl/process_files/ based on code(DD3300P,DD5323P) appear in the previous files. Please refer to sow for that.

dpvs: [^bkpldla230.print]

print range - from 4.2o1 print all pages.

for most of the letters anchor is 001:

!image-2021-09-08-22-01-50-674.png!



except for letter 6,8 - anchor is BANKPLUS that appears at the top of each letter because for this one not all letters start with 001 code

!image-2021-09-08-22-02-24-399.png!





/z/daily/bkpl/BKPL_Daily_Letters_invalid_mail_address_083021_2.csv is invalid address report. The pgp version is in/z/infoftps4/bkpl/client_pickup/.



Also there is requirement for sending dpvs through email. I will forward you an email of it and some more emails that I coded for to do some checks like invalid code found in data file,

unknown file found in zip file etc.



Thanks,

Rony
