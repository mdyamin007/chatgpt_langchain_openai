*Notes for assigned developer (Please add to JIRA Story and Epic):*

- Use and modify the INI and EE used for PLBKDN404 (plbkdn404.ee & plbkdn404.ini). This is ran on the Iswk3 server 124.

- Use prefix plbkdn408 for INI and EE and also to update letter code table in plbkdna_redtitan.control. The verbiage "Loan Rate Change Notice" can be used for description.

- Use file pattern provided by customer to update pdf pattern table and letter code table in plbkdna_redtitan.control.

- This app uses 2 DFA's for all 7 letters. PLBKDNP11.dfa is used for the simplex letters and PLBKDNP21.dfa is used for duplex letters. Please use PLBKDNP11.dfa since this will be a simplex letter.
