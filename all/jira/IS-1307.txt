We discussed this project with Terrence, Peter and team. This job isHOUSEHOLDING setup for ( Monthly Statements and Account Analyis Statements). Because of that, we cannot setup E-Selective Insert feature.

Sorry, I overlook when I do assessment. We will need to cancel this project.

Thanks,

Sorry, we don't, unless we don't useHOUSEHOLDING setup for ( Monthly Statements and Account Analysis Statements). Even client agree to separate Monthly Statements and Account Analyis Statements, we will need more programming time setup as new application forAccount Analysis Statements.

Thanks,

After [~barnetts]escalate this project to Terrence,[~Natalie.Tom]and [~lemoy28]still researching for how we can customized to handle it.
