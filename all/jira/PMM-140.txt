comment: The client still wants to pursue a solution for this issue even though in ticket 13250, Bryant confirmed it is not feasible. Therefore, please work with Tyler to initiate this as an enhancement that will need further review. This is a high priority item and this client will most likely escalate further as they several customer complaints.
