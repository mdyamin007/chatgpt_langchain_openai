comment: [~jun], I'm not seeing any piece code values inside the index file. Can you check on your end?

Also the first line is missing the beginDate field after the zip filename, not sure if that's expected based on the data you received.

comment: Hi [~jun],

I'm seeing this error when posting "The index file doesn't have the corresponding id in IS DB!" From past situations, I believe that sometimes occurs if there is no entry in the linkpaperandestmt table on your side. Can you check? We also may need to double check that PC created/enabled the insert on pilot.

comment: [~jun] I tried posting it on stage, however instead I am getting a different error "Can't replicate the pieceCode info in InfoTRAC!" I checked infotrac stage Insert Management tab and I only see one form that doesn't list the piece code from the index file, 33473. We might need PC to see if they can correct it.
