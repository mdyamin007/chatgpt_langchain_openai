description: UPDATE 8/24/22: Per ticket #31757, comment 22 and 25, MFCU has requested to use branch code 3 TIFF for 7. They want to HOLD the change of not using a TIFF if a branch code is not recognized. This will revisited at a later time.

This is a hot fix to not use any tiff signature if the branch code is unknown.

comment: [~jun], does this need to be sent to MFCU for review since this is a hot fix? Is MFCU aware of this?

Thanks

comment: [~dyuen],

In ticket 31757, MFCU is okay with releasing without the signature showing. In ticket 31778, I suggested to make the hot fix, but I don't know if MFCU is aware that we are making this hot fix.

comment: [~jun], spoke with Jessica. She thinks we should do a sample review with the client. I'll update the Jira once I have approval.

Thanks


author: dyuen
comment: [~jun], Jira description updated.

[~Shun.Kuwashima] [~eric.yan], can one of you guys help upload the new resource for this update? We are using branch code 3 TIF for branch code 7.

[~gthillaivel]FYI
