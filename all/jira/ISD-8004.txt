Add Balance Transfer Promotion

Please use the data that is in the 582 fields as follows:
 APR is zero,
 Periodic interest rate is also zero, and that is in the data file and labeled 582-57 field
 Days in billing Cycle = 582-74
 Average Daily Balance=582-48
 Periodic Interest Charge = 0.00 (since APR is zero)

Is it possible to code the logic just for this statement run that if the 582-57 field is 0.00 then, to print out the APR, and Periodic Interest Charge as zero?

[~barnetts] This doesn't require anything for release from ISD's side, just testing/support when necessary. Also as Sean mentioned above the ISD hours is missing from the right side section of the story, please add that in when you get the chance. Thanks
