title: RHS-Parallel: Errors while processing CAMB, FCSB, and GCBK
description: Errors I received when trying to reprocess on rhs parallel without commenting out infotrac and message manager. Not sure which errors actually need to be looked into.

Today I got errors on CAMB and FCSB message manager whereas yesterday I did not.

The ca-oracle-dv-01 was not working. I had to modify the docker-compose.yml file and alias ca-oracle-dv-01 to use the ca-oracle-pr-01 IP address temporarily since it is one physical server. Both prod, dev & stage are sharing this box.

FCSB got invalid username/pw error !image-2020-10-09-15-20-02-536.png|width=974,height=61!

Reviewed the print AFPs and they are good.

comment: [~shailendrar]: Can you review this issue? YaMee was testing fcsb and got the error above. I noticed "http://sqlalche.me" which leads me to believe that this is related to ca-isapps-sg-01 InfoSYNC API. Can you confirm my assessment is correct.


author: shailendrar
comment: [~William.Kong] - olp_handler.sh is still pointing to old is-apps server:



set_online_proofing_base_url(){

# online_proofing_url="http://is-apps-dev.infoimage.com/infosync/v1"

if [ "${HOSTNAME}" = "rht" -o "${HOSTNAME}" = "rht.infoimage" -o "${database}" = "test" ]
 then
 online_proofing_url="http://is-apps-dev.infoimage.com/infosync/v1"

elif [ "${testmode}" = "y" -a "${HOSTNAME}" != "rht" ]
 then
 online_proofing_url="http://is-apps-stage.infoimage.com/infosync/v1"
 else
 online_proofing_url="http://is-apps-prod.infoimage.com/infosync/v1"
 fi

echo "new online proofing url is $online_proofing_url"

}

On the brisbane RHS server, i have the /etc/hosts files to have these URL points to brisbane infosync system:

!image-2020-10-13-14-29-12-361.png!



Is the error message coming from Brisbane infosync server or rhs server?  If the error message is invoked within InfoSYNC servers, then I need to add the /etc/hosts records to the docker container.



Thanks!

comment: [~William.Kong] The error is from Brisbane RHS server. Let me research more as the issue is not related to URL.


author: shailendrar
comment: [~William.Kong] - Assigning back to you as Brisbane RHS system is not available for Papyrus testing due to license switch. [~yameelee] will re-run the jobs when RHS is available.

Per the initial analysis; issue could be related to https://jira.infoimageinc.com/browse/IBTL-112.

comment: [~shailendrar]: Thanks for the update. I will demote this ticket for now until we can re-active RHS server testing.

comment: [~yameelee]: The Out of memory error was not from ISIS. Can we try processing again?


author: william.kong
comment: [~yameelee]: After you re-test, please report your findings into this ticket.


author: yameelee
comment: Still got the same error of "Out of memory"

Would you let me know how to run that job?

I already removed checksum and files are in test BU

comment: Will,

Ernest and I were unable to process FCSB due to error on DT_JOB_ID and esup bin. Do I need to request PC to create new DT_JOB_ID for all 4 applications to retest? Not really sure what happened as I was able to process them in October with just the oracle message error before. I tried using old DT_JOB_ID and the 999999 but both gave same error.

comment: [~yameelee]: We are going to need to post this next week and might re-test with a valid DT_JOB_ID.
