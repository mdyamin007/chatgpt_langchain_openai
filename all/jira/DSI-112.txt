title: EWBB - Website (ROOT) fix for accounts with large number of accounts
description: EWBB has some users that a huge amount of accounts (in the 1000). This causes the ROOT site to load very slowly because it has to load 1000 elements sometimes. Please research and develop a way for the pages to load faster, possibly by using pagination.



Usually the large number of accounts are logged on using ACI. If you do not have a way to generate the SessionID for ACI, please use the script attached below. Use the file String to point at the xml in the SSO folder. Then simply run the script. It should output an XML that includes the SessionID.

comment: Tai Trinh,

Last month i solved same issue for banb. It was taking 5/6 minutes to render the enrollment page when account number was 400+. There was a coding issue in enrollment page and i fixed it. I am not sure ewbb is using current code base or older. There could be a solution if still having same issue in enrollment and profile page because in both page we are showing same account. Currently we are loading all accounts in first page load and it might take time to view or render all accounts. Pagination or populating 10 or 20 accounts at a time and showing a more button or link to view next 10 or 20 accounts so on. That will decrease the page loading time. I need your suggestions

Yes, both enrollment and profile page are experiencing the same issue.

I think loading 20 accounts at a time with pagination is a great idea. Please proceed.

What's the status on this project? When do you think you can complete the code and finish testing?

The client is escalating, but we just need to provide them with a timeline.

Is what I'm seeing with the + signs the account_owner_name? I don't remember that being displayed for EWBB SSO sites. 

It's also a bit clunky how some dropdown takes up two lines while others may take up 1 line. If possible, please have them be listed out one per line like how it currently is. I also don't think we need to add the account: dda and the account name as that is not how it's currently is for EWBB.
