title: Display disclaimer page when user first login
description: Update InfoTRAC to force first time user to agree to new disclaimer page.
For existing user, they should be prompted to agree to new disclaimer page on their first login after this go live.

Attached are the Disclaimer document and the Privacy Document.  We need to host the Privacy Policy document on InfoTRAC and add it as a link to the Disclaimer doc (end of first paragraph on page 2).

To All,



Unfortunately, I has been informed that we has to rollback this update and shelf this item for the time being.

Please rollback this piece of code and redeploy the change to pilot tomorrow morning.

We can close out this ticket as well.



Thanks
