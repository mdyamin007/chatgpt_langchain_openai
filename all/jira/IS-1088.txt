comment: Hi [~jun],

Turnover date for this story is late. For some reason, the entry was removed from IS Upcoming list.

Please see you can still give sample in 05/10. If not, please propose new sample date to[~phoebe.george].

Thanks,

Tun

comment: [~jun] SSCU is working to validate pilot site for the 5498ESA. SSCU sent their TEST 5498 file as well as they finalize their production file. Can you process this to pilot also? This file received today, 5/10:
|TEST/SSCU_5498_050522_1609_TEST.zip|

Thanks!

Should I use the same cross reference file "sscu_*5498esa*_xref_eTax_04252022.zip.pgp" for *5498*?


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~jun] SSCU sent this file just now via FTP: sscu_5498_xref_eTax_04252002.txt - can you use with the 5498 test file sent yesterday for pilot testing?

comment: [~jun] [~TunA] One item that I did not take into consideration for the eTax update is the paperless file for taxes. This also includes member number. Can you confirm if the same number used to index/post will be used for identifying for eSUPP/paperless?

Yes, member number is used for e-sup.

Here are the counts for e-sup:

5498:3125

5498ESA: 5


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~jun] [~Shun.Kuwashima] Pilot site is approved for both 5498 and 5498SA.

Please move forward with next steps.

[~Juliana Vannik] you can move the epic status to Approved.

comment: [~phoebe.george]: [~jun]will be OOO Friday and Monday. We need to get QA to complete no later than Thursday. Given the approvals are late, can live date be moved after Tuesday? If not, everything must be completed by Thursday so that it can be released thursday afternoon.
