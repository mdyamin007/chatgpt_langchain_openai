Turnover Date: 1/3/2022

Sample Date: N/A

IS Assessment:

Update script /home/master/apcudlc_process.sh to use from this naming convention:

APCU_DN_Archival_mmddyy_seg#.zip.seq#



to



APCU_DN_Archival_mmddyy_seg#_seq#.zip

Ithinkthe line 626 section of the code is where you need to make the adjustments.

comment: [~tanmay]: Thanks! I've confirmed it looks good in the /z/pdf_afp/apcu/apcudlc/zip folder.



[~jharvey]: The test files are located in:apcu/client_pickup/test/APCU_DN_Archival_121021_1_001.zip.pgp; Please ask client to review so that we can go live by Thursday 1/6 so that it takes effect Friday 1/7/2022.

Client confirmed samples are good. Is there any way that we can release code for this early in the day on 1/6, after all their regular jobs process? We need to reprocess the really large archival for 23801 because there were some issues with it and he would like it with this new naming format but would like that sent over before end of day on 01/06 if possible.


author: william.kong
comment: [~tanmay]: Please submit program transfer form. We will do a quick code review audit. If there is no issues, we will release tomorrow.

[~jharvey]: We will see how the code review goes tomorrow. If it goes well, we can target to release either end of day 1/4 or on 1/5. We will confirm with you tomorrow afternoon.

comment: I received word from Jared that the wrong letter name was contained in the archival he received for the job completed on IS-617. I included a screenshot below. Would you please make sure this is corrected? Once we release code for the update to the archival naming convention inIS-704, we need to reproduce the archival for this job for APCU.



Episys - Annual Donation Notice was used in the index file when it should have been Episys - Terms and Conditions Update. See below
