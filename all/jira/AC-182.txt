title: WECU [22239] [pvt] Click Tracking Report [in house]
description: Per Tai:

This will be 5 hours. But because it's our mistake on bad release, it's not billable.


Targetting live date of 9/8.



Do note also that because click tracking hasn't been working at all, we would have no history. It would only start working beginning whenever we deploy the fix.
