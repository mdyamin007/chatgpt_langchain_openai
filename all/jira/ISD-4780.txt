comment: [~tye.wu@infoimageinc.com]I didn't realize this was assigned to you already, so I added the notice description for you on all the lower environments. Fyi, enotice descriptions are expected to not display on the site, so there's no need to validate that portion. Once we get client approval (you can either check TS 19853 or the IS story assigned to Jun for updates on that), please support QA if they have any issues testing on pilot/stage, and work on the parallel ticket when assigned.

Once parallel is passed and we are given the ok to release to production, please add the notice code/description - 002/Solar Loan Welcome Letter - to the doc_desc table on production.
