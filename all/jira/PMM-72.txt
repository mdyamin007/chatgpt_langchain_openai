description: Just like you did with Tina, David for Color Message Manager




author: bryanl
comment: Per Will:

Ive included David T. so that he is on the same page. Here is the assumed pre-requisite for the Color Message Manager:



*+Pre-requisite:+* 

Requires Existing COLOR Print application w/ B&W Message manager & using our standard selective criteria. (i.e. we are not change the existing criterias that client currently has).



If that is the case, then AC team can initiate a request for both IS & ISD to convert *+existing+* B&W Message Manager to Color Message Manager via TeamSupport and Redmine JEF, then the SLA will be as follows:



Hypercube Resource Hours: 4

Prism Resource Hours: 4

IS Dept Print Team Hours: 5

Turnaround time (from job turnover date): 7 days

Priority to sell services: 2



However, if the prerequisite is not met, then we will need to assess the additional effort and the SLA will be different.
