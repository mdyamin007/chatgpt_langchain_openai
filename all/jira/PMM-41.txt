title: Expedited DirectMail - New Product

 * Allow us to start off with a basic foundation to rebuild relationships with clients
 * Build our clients' confidence due to absence of any variable data or complexity
 * Later add more high value work with variable data and high profit margins (Eg. pre-approval campaigns, welcome kits)
