new encrypted file: /z/infoftps3/CAMB/client_pickup/CAMB_ESMO_ESQU_COUNTS_08152022.txt.pgp

[~Igor.Khosid]: Per [~MattL], will bypass parallel as I am just encrypting the file.

FYI: Also updated cnt_from_header_rec=`grep "^0001" ${data_file} | wc -l | tr -d '\r'` as the combine.dat file no longer exist since may 2021 there is only 1 data file and no longer have to be combined so the count was always 0.
