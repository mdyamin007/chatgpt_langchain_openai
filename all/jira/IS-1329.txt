comment: Hi [~dawnl]
I am not able to find any data file for 1099A.
Can you please get it from client?

And can you get the DT_JOB_ID for mpcu 1099misc on parallel?
Thanks


author: dawnl
comment: Hi [~zhuoxinT],

IsDT_JOB_ID the test job ID? If yes, just use 999999.

Thanks.

comment: Hi [~zhuoxinT],

Client has uploaded MPCU_1099A_010715_0958_PROD.IRF to the TEST folder.

for the request on the index file,
we can do like this. Correct me if I am wrong.
The member number can have multiple accounts, but they are all combined to 1099i, so they are pointing to 1 pdf.

comment: [~dawnl] 
There is an issue on data. The 1099A data we received from client has tax-year '2014'.
Can we request a data for '2021'? I can generate another sample for that.
Thanks

Can you make sure thatthe account number will be in the archive file when a current 1099A file is provided? See the feedback from client:

"Maps is not able to provide 1099A from 2021. The last time Maps had a 1099A reporting was for tax year 2014. However, we may receive one at any time.

Please assure Maps that the account number will be in the archive file when a current 1099A file is provided."

comment: [~dawnl] 
I can manually modify the data and test it.
I will attach the sample once its done.


author: JIRAUSER11101
comment: [~dawnl]
Because our script will look at the tax year on the data to select different DFA file to process.
The 2014 version DFA has different set up. That's why we don't see the account number on the first sample.

Here's the output after modified the year on the data.

comment: [~dawnl] 
what is the status for this?


author: dawnl
comment: [~zhuoxinT]- for invalid address, If it says"No PDF via FTP for standard set ups". Dose it mean the statements with invalid address will not be included in PDF archival?


author: JIRAUSER11101
comment: [~dawnl] 
I am not sure what this means, but this job is to add the archival for MPCU tax.


author: dawnl
comment: [~zhuoxinT] - so all tax forms will have archival regardless if the address is valid or not, right?


author: JIRAUSER11101
comment: [~dawnl] 
yes, right.


author: dawnl
comment: [~zhuoxinT],

Here is client's feedback for invalid address:

"If one of the following is entirely missing, please PRINT & send to Maps CU (MPCU):
 * House Number
 * Street Name
 * City
 * State
 * Zip code

"

Do you need to add code to insure that?

Thanks.


author: JIRAUSER11101
comment: [~dawnl] 
I need to discuss with Tun. I will get back to you after that.


author: JIRAUSER11101
comment: [~dawnl] 

We can handle the invalid address letter. But to determine whether it is invalid or not, we use the USPS software. It will look at the whole address. not just street or city.

We do need to add more codes on.
We can add the misc_type='rtm', then our program can Print and Return entire output flat to MPCU for those invalid address account.

Please update the SOW and let me know if you want me to do that.

It would be print and ship to client on SOW 3.11.

Thanks

Here is the feedback from Calvin:

"The Endorsement & IMB is coded correctly for 1099A, 1099C, 1099INT, 1099MISC and 1098.

Is 1099INT supposed to be stock code 4000 regular white? It's coded 4006 (2-line perf). It looks like a non-standard tax form.

"

Can you check 1099INT?




author: JIRAUSER11101
comment: [~dawnl]
 On SOW:
 # *Material for print:* Plain White, 24# 2-line perforated paper (form 4006). #10 In-house Tax dbl window envelope (form 4404)

I didnt change anything on this and this is default for all standard tax.
