comment: [~tient]: Thanks for reporting this database issue. It's confirmed. The Database is not fully migrated over yet. I will leave this ticket assigned to me for now. When the database is back up and running, I will re-assign ticket to ask you to re-test.

comment: [~tient]Per my email today, since the database is up. Can we resume testing to get through the database connection step?:

Now MM3 has issue. pui.stage is not accessible:

[http://pui-stage.infoimageinc.com/MsgServlet22?cid=idcu&apptype=ms1&cycledate=07312020&services=print]



Please help look into it. Thanks

comment: [~tient]: Just an update. I believe psi-stage.infoimageinc.com is working as late last week. However, b/c this ticket was using RH2, i cannot ask you to retest. Only RHS ISIS license is activated. If you can manually test it on RH2 to confirm it is working then let me know. In the meantime, i will keep this ticket assigned to me. Thanks!

Will: Can you help create/z/isd_input_dev/I3/IS/idcu folder on bb rh2? Looks like stage pui still not working, but I just want to make sure it's not due to the missing folder issue. Thanks

comment: [~tient]: Thanks for being proactive on this ticket. I checked with David to see why files are not sync. But he just also informed me that he needs to change the server since now that we have the Isilon storage servers working last Wed/thursday, i think he is going to migrate the files over.

comment: [~tient]: Can you please re-test this ticket and complete before Friday of this week. RH2 test license is active and would like to re-test this in*parallel* environment.

comment: [~William.Kong]: The MM3 pui stage is good now. Job is running eStmt option. I'll keep you update on the other error as the job is running eStmt option.

comment: [~William.Kong]: The paper was processed ok without the DB error. (Note: I had to comment out the infotrac flag as it still failed as the check file id.)


author: william.kong
comment: [~tient]: Thanks for getting this done. The 'check file id' usually is because we did not scan the file into the database. This has been reported several times in our parallel testing and I've asked the team to place the file back into the /z/infoftp_int/ to get scanned and it seemed to work. I believe this would be the case too. I'll consider this closed. Thx!
