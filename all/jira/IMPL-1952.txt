title: MFCU - TS 27139 - Mortgage Statements Mail Stop(MS) Number is Incorrect for Member Business Loans - HOT RUSH for 3/13 LIVE!
description: We just discovered that on our Monthly Mortgage Statement for February 2022 the Mail Stop (MS) number referenced on the statement is incorrect for commercial loans.    There is an indicator in our Mortgage Statement file that designates the record for a commercial or non-commercial loan.  Please see the enclosed documentation for clarification.

We will need to have this fixed before our next mortgage statement processing on March 13, 2022.
