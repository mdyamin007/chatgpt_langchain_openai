description: Please refer to Smartsheet:

[https://app.smartsheet.com/sheets/V9xwHXJPFF9m375vQ6QcH4H953WMRvh7RJ3R6J31]



Please prioritize and work on the IS servers first.



Refer to "Server Name" column

Please use the "Brisbane IP (New VM)" for the numeric IP address; However, if you see an IP address in "Brisbane IP (Cloned VM)", then use the Clone VM ip address instead of the new VM IP address.



The domain name will be infoimageinc.com



e.g.:

ca-isis-pr-01.infoimageinc.com



In order to keep track which ones Network setup, please change the font color back to black on the "Server Name" column so that we know it is completed.

comment: *PREM:* Is there a way I can just ping the A-Record prefix only versus typing the entire URL?



e.g.:

ping ca-preproc-pr-02

instead of

ping ca-preproc-pr-02.infoimageinc.com

comment: Yes you can do that.

You have to add the DNS suffix (in this case infoimageinc.com) in the network setting so you can ping only by name (not fqdn).

Please see attach pic as to where we ad dns suffix in windows.
