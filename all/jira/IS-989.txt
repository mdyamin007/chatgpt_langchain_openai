title: EQBK - [23136][pvt][in-house] DP / EQBK DL Processing Enhancement to add sub-folders
description: Add sub-folders to the DL Processing.



Assessment Details (IS):
 - Parallel required: (yes)(** Required to test with DP for update requirements)

 - Update eqbkdl_process.sh to use segment numbers from zip file name

File name: EQBK_DN_<mmddyy>_*<seg>*.zip
 - Get the segment# from data file before calling to proc_arg_verify.sh

The new process should be: /home/master/eqbkdl_process.sh (bypass or 0)
 - Update procedure file accordingly.

Migrate this processing program to be able to run on RHS server instead of RH2

Update the PDF archival script to use our standard afp2pdf.py instead of the old preprocessing02 server.

I am getting an error when calling the get_infotrac.pl in RH2. eqbkdl_process.sh uses RH2 server for processing. do you have any suggestion?

comment: Hi [~tohidulI],



Are you asking to have EQBK test the archival since you are changing the processing server from RH2 to RHS?



Thank-you,

comment: Hi [~William.Kong]

Do we need to send the archival zip file to EQBK to test?

To compare the big afp files from RH2 and RHS I need to generate the big afp file from RH2 server.If I run the old script in RH2, I get the following error.

comment: [~tohidulI]: Can you run your pdf program on the most current production file? (EQBK_DN_052622_2.zip) I want to compare the PDFs from production with your version to make sure the content is the same.

I've copied the production file to:

/d/ac-secure-share/dsi_print/tohidulI/eqbk/is-989/EQBK_DN_052622_2.zip





If it is ran correct, I would expect your program to produce theEQBK_D-1_Archival_05262022_2.zip archival file. Please let me know where the pdf archival file is so that I can review and compare with production.



Also, i noticed that you are not using the standardized folder name conventions. Can you please adjust to be:



$d_dir/pdf_afp/eqbk/eqbkdla/pdf

$d_dir/pdf_afp/eqbk/eqbkdla/zip

$d_dir/pdf_afp/eqbk/eqbkdla/work



Would like to keep the processing folder structure consistent and standardized.

archival sample location:

/z/infoftps3/EQBK/client_pickup/EQBK_D-1_Archival_05262022_2.zip



also changed to code to use the standardized folder name conventions.

comment: Hi [~kdishroon]

can you check IS-698?


author: william.kong
comment: [~tohidulI]/[~rony]: Is the test code updated in Parallel? I was testing in RHS and it complain that the script required to be ran on RH2. This leads me to believe the parallel code is not updated with the change pertaining to this project. I want to verify the PDF archival content looks OK.



In addition, I'm also troubleshooting why the big afp is not backedup in /d/afpformat/ folder. This particular logic is not coded by you but from a different global isisdisk_daily.sh logic that I want to trouble using this program.

comment: [~tohidulI]: Can you advise why this error is occurring in parallel? Did I run this incorrectly:



oper1@rhs ~> /home/test/master/eqbkdl_process.sh 1 bypass

ls /z/ftpbu/eqbkbu/DN/ | grep -P 'EQBK_DN_\d\{6}(_.*zip|.zip)' | head -1
Invalid argument!
Usage: /home/test/master/eqbkdl_process.sh segment[1,2,3....] \{0|bypass} input_file
oper1@rhs ~> echo $?
1

comment: Hi Will,



please use
/home/test/master/eqbkdl_process.sh bypass

We are using the segment number from the data file.

Any feedback?

comment: [~rony]& [~tohidulI]: Sorry! was on vacation and missed this. I checked the pdf archival portion only with cycle 7/14 seg #2. The pdfcompare utiltity did not detect any differences. Please go ahead and submit this project to QA so that they can verify the other specification changes as well.



I've placed my pdf archival testing files in:/d/ac-secure-share/is/williamK/is-989/eqbkdla_0714.zip if QA wants to review my test results between prod & parallel.

comment: Hi [~kdishroon]

Would you please create parallel form.



[~tohidulI]



Thanks


author: william.kong
comment: [~kdishroon]: Can you please get this into parallel process? This in-house ticket has been outstanding for a while and DP would like to get this out of the way.



[~rony]: Since [~tohidulI]is no longer with us any more, will you be assisting with the parallel? In meantime, I will update due date to 8/25/2022


author: william.kong
comment: [~rony]: I did not realize this project is still waiting for [~kdishroon]to create parallel. Will you be taking over this?



Because I did not realize this was still outstanding, Jason was testing this program and ran into the following issue. Can you or the new designated person research this?

comment: Hi [~William.Kong]

Remove the segment number when running the script. The script will get the segment number from the data file name.

for example

/home/test/master/eqbkidl_process.sh bypass


author: william.kong
comment: [~tohidulI]: I still have the same issue without using segment number. If it does not need segment number then the verbiage below should also be adjusted as well b/c it is very misleading. Please advise.

author: tohiduli
comment: Hi [~William.Kong]



There should be a data file in /z/ftpbu/eqbkbu/DN/ directory with file patternEQBK_DN_<MMDDYY>_<Segment>.

I updated the script to give appropriate error message if the data file is not found
