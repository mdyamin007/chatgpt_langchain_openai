Regarding the logo in the top left, this needs to be placed by InfoImage to fit the return address window of the envelope. When we originally setup our other letters, we did tap testing, etc. to be sure it fit properly. If the envelopes will be the same, then the placement should be fine, but we'll want to see some samples before mailing.
