Per SSCU,
Business is requesting samples based on more recent data.  Could you provide new samples?  Current samples are from prior to the conversion. Could they use some of our live files from the past month?  

Thanks, Barnett

I'm sure they're referring to the SSCUME3 samples as it didn't contain data from October, but since you didn't mention which one, attached are both samples:
[^SSCUME31_NEW_SAMPLE.pdf]
[^SSCUML31_NEW_SAMPLE.pdf]
