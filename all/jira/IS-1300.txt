comment: [~thomasY], would you be able to provide a possible sample date?


author: thomasy
comment: [~Ricky Lopez]Please set a sample date of 7/22 for now.

comment: [~thomasY] [^Visa_Credit_Card_Agreement_#249_Visa_Signature_Final.docx]  [^Visa_Credit_Card_Agreement_Consumer_Final.docx] -Client has provided two files to be included with samples.


author: thomasy
comment: [~Ricky Lopez]What am I doing with those 2 documents you attached. Are both of them getting added to the end of each account?


author: JIRAUSER11400
comment: [~thomasY] I am checking with client on this?


author: JIRAUSER11400
comment: I am getting client to provide cover sheets.


author: thomasy
comment: [~Ricky Lopez]Why do we need a cover sheet? The doc files look like disclosures we append to each account?


author: thomasy
comment: [~Ricky Lopez]I've attached a sample from the first file.[^rwcudp001.pdf]

There may be an issue with page 15 when it converts because it is originally in landscape orientation. Are they able provide that page in portrait orientation.?


author: JIRAUSER11400
comment: [~thomasY] please disregard the Visa documents, this will be a different application entirely.

RWCU is checking on portrait and landscape orientation, they are not sure if possible. Could you create a test print client would like to see output?
Thanks
Ricky

comment: [~Ricky Lopez]A print sample will have to wait until month end processing is over.


author: JIRAUSER11400
comment: Hi [~thomasY], was this print sample, able to be generated? Thanks 


author: thomasy
comment: [~Ricky Lopez]I'll work on getting a dpvs.


author: thomasy
comment: [~Ricky Lopez]I attached a dpvs. Please request to print everything from the hvy file.[^rwcudpr109.print]

author: JIRAUSER11400
comment: [~thomasY] is there anything we can do for the page changed to portrait, a portion of image is cut off. 
 !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! 


author: thomasy
comment: [~Ricky Lopez]There's nothing we can do about that. We can't selectively rotate a page if it's in landscape, the program automatically does it. They will need to provide that page in portrait.


author: JIRAUSER11400
comment: [~thomasY] per client: Currently we are do not have our documents stored in a way where we can reliably pull them in portrait. In the future we will have this capability but it will probably be at least 6 months out. We have a sample of what it will look once we are able to pull in portrait. I have attached that sample.  [^Official Check Sample.pdf] 


author: JIRAUSER11400
comment: [~Peter.Dang]-Are there any possible options for this orientation issue? 


author: JIRAUSER11400
comment: [~Peter.Dang]-Following up on this one. If there are no options I will work with client. Thanks


author: JIRAUSER11400
comment: [~thomasY]-We will have to go with the file that prints landscape for now on pg 15. In a few months they will be able to rotate  [^RWCU-PDF portrait.pdf]  to this.


author: thomasy
comment: [~Ricky Lopez]Are the samples approved then?

Please also set a new live date.


author: thomasy
comment: [~Ricky Lopez]Any update?


author: JIRAUSER11400
comment: [~thomasY] They did approve I am checking one more item with client.


author: JIRAUSER11400
comment: [~thomasY]-client has approved

I created a bug concerning envelopes - operations tell me we cannon use non-permit envelope 5627 as envelope 1 & 2. Not sure who's supporting SOW now.


author: JIRAUSER11700
comment: [~phoebe.george] [~Igor.Khosid] [~Ricky Lopez] [~thomasY]

In continuation of today's meeting:

1. Open question left: envelope used. Do we use hvy envelope if the number of printed pages is low? If we don't, this can be an issue.The cover page as per samples does not contain OMR and barcode.

2. This task is an application. So, it has to be in ETA board.

3. Were there approved samples? Turnover meeting?






author: JIRAUSER11700
comment: [~phoebe.george] [~Ricky Lopez] [~thomasY]

Any updates?


author: thomasy
comment: [~Ricky Lopez] [~phoebe.george]Can you answer the question about the envelope before I start another process?

comment: [~thomasY] [~Ricky Lopez]

Please note we have one bug left about the app not being present at ETA board. Please resolve before we can let this task go.

[~Ricky Lopez] [~phoebe.george]

do I understand correctly that no endorsement is required unless it is requested at the customer's discretion?

!endorsement.png!

It's rather confusing as it mentions #10 envelope and custom outer envelope...


author: JIRAUSER11700
