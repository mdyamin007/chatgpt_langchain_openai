title: BRIL:[pvt][29036] Setup eStatement Files and Revert to Paper Process 
description: 1. Reference EQBK process for the enrollment/revert to paper update and replicate for Brilliant Bank (BRIL) setup; reference JEF #48443 and TS#18069, comment #37
Update the Paperless Management report to have an expiration for new users to 30 days. If after 30 days, the enrolled account is still not linked to any enrolled user, the account will be reverted back to paper statements.
 
2. Setup process to provide BRIL with Paperless Report and External Enrollment File; same as what is currently in place for EQBK.
Files will still be dropped into EQBK Client Pickup folder, but labeled as BRIL.

comment: [~Ethan.Yu]per our zoom chat, is this one good to go on pilot? Also, do you have a recommendation on how to test?

comment: [~Ethan.Yu] [~Ricky Lopez] Please hold off on releasing this; I'll provide an update tied to the print statements and will confirm target release date.

comment: [~Ethan.Yu] But in the meantime, how best should we test this out on pilot? Let us know if you want to discuss in more detail by phone. Thanks!

comment: Hi [~phoebe.george],

Do we have a new release date for this yet?

I can follow up on the testing method.

comment: Hi [~phoebe.george]

Any updates on the new timeline?


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~Ethan.Yu] Sorry for the delay, we are targeting to get the print DDA live by 10/31. 

However, now that I think about it, your release for this should be independent of the IS print portion, since we only cycle statements at EOM.

You are approved to move forward to schedule release; please confirm that it can be done no later than EOM. Thanks!


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~Ethan.Yu] Can you confirm if we can move forward with this update to have in place for EOM? Please reference my previous comment. Thanks!

[~Ricky Lopez] FYI

comment: [~Ethan.Yu] [~Tin.Chak] Please provide an update on this today, this was approved back on 10/14 and need to confirm when it can be released as it needs to be run by EOM. Thanks

This is set up on production. However, I haven't see any paperless files to process for BRIL.
