Statement graph modified to plot 12 months of data.
 YTD and LST12 data are still not suppressed from being plotted on the graph - please confirm and (or) update the descriptions; see below

comment: Igor,



Description updated. We should be displaying YTD and LST12.


author: igor.khosid
comment: samples ready for Customer review


Please, request the print samples after the sample will be approved by the customer


author: william.kong
comment: [~Kbittmann]: Is this project approved? Please advise as the approval date was yesterday 2/10.


author: JIRAUSER10911
comment: [~William.Kong]

No, I have followed up with the client on this and no response.


author: JIRAUSER10911
comment: [~thomasY]

Please see client request below. 

Are you able to provide a sample _without_ YTD and LST12 on the graph_?_

Because those numbers are so much higher it is muddying the other graphical data.

Please client feedback below:

We approve the latest sample that does *not* contain the YTD and LST12 data on the graph.

While reviewing these samples we found a minimal error that is currently in PROD today that is coming through in the statement file to InfoImage.

Under the Account History section, 'Ttl Fees Due This Statment' Statement is spelled incorrectly by missing the 'e'.

I will have Weiland update this. Just to confirm, once updated, will that update translate over to InfoImage and the monthly statement?

author: thomasy
comment: [~Kbittmann]Yes, it will be reflected on our end if they fix that typo in their data.

comment: [~thomasY]

Please advise on a new live date.


author: thomasy
comment: [~Kbittmann]We can aim for 02/25

Thomas - are you done? Why is it turned over to QA?


author: thomasy
comment: [~Igor.Khosid]Samples were approved. We need to finish QA.


author: igor.khosid
comment: [~thomasY]
Does Kris know that client needs to update the data file?


author: thomasy
comment: [~Igor.Khosid] [~Kbittmann] The data issue doesn't affect the changes made. Since it is a production issue from their end as well I don't think we should hold up QA to wait for it.


author: igor.khosid
comment: [~thomasY] [~Kbittmann]

That is why I'm asking if the client knows that?


author: william.kong
comment: [~Kbittmann]: Is 2/25 Friday live date ok. For now, I'm going to update the revised live date of 2/25. If there any concerns, please let us know ASAP.

Please also help respond to Igor's comment above thanks.



Thanks!
