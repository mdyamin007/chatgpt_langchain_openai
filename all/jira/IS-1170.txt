title: SNFB - [29521][pvt] SNFB Guardian - Update Mortgage Statements to change CRE to selective
description: Update program per Black Knight specs below:
Update CRE to selective depending on if customer does ACH payments or not.
Logic: If ACH field position (1970  1971) = Y, then insert CRE.

comment: [~rumanb]I will take over this JIRA, I'm working on IS-1143 and can make this simple change along with that one.

comment: QA:

Please compare insert BIN 1 count in test DPVS versus prod DPVS. You will see that selective CRE is now set and only non ACH accounts get insert. The counts are also reflected on infoTRAC. I also have attached a list of non ACH and ACH accounts, this can be used to compare counts.
