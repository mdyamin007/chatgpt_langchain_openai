comment: Hi Joe,

I have processed etax and for etax processing, it inserts default as stmt_type in paperless2 table. I have also checked the code for auth processing, and for any account_type, it inserts both default and mortgage in paperless2 table. Shouldnt etax be added as stmt_type while auth/etax process? 

Thanks,

Rifat

comment: they do not have selective paperless for their etax, so it's correct that it should only be the "default" paperless stmtType for etaxes

comment: Then we should remove the check for Mortgage statement. Any DSO user with account type L should be able to see the statements for that accout.

comment: I dont want to touch anything thats currently already there on production. So lets leave it for now.

comment: The code will not fetch etax as current update search account the way it was searching mortgage. So if we want to enable the dso user etax we need to update production code.

comment: Or we can keep the code as is and plus the code for fetching default with account type L
