comment: [~rodriguez]: Can you try it one more time. When you got the error above, I think we were in the starting to move systems around. Please retest and re-assign back to me if it is indeed still an issue.



Thanks!

comment: Hi Will, I was going to re-try this one today but noticed that many directories are still missing on this server. This is an RHS2 job so I will re-visit this when we get done with the RH2 batch of testing. I made the mistake of trying my RHS2 jobs when I originally opened this Jira issue.

comment: [~rodriguez]: That is correct. Moving this ticket to "Selected Development" workflow since we have to wait until we test RHS2. I will keep it assigned to you for now.

comment: [~William.Kong]: I was able to successfully process this today. I got the DPVS and AFP files. No key errors or DB errors encountered. Moving this to "Done".
