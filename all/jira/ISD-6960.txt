comment: [~SamV2021] [~Shun.Kuwashima] When trying to search the account #534257119, there are several search results, but I cannot locate one that has an eStatement posted ( I clicked on each one of these). Did you use account #534257119 for this test? Here is a screenshot from the search result when I type in this account number:

comment: [~phoebe.george] I don't see acct 534257119 in the index file provided.
[~SamV2021] can you confirm?

I did not specifically look to ensure that account #534257119 is in the data file used for this test since I saw that this account did not use minor code S427.

Would you like me to retest with a file containingaccount #534257119 and have it posted to pilot?

I received confirmation that we will cancel this programming update. We will be billing for the work order though for the updates that you setup, even though we will not be releasing. I will be closing for invoicing.
