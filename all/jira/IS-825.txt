[~thomasY]please attach IS checklist.

Could you try to do a manual afp2pdf conversion using the afp file in the isd share folder and check if the output is normal or having a similar overlapping issue above?


author: eric.yan
comment: [~thomasY]

I did the conversion and pdf came out normal when converting on IS server. I'm working on identifying the cause of this.


author: eric.yan
comment: [~thomasY], [~Andrey.Kutsenko]

I found the dfa only applies the new form and disclosure to "s" job_type but not the others. I'm not sure if that's the cause of the overlapping issue. Could you correct the DFA and provide a new index file for testing?



new pseg: S1UTCU51, S1UTCU52

old pseg: S1UTCUD6, S1UTCUD7
