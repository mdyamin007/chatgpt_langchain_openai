comment: Hi [~barnetts]

Per your comment 71 in [https://app.na3.teamsupport.com/?TicketNumber=20653.]



_SANA_IAAdverseAction_122821_1.csv - does have*type*column by which we will detect the template._

I see 2 column with Type word involved:

*Applicant_PartyTypeID*

*Applicant_PartyTypeCD*



I don't see any column named only Type in the data file. Can you provide me snapshot where are you seeing it in IAAdverseAction data.

SANA has switched to a pipe delimited format. Can you please advise if this format removed the un-needed columns and provided samples.

Please see SANA feedback below.
* It looks like the only outstanding issue is on the 2nd page, "Your Credit Score";  the Credit Score should be 3 digits, no decimal. It was corrected on the DECLINE but not the COUNTER OFFER. Please see page 6 of the attached samples that were provided.

SANA has sent a new test file: test/SANA_MHAdverseAction_052022_1.csv.pgp / 15.21 kb (05/20/2022 10:45 PST)

Per SANA, 
In the new test file, The Reason1 field is now separated by periods. If possible, instead of capitalizing the first letter of each word, is it possible to capitalize only the first letter of the first word of each sentence/reason? This would be the same for Reason1, Reason2, Reason3, Reason4, B1 Score Factors, and S_Action5 fields too.

Since you are requesting on adding this as a new application. Can you please advise that the daily letter code will be 1,2,3 instead of 15,16,17.

Thanks, Barnett 


author: rony
comment: Hi [~barnetts]

Let's not use the 1,2,3 since those are existing even though for different applications. It's ok to use 15,16,17. Normally for daily type project we always use new letter code for new letters.

In reviewing the MH Adverse Action Notices, there is one change.

If the CRBR Date field in the data file is blank, then the Date: should not contain - - (dashes) on the notice. Attached is a sample for Application 1029609

Please see SANA feedback below.

Per SANA, 
It appears that maybe the logic that we asked for (to not map dashes in the date field if the CRBR date is blank) was not coded correctly. We are seeing several letters where the date is in the field but it is blank on the letter.  Can you please advise?
