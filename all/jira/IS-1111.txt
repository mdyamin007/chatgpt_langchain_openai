dt job id 139193-C13.03-V20124 - available on Pilot
Just checked with [~anwarh] as I do not see any updates on control file.
[~anwarh] will check and update

comment: [~rony], it looks like you only ran the Welcome letters, can you also run a cycle/job for therwcuMMDD_ytranq.txt file?

Thanks


author: rony
comment: Hi [~dyuen]

If I ran this ytranq file now, it will replace the previous entry from pilot that you are seeing now. I will need to ask new dt job id from PC to run with ytranq file.

But it's not necessary actually, I am assuring you infotrac will have all letters based on data files processed. Still if you think I should process ytranq file let me know.

Then, I will ask new dt job id from PC so that existing dt job id doesn't get replaced with ytranq file output.



Thanks

139204-C18.03-V20124 entry is with ytranq data and other entry is ywel data.





Thanks
