The data file only has 1099R and 1099Q records, should the account display logic only be applied to these two forms or all forms like 1098 as well?

I assume SSN masking is for all forms.

The sample is ready for review. Only data for 1099Q is available at the moment.

The sample is updated with SSN masking.



1099r data file is not available. The data file from the ticket is not a valid tax data file. A valid one should start with "T" on the first line. (See screenshot)
