Yes, and just to confirm, do we expect the send the first batch of 3PM email on 11/16 or 11/17?

We can do whichever day is best for ISD and code release.  I would just like to inform the client of which day so he can monitor.

I'll update the code tomorrow afternoon, and the first batch of 3PM email will be out on 11/17.

The email job has been scheduled for 3 PM daily. The existing default email job at 5 PM still applies.
