title: Enroll SMS and Email  - WECU - 13239
description: Eric/Tyler,



Rose notified me that WECU requested to allow user to enroll to receive both Email and SMS. I informed Rose that this is an enhancement that we will have to work on after Brisbane Migration. Currently we only allow user to choose either Email or SMS.


 *Tyler*: Can you add this to the enhancement list and prioritize for after Brisbane.



*Joe/Surekha:* Rose also mention that WECU was requesting for some customized report during Tuesdays call and we said we were going to review first. Do you have any info on that?



Thanks
 David
