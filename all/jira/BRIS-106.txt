title: ca-rtitan-pr-04: ISWK4 (Cloned VM) Setup/Configuration
description: *Summary:*

This is the cloned version of the ISWK4 (10.8.9.178).

*Specifications:*
 * New Server IP:
 ** {color:#FF0000}ca-rtitan-pr-03.infoimageinc.com{color}
 * Verify if RedTitan License works (i.e. Is RedTitan useable) ; If not, work with RedTitan to get a test license; Please ask if license is tied to CPU or VM; If tied to CPU, then we have to wait until 4/1 to test RedTitan.
 * Verify the system partition structure is ok. I asked Prem to only clone the C:\ Partition. I explicitly asked not to include the other partitions. If other partitions are needed, please let me (Will K.) know so that I can document this and request Prem too make the adjustments.
 * Also, please help me verify that the user accounts are setup correctly as well; (i.e. We want to make sure Neil/DP can run jobs

comment: [~premraj.patil]: Change the name from ca-redtitan-pr-04 to ca-rtitan-pr-04 based on the 15byte limitation issue on Windows that you just reported.

Please update DNS as well.

comment: Per meeting clarification last week and the updated Brisbane server list. We will NOT be using the "cloned" version of the ISWK servers. All of the physical ISWK Menlo servers will be physically to Brisbane.
