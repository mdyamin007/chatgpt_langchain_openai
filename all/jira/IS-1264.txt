From the team support ticket comment 17, it says that they received a new rate sheet to be used instead. The attached rate sheet is the one they initially sent. I wanted to confirm that the rate sheet to use is the one attached in comment 17.

Sample attached:
[^clcudla_04_SAMPLE.pdf]
The sample for the welcome letter, WL001, was unable to be attached on jira, so the sample named "clcuwl_001_SAMPLE.pdf" was placed in the folder:/ac-secure-share/ac/barnett

DPVS attached:
[^clcuwla120.print]Please print the entire IS file. The file is "clcuwla120.is.afp"
[^clcudla119.print]Please print pages 9-14 for the file named "clcudla119.is.afp"

[~Igor.Khosid]Providing the same note from the last time this rate sheet was updated: 
Please request LASER to print samples to make sure the new full page images can be printed with acceptable quality since this is an image update.
