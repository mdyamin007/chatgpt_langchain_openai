comment: [~thomasY]: Please roll this code to parallel (if you have not done so already) and ask DP to test. Per the description of work, no parallel is needed but we need DP to verify the changes are ok. If is it ok, I would like this project released no later than 11/30/2021. I will update this ticket w/ a live date of 11/30/2021.
