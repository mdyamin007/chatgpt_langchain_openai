title: OSCU - StmtPDFi Conversion to AFP2PDF Python [InHse]
description: Update existing processing script to no longer use PDFi tool to create pdf.
 Instead use afp2pdf.py program with index_build_multicore option for ALL statement related apps.
 The smaller daily notice jobs can use the current index_build options.

All the zip file, pgp encryption, index file contents, and PDF file naming convention must remain exactly the same original specifications.

Please ensure the standard SOP on the directory structure must be followed: 
 ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/pdf, ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/zip, ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/work is followed.
 Also, clear the folder directory folder before each processing. We do NOT want to accumulate previous runs.

The current program should support checking total PDF counts verification to make sure the expected pdf matches the total number for pdfs generated; If not, incorporate this standard verification logic

DT_JOB_ID:
 133572-C00.01-V21052

Processing Scripts to modify:
 oscums2_process.sh

Data Files to use:
 OSCU_20210430_Monthly_Statement.xml.zip



*NOTE*: This job runs on RH2 server. Since we are migrating from RH2 server to RHS, please test ALL job_sel options to ensure RHS can run with error messages in the processing log files.

comment: [~anwarh]: I noticed that isisdisk_daily.sh has a special condition for oscums2 for pdf archival. Please remove the logic from isisdisk_daily.sh and convert this to use our standard afp2pdf.py program.

comment: Hi [~William.Kong],

Parallel ID: 20221022172957
 production cycle: 09/30

Data files:
 /z/dsi_pdfi_testing/oscums2/data/OSCU_20220930_Monthly_Statement.xml.zip

old zips: /z/dsi_pdfi_testing/oscums2/old/
 new zips: /z/dsi_pdfi_testing/oscums2/new/

Notes:
 * You can't remove isisdisk logic for this, because it merges accounts from two different apps by sorting and suppressing.
 ** But moved it from pdfi to e job option inside isisdisk_daily.sh
 * Rony is also working on another change in the isisdisk in IS-418
 * Not sure how it worked before but the script 'oscu_pdfi_zip2.pl' was calculating total size of pdf as 15GB (before zipping)
 ** If I do that in rhs, it fails (when you try to unzip any of the file) because I think zip can not be larger than 4GB
 ** Changed to back to 4GB
 * afp2pdf has no option to suppress, neither are in papyrus if you use groupindex. So manually deleting those accounts using another script.

Thanks,
 Anwar

comment: [~anwarh]: Please restore the original oscu_pdfi_zip2.pl code. I was able to use rhs server and zip without issue and will result in less zip files for client to download. I really don't want to increase the number of zip files with the afp2pdf logic. The following screenshot is what I did in parallel but invoking the original production version of the script:

!image-2022-10-26-11-58-24-211.png!



I checked the number of zip files and down to 2 zip files instead of 7. Parallel zip file size is 4.1GB compared to production 3.9GB which believe is an acceptable increase with the new afp2pdf change:



the following is the command showing the difference between the parallel original zip script vs your version that I renamed to zip.org folder:

ls -lhtr /z/pdf_afp/oscu/oscums2/zip /z/pdf_afp/oscu/oscums2/zip.orig

!image-2022-10-26-12-02-54-614.png!



Can you restore the code and re-run the job so I can pass this along with QA?



In the meantime, I'm still struggling to see what I can do to help QA team to compare the pdf files. The PDF compare is complaining a lot of differences, but visually it is not big deal. This is mainly due to the header bar tiny color difference and the gradient header bar graphics. I don't believe there is anything you can do to address this issue at this time. So for now, please re-run again.

comment: [~William.Kong], It can create zip fine, but I can't unzip. I just generated new zip file with the original code here /z/pdf_afp/oscu/oscums2/zip/
Can you try? 



author: william.kong
comment: my apologies [~anwarh]! Your assessment of the larger 4GB assessment is correct. I forgot that zipping greater than 4GB is correct but not unzipping. I've been tweaking and testing on a pdf size specification and will inform you what the correct value is while you finish up the other PDFi conversion project for the other apps.

comment: Another thing I forgot to add, the isisdisk_daily.sh changes are merged with IS-418 changes.
Depending on which one goes first, we might need to remove the other one's changes.

Strangely, the Parallel pdf & txt index file directory size is less than production, but yet, we create more zip files than production.

Please use the following updated scripts:



Updated the following script to improve performance to use perl function -s instead of stat linux command.

Reduced the zipFileSize file size down to5200000000 bytes.

Use JPEGQuality of 35 instead of the default 50. This compresses the PDF file a little and not affect quality too much.

Can you re-test later this week using the most current production file (i.e. Oct 31, 2022) cycle since we should be getting that production file today.



Per [~terrencet]assessment as well, please use S1OSCUF1.300 for e option in the DFA. This resource file is smaller. Let's also hope this will improve the zipping as well too.

New archival in : /z/pdf_afp/oscu/oscums2/zip/
Thanks

comment: [~anwarh]: Sorry! One last request. Can you change the zipFileSize to11000000000 instead of5200000000

[williamK@rhs2 oscums2]$ diff oscu_pdfi_zip2.pl /home/test/master/oscu_pdfi_zip2.pl
78c78
< $zipFileSize=11000000000;
---
> $zipFileSize=5200000000;



Now with Terrence's suggestion to use a different resource to decrease the individual PDF size, we can now increase the zip size. This should reduce the number of zip files to 3 instead 6 zip files.

comment: Hi, [~William.Kong], yes, it generates 3 files now. Please check again in: /z/pdf_afp/oscu/oscums2/zip/. Thanks

[~Igor.Khosid]/[~Andrey.Kutsenko]: Please resume QA this week. Files are in:

ca-unittest-pr-02:/d/pdf_compare/oscums2_prod/

ca-unittest-pr-02:/d/pdf_compare/oscums2_parallel/



Bear in mind, b/c the headings are in dynamic location and the color is slightly different, you may run into the same issue where all PDF are reporting most documents are different.



I even created a small test configuration:

/d/pdf_compare/oscums2_wk.json

comment: [~Igor.Khosid]/[~Andrey.Kutsenko] : Would you be able to find time to review this particular QA request. We have 3 more projects to complete Phase I including this one. We are targeting to wrap up Phase I of this project next week before Thanksgiving so that we can shutdown RH2 server.

[~Andrey.Kutsenko]: When you work on this, please review my comment above. There will be+alot+ of differences due to the dynamically located header where the color is slightly off. Please don't hesitate to reach out to me on this particular application if needed. Thanks!

comment: QA is completed.
 note: Parallel files look better. Differences in the final report files are mainly due to the background image on the first page.
