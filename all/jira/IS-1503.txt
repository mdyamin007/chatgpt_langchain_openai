In SOW, letter index => 030 and 031 are not included in idcudla. please update the SOW. Those letter are set up as IDCU ARM letters.


author: dyuen
comment: [~zhuoxinT], SOW updated to reflect Payoff letter to be 030.

Thanks


author: JIRAUSER11101
comment: Hi [~dyuen] 
I am working on adding this letter to idcudla.
I found out that the existing paperless process for idcudla is checking on the data file.
if there is "email" field for that account, then we suppress it.
But for DL_GAP, we don't have that on data. Are we going to skip it?
Please advise.
Thanks


author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~zhuoxinT], I've passed your questions along to IDCU. Pending response.

Thanks


author: billr
comment: [~zhuoxinT] [~dyuen]

Client responded:

Sorry about the delay in response. I will alter the existing file to include the Email field for suppression. I will update the file and have a new sample out to the Test FTP by End of day tomorrow at the latest.


author: JIRAUSER11101
comment: [~billr] [~dyuen] 
Sample will be affected.
I need more time to test with the new data file.


author: billr
comment: [~zhuoxinT] [~dyuen]

Client has uploaded the test file and provided the following information:

Here is the latest test file for gap letters. I added the email field. We also noticed that the job was only finding person accounts and org accounts were left blank. I corrected this and made a small change to the column headers now instead of FirstName and LastName it is just FULLNAME to make merging with Orgs cleaner.

Let me know if you need anything else.

I dropped the file on the SFTP in the test folder

IDCU_DL_GAP_090822


author: JIRAUSER11101
comment: [~billr], there are issues with the data.
 For paperless option, we still need a column "DEL_METHOD" with either "Paper" or "eMail" like other letters in Daily notice.
 If "Paper", customer will get paper, enotice and archival.
 if "Email", customer will get enotice and archival only.

Also, the naming convention for csv file is different.
 the first data file: IDCU_DL_GAP_*MMDDYYYY*.csv
 but the new data :IDCU_DL_GAP_*090822*.csv
 and this csv file should be in the IDCU_DL_MMDDYY.7z with all other letters when its live.

Here's the screen shot on the other letter.

Following up with the client.


author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~zhuoxinT], I got a new test file and it should have the DEL_METHOD field. Let me know if it looks OK. If it does, when can I expect samples?

Also are you able to provide a new timeline so that I can present it to IDCU?

author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~zhuoxinT], please see following feedback from IDCU:

A quick update on the review process. It was noticed that the original sample letter did not have the appropriate signature at the bottom and I've attached a new sample letter with the proper signature. If we could get it updated that would be great!

A second thing that is more of a clarification there was concern where the samples were in black and white where the actual letters were supposed to be in Color. This is just because they are samples correct?

Let me know if you have any questions.

[^GAP Insurance Payoff LetterUpdated.docx]

------------

Can you confirm the question about the notice being printed in color v b/w? I would think we provided the samples in b/w because they're samples. The production notices are printed in color, correct?

Thanks!


author: JIRAUSER11101
comment: [~dyuen] 

1. We can update the signature. If client can provide the tiff file of the signature, that would be great.

2. This is printing in b/w right now. We need more time if they want to change the logo to color. Also, we need to know which logo they want to use. And all option(print, estmt, archival) need to be in color?

Thanks


author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~zhuoxinT], I just realized this is a new letter. Is this the only letter right now that is set up to print b/w while the other letters (in production) are being printed in color? Or are all the current DLs being printed in b/w right now?

Thanks


author: JIRAUSER11101
comment: [~dyuen] 
All the letter in idcu DLs (idcudla) are being printed in b/w right now. And I used the same logo on this new letter. that's why it is b/w.

Can you provide the column header names?

Thanks

Thanks!

comment: Ready for customer review.


author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~zhuoxinT], IDCU responded with the following question:

"I have a new question. Would it be difficult for me to add the acct# to the file and have you guys add it to the index file for our archive process. the reasoning behind this is if a member has multiple vehicle loans it would be easier to sort and archive by account rather than member number. Let me know what you and your team think"

Can you confirm if this can be done? If it can, will it incur extra programming hours?

Thanks


author: JIRAUSER11101
comment: Hi [~dyuen]
If client can add another column to the data file. This can be done easily.
no programming hours needed to add.

Thanks


author: dyuen
comment: Thanks [~zhuoxinT]. I asked IDCU to send an updated test file with the acct# column.


author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~zhuoxinT], an updated test file just came in. The file should include the new field/column for the account#. Can you provide a new index file?

naming convention:

 - File name and File: DL_GAP_*MMDDYYYY*.csv (TS #31591 comment#21, planning on matching it to the rest of the daily's ie.. DL_GAP_MMDDYYYY.csv)

I think the file they sent just for testing right now. Please use the correct naming convention when its live.
new archival sample: [^dl2_09212022_1_idcu.7z]
column information : fullname, member number, pdf_filename, idcu_number, description, document_name, notice_date, account_number, employee
see sample from archival index:[^index_updated.txt]


author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~zhuoxinT], I believe that's the case as well. I forwarded the updated samples and made a note for them to remember to send the file in the agreed naming convention.

[^idcudla_sample_0921.pdf]


author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~zhuoxinT],

IDCU asked the following question:

When we get the archive files, they will be included in the dl2 with the other dailys. Will the gap be in their own zip with an index file inside of this or will it be separate?

Can you confirm?

Thanks!

Also adding following note from Zoom:

IDCUDLA has two archival zip,

dl1_${procdate}_$ENV\{g_segment}_${cid}.7z"; ### Adverse Action ZIP file

dl2_${procdate}_$ENV\{g_segment}_${cid}.7z"; ### All other letters ZIP file

the Gap letter will send with dl2 7z file


author: JIRAUSER11101
comment: [~dyuen] 
Will the gap be in their own zip with an index file inside of this or will it be separate?

No, gap will not be in their own zip. The Gap letter will be zipped up in dl2 zip file with other daily letters. only 1 index file for all daily letters in that zip file.

Thanks


author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~zhuoxinT], IDCU is requesting additional changes to the index file. Please review below and let me know if this can be done.

"Sorry about the long pause. I was trying to get everything figured out with onBase. I was hoping that you could make some last minuet changes with the format of the index file of the Gap letters. the format we were hoping for was

first name, last name, company name, mem #, file name, Idcu_number, doc type hardcoded(1531), DL_GAP, DL_GAP, Account #, Current Emp, Notice date.

this will differ from the existing point in that we added 2 columns one for company name that will be blank if its a person account, and added column 7 which we would like to be hard coded as 1531.

we also split full name into first and last

we also rearraigned the last three columns from notice, acct number current emp to acct# current emp and notice date.

Ive sent a new test file to the test ftp. if you could talk to your team about these changes and get me back a sample index zip similar to what we will be getting in the prod level i would greatly appreciate it.

Thank you and let me know what you need to make this easier."

Thanks!


author: JIRAUSER11101
comment: [~dyuen] 
We can hardcode the doc type into the index file.


Two questions:
1. for the Employee column, it have to be the last column. This is how all other daily letters doing right now. If we have to change it, it would take more time to modify the whole script and test.
first name, last name, company name, mem #, file name, Idcu_number, doc type hardcoded(1531), DL_GAP, DL_GAP, *Account #, Notice date, Current Emp*.

2. How can we determine if the account is company or personal account? If it is company account, it still have firstname and lastname or not?

Thanks

Check with client if we can stick with this column sequence.

or they want to switch the whole column:
"","AMY","BROWN","1420669","1420669_10032022_DL_GAP_0017.pdf","16","1531","DL_GAP","DL_GAP","728192212","10/03/2022","N"

author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~zhuoxinT], IDCU responded with the following:

Just have the Name for the company account in the first_name column would be great. that way the index looks like "Company_Name", "", "member_number" etc

Thanks


author: JIRAUSER11101
comment: [~dyuen] 
sorry, one more question. Client added the company_name column before. now they want the company name in the first name column.
Do we need to keep the company_name column?


first name, last name, *company name,* mem #, file name, Idcu_number, doc type hardcoded(1531), DL_GAP, DL_GAP,Account #, Notice date, Current Emp.

Thanks


author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~zhuoxinT], you can disregard. We're just waiting on approval now.

Per IDCU:

"Im so sorry my brain is fried on this project. The way the files are now is perfect. it has first name last name and company name.... i was trying to lump it in with the change to the code for the spacing.

You can disregard this is how they should look. Tell you programming team they are doing a great job and sorry for any confusion. I will get this sample out to the onBase guy and work on getting them approved.

Sorry again for the confusion. "

author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~zhuoxinT], IDCU provided an update:

"Had a break through with OnBase. One final adjustment to the index file. Making it almost exactly like the daily letters.

First_Name, Last_Name, Company_name, Member#, file name, hardcode "INS GAP Letter" instead of 1531, DL_GAP, Notice date, account#, employee.

this is different in that the hardcoded value is changed from 1531 to INS GAP Letter, the second DL GAP column is removed. date and account number are switched.

this is the exact format as the other daily letters save for the hardcoded value.

If its not too much trouble to ask for a final sample with these changes on the index file."

Are you able to accommodate this change?

Thanks!


author: JIRAUSER11101
comment: [~dyuen]

I can make the changes.

What about the IDCU_NUMBER column? Do we keep it or not? Client didn't mention it above.
 first name, last name,company name,mem #, file name, *IDCU_number*, doc type('INS GAP Letter'), DL_GAP, Notice date,Account #, Current Emp.

Thanks


author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~zhuoxinT], IDCU confirmed to leave the 16 in its place.

Per IDCU: "Yes leave the 16 in its place. sorry forgot to add it to the example"
