comment: Inside /home/meteor/certs directory, file certificate.cert

Replace this file on pd-pilot01 as well as webapp-prod03, webapp-prod04 on a meeting with NCR as well as a SAML SSO Client such as NECU, so that we can make the changes simultaneously while testing for expected sso results.

1. First have client send SAML SSO request to test expecting a successful login without changes on InfoIMAGE or NCR's side.
2. Then InfoIMAGE replaces certificate.crt with new certificate on both webapp-prod03, webapp-prod04 and have client test expecting a failed login request.
3. Then NCR replaces certificate on their end to test expecting a successful login with changes on both sides.

This is the new yearly required SAML Signing Certificate update that needs to be done.
