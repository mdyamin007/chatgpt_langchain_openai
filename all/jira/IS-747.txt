comment: Hi [~phoebe.george]
As per internal call, i am searching here the logo. But can't find. Can you re-attach the logo?
And, is there any background image, you need to share with us like the attached file?



author: phoebe.george
comment: [~mousumiS] [~diegof] 

Attaching logos and gradients TIFF images; this will be used as Embedded Resources, to replace current 'preprint'.

Grey backer is used for print; b/w backer is used for PDF archival and eStmt (if applicable).

Also, new stock code = 3704 (I'll update the SOW).


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~mousumiS] Adding B/W logos also.


author: mousumis
comment: Hi,
This is the 1st sample of SSCUCC1. As the datafile is so large, so we have generated sample with small one. We have attached the small one. Please check.
*Note:*
Total FEES Charged is not handled as we need exact mapping from client.
We are counting backer in the page count coding. 
Gray backer is not provided for print. So, for now, we are using b/w backer. We will attach the gray one on next cycle. 
We are now using gradient at front in all subsequent pages.  
If all value is zero or no tag is available for INTEREST CHARGE CALCULATION, then we keep this box with blank information.
We have used the bank logo in the coupon part which is different from other apps. 
As per mapping, we have moved the REWARDS POINT part to the next page.
If you see all the values are zero in rewards point, then informing you that these come from csv file. CSV file has zero. 

Thank you
Sumi

comment: Hi [~phoebe.george, [~diegof]
I have attached the second sample with feedbacks. The sample is generated with small datafile. I have attached here the datafile too. I will also provide sample with large data in client pickup and let you know after attaching. 

N.B.
For the fees description, we have displayed description. If description tag is not available then displayed from custom description tag.
Message manager setup is done
We have kept 11 digits for account number and 9 digits for minimum amount in OCR line.

author: phoebe.george
comment: [~rumanb] [~rony] [~mousumiS] Please proceed with the following changes for the print:
 # Remove background gradient - this will resolve the missing logo and the white text issue.
 # Please shift the coupon information on the right-hand side (along with current OCR placement); OPS estimated to shift 9/16" to the right, but please check existing setup to mirror placement so it does not show through window as in QA's previous comment/screenshot.
 # Shift location of sequence #'s up - reference Gnana's previous comment screenshot.

This should address all issues reported by QA. Please provide updated DPVS as soon as possible once completed.

Separately, please also update the print processing to use "member number" (as per the zoom chat with Diego), to mirror Electronic. Once done, please re-create samples as well tied to the list I attached to the ticket yesterday.

about the gray line we are not sure. When we convert indiv afp on our side we don't see this problem . Also there should be gradient in estatement sample.
