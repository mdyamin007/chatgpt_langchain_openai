title: SNFB - [34621][pvt] Remove verbiage on statements missing check images
description: On our statements that are missing check images, you currently print the text"We apologize. In our quality verification process we noticed some of your images are missing. We will provide the images shortly." at the top. We would like to stop having that added when images are missing. We are no longer pre-emptively printing these off and mailing them to all customers missing them.
