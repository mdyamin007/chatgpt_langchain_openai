comment: [~dyuen] - There are 2 boxes with shades in daily letter 007 and 012. I have attached the screen shot of both. Do you want the shade of both to be increased? Also in 012 header box there is no boundary line. Should this be added?

Thanks!
Rukmani

comment: Hi [~rukmaniR], checking with Ron Davis. I believe it's only the headers, but I want to confirm.

Thanks!

comment: [~dyuen] - Any update from Ron on this?

Thanks!

comment: Hi [~rukmaniR],

I confirmed with Ron that only the greyscale headers need to be updated. No need to update the other boxes. As for DL012, there needs to be a border/boundary line.



Per Ron: "yes all grayscale header boxes should be increased from 25% grayscale to 50%, so the shading will match the increase requested for the DDA application. Once updated, can you please provide a test file that will have all the DL ltrs contained, so I can compare output of each to DDA output."



Thanks!

comment: Hi [~rukmaniR]please see following from OPS:

please see DL 007 below. I believe the customer was going for the 50% shading on all sectional headers? Shouldn't the top header match the grayscale shading of the bottom one? If so, programmer should enter same grayscale values for both areas. All daily Ltrs recently submitted for test have the same issue as below. Please advise

Please adjust 1st section header to match the second section header (lighter shade).

Thanks


author: JIRAUSER11100
comment: [~dyuen] - Please refer to my comment 1 in which I have asked if both has to be updated and the response in comment 5 was only header has to be updated. Header has 50% shade and the box has 20%. If 20% shade is good please let me know. 

Thanks!
Rukmani

comment: [~dyuen] - Shading is not increased by 50% from the original. Original was 20% and now it's 50%. Attached the screenshots.

[~rukmaniR], per attached email, we will not be proceeding with the shading updates. The original setting will be kept.

Please cancel Jira.

Thanks!
