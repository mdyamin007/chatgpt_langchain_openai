title: DACB - [25100][pvt] Duplicate Images
description: IS Assessment:



Implement logic to avoid duplicate Images.

We do not have the following logic in place, but it sounds like we need to add it:

Due to an account can have the same deposit slip with the same amount on the same day. The image is overwritten each other if it cannot be reference using sequence number.

dacb_820010804_11052020_50.00_0_F.tif



Example above, two deposit slips but the image have the same name (see highlighted red).

The missing deposit slip showed up in the statement was due to having an identical account number, date, amount, and check serial number which is 0. This caused the program to pull the duplicate image.

To avoid this scenario when extracting the image for repository, program to check if any image with check 0 has the same account, date, and amount. If yes, the program will increment the check serial number from 0 to 1 and so on and up to 9 max.

At time of formatting document, the program will continue to search base on account, date, amount, sequence number. If no image found, and if the check serial number is 0, then check if this image has been referenced before with this account. If yes, reference the next incremental check serial number.

This update will require time for testing. We will compare cripple report to ensure the check image is referenced correctly.
