comment: [~jharvey] The index file was posted on pilot, however none of the accts actually posted because they don't exist in our database yet. We do have an enotice acct creation flag that we can enable so that new accts can be created via enotice postings. Should we enable this and if so, should it be temporary or permanent? Also if permanent, should we also enable this on production?

The client is out of the office until Wednesday. I will let him know these accounts are not able to be viewed on pilot and ask about enabling the account creation flag.
