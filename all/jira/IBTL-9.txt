title: RHS:  Test opttechsort utility
description: -opttechsort utility is no longer compatible. The latest version is back in year 2002.-

-We need to look into rewriting the opttechsort utility with a replacement program.-



Got opttechsort utility to run. I need someone to help verify that it functions correctly by comparing the results form bb-rhs with Menlo Park rhs.

comment: I was able to get opttechsort to work now after I installed this:



Ubuntu:

sudo apt-get install -y lib32ncurses5

Centos:

sudo yum install -y glibc32



Please assign someone to get this taken of.

comment: [~hkhosravani]: Currently opttechsort is not installed in the menlo Preprocessing servers, so we do not need test the bb-preprocessing## servers.



Please save your test case. I'm going to be install rhs2 and rh2 in the coming weeks. It should be compatible.
