comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] Please add hours for this job. It looks like it's a new enotice, so it should be 2 hrs. Thanks.

Could you please download the SOW and attach it to the ticket since we don't have access to sharepoint?

Thanks.

comment: [~rifat.mahmud]- The CU is requesting that these notices be placed under a separate tab on eStatements titled "Daily Notice - Arm Notices". Please let me know if you have any questions.

For this setup, our understanding is that, it will be configured as a *enotice*type statement with a new prefix. The archival will be 4 months as configured currently for enotices. So, can you tell me what the new prefix would be for this configuration? Currently there is 1 prefix configured for enotices, _dlc_.

Also, about the client request to place these notices under a separate tab with different title, we could not support this feature. But there is an alternative, if we configure ARM notices as a regular eStatements like loan or mortgage, with a new statement type(stmt_type), then we can make this request happen. Then, we have to post ARM notices as a regular eStatements and not as enotices.

[~Tin.Chak]Let me know your thought.

Thanks

comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] As Azhar suggested, we can posted as an eStatement instead of eNotice so we can separate out into another statement type. This also means that there will be another email content they need to manage.

comment: [~jahid.hasan] Fyi I released new index file prefix ar1 to production since I had other new prefixes to release for other apps. Please add the letter code/description to doc_desc, thanks.

comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima]I have added type code in doc_desc of production schema. Since conf files of all environments are updated with new prefix and also db is updated, can we mark this ticket done?
