title: 18826 - INHS / WFCU - Update Cookie Enabling Verbiage
description: WFCU is asking us to update the help page that is displayed on Hypercube when cookies are disabled. David has agreed to do this inhouse.



We need to verify the instructions provided by WFCU to make sure everything is valid. Then make the update and release to Production.



logout.html - found in hypercube folder
 * client > views > shared > logout > logout.html
 * Once tested on lower env, make sure to let AC/IM know about the update when prepping for release onto production.
