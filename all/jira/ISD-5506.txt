One ticket is fine. Do we also need to update the logo on the eStatement site itself?


Thanks,
Tai

Can I get the logo in .png? Thanks.


author: kdishroon
comment: Hi Mac,

We typically ask for tif from the client; I have never asked for png before, and she is ooto 10/22 through 10/26. Can you use eps?

Hi Keri, I converted the image using eps. The new logo is ready on pilot for client approval.

This has been moved to stage, ready for QA.



1. Check if the logo appears as the new logo on the site.

Can you test the site logo first? The site logo is not dependent on the applications used. Hold off on the applications. For ELOC and Loan, I think we are still waiting for those.

You can test with this account # 502136

QA is completed, the updated logo looks good.

I've verified posting on Stage for Index file[^wtcu_700968_afp_enotice_10202021.txt]

Please attach IS checklist if needed.
