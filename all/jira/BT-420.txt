The barcode in letters contains 29 digits. We require 31 so that in can be decoded.

The last 2 digits are DP, Delivery Point. It is often missing in mailing addresses and, as far as I know, we usually put the last two digits of the street address there.

Sorry, please use these as the sample.
101 and 102:[^vwcudlb1224.2o1.pdf]
103:[^vwcudlb1124.2o1.pdf]

regarding toBT-420
[^vwcudlb112.sam.pdf][^vwcudlb122.sam.pdf]these two are just the sample pdf. Not the actual print file. That's why it has incomplete barcode.
