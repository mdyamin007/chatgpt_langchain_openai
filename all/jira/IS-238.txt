Eric,

Please provide PR ID and move project into the QA folder


author: dyuen
comment: [~eric.yan], why do the letters in your PDF sample look/have different verbiage than the template that RWCU provided? Also you have asterisks in your samples whereas RWCU has bullet points/dots. Please advise.

Lastly, what is the letter code for this new letter(s)? I need to add them to the SOW.

Thanks



[~Igor.Khosid], FYI

I've updated the sample.

* The asterisks are updated to bullet points.
* Do you mean the verbiage difference by the format like line spacing etc? The format needs to be adjusted in order to fit in one page.
* The letter code is 017.

comment: [~eric.yan], I'm referring to this... The left is Letter 1 template, the right is the PDF samples.

comment: [~eric.yan], please see feedback from RWCU:



I have an update to the letters. I have attached them to the ticket. Can we run samples with these new letters?

Also, can these be printed on the letterhead such as in these samples?

Here are some questions and comments from the business owner:

FORMATTING
 - What's the font type on this? Are there other options?
 - Font size, is there a way to make it all consistent (right now looks like the borrower name & address is much smaller than the rest
 - Is there a way to have the left margin all line up? Right now the date, address block and start of letter have a different starting place (alignment is all disjointed)
 - Formatting on letter version 2 with the sub bullets is all off.

CONTENT
 - In review the letter template I sent, the variable data field
[SBA Loan #]funded on[Loan Funded Date]probably needs to be slightly modified to: SBA # (PPP loan)[SBA Loan #]funded on[Loan Funded Date]

That way it's more clear what loan we're talking about and what the # is referring to.

* I changed it to Ariel font for better spacing.
* The font size of address block is fix across all letters, while the content font size could be changed. If client wants, I could reduce the content's font to match the address block.
* Left margins has been aligned.
* Letter content also updated with new templates.
* Please provide the letter head, including logo and footer, in 300 ppi tiff image.
