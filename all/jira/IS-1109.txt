Hi Thomas, checking with Daphne on this. If she doesn't know, I'll check with client on Tuesday. Please let me know if I can still request print samples or need to wait for answer to your question? Thank you!

comment: [~thomasY] I noticed that all 7 accts in the index file have leading 0s and our enotice acct creation flag is off, therefore the accts were not posted on stage. There are no existing accts on production with leading 0s, so I'm not sure if this is expected. Can you confirm? If so, I can enable acct creation on stage and repost the index file so that QA can verify the notices.


author: thomasy
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima]I'll remove the zeros from my end.

comment: Thanks [~thomasY]

[~gthillaivel] The warnings are because the acct number does not exist on our stage db. For this one time I enabled enotice acct creation and reposted the index file, please check again.

[~thomasY][~Andrey.Kutsenko]
[~Bryanl]--The latest print samples attached above by Andrey have only email update and not the phone # update.


author: bryanl
comment: [~thomasY] [~gthillaivel]

Hi Thomas, can you take a look at the IRF (first page of print samples that Andrey provided)? What information do we need to change to get print samples for phone number update (DL041)?



Mike from OPs said "it looks like the other file is in the 4.2o1 file so I will print that as well and it is in the IS Box." but Gnana said this second batch still has no phone number update. Thanks!
