comment: The jobs were stuck, so I went to the console and checked list waiting, list running.

Saw that one of them was stuck in list running.
Removed it with command - remove pid.

Then the second one ran successfully.
After I created a run.bat file inside schedule folder.

It had this command:
call exec.bat proofing action:exec orgName:sccu userName:system file://10.8.9.23/Input/I3/process-files/sccu/proofing_index_me2128_12302019172008.txt

And then I ran it.

I got the command from the Database, p_job record, added call exec.bat in front.
