Thanks!


author: amirr
comment: Hi keri,

So we will get an undeliverable report from ISD like this: apcu_<app>__undeliverable_<mmddyyyy>_<hhmmss>.txt.pgp, right?

What should be the location for this undeliverable report?



Thanks,

Rahat


author: kericapote
comment: {color:#555555}[~amirR] Yes, undeliverable report name is correct.{color}

{color:#555555}The location will be:/d/SECURE3/Usr/APCU/bounceback{color}


author: kericapote
comment: [~amirR] [~rony] [~TunA] Can you please provide sample date for customer?

Thanks!


author: amirr
comment: We can submit samples by 25th October. Let me know if you need the sample sooner than this.



Thanks,


author: kericapote
comment: [~amirR] Live date is 11/10. Can you provide sample any sooner as I don't think that leaves enough time for QA and parallel.

Thx!


author: kericapote
comment: [~amirR] [~rony] Please let me kn ow if you can provide sample the week of the 18th. Thanks


author: rony
comment: Sorry [~kericapote]we can't provide it before 25th. I think qa and parallel will not need much time. But if it is, then we can skip QA and directly move to parallel.


author: kericapote
comment: [~amirR] [~rony] Checking in on the sample due today.


author: amirr
comment: Hi Keri,

comment: One questions:


 # If there is "Do Not Mail" in address, should we remove it and use the account for print?


author: kericapote
comment: [~amirR] I'm not sure how there can be a do not mail in the address as we create this letter from the bounce back report. Please advise.


author: amirr
comment: We are getting the address from a saved c1bmcok file. I am concerned about that c1bmcok file might contain "Do not mail" in it's address.


author: kericapote
comment: [~amirR] [~rony] the samples are missing the code above the address block as requested on the SOW. Please add and resend ASAP.

Thanks


author: amirr
comment: Please see the sample attached.

comment: I think for naming conflict, if you click the latest sample then the older one gets downloaded.



I am attaching the sample again with different name. Use this one.

comment: [~amirR] the customer is saying it is because the files are not zipped and encrypted (see the email I forwarded you from APCU for details). Please provide samples the way we will send them in production - zipped and encrypted.



Thanks,


author: kericapote
comment: [~amirR] Operations is saying they don't have thatPproc ID. Is that the correct dpvs?


author: amirr
comment: I am attaching the encrypted archival sample. It is same as they would get from production.

Keri - The print samples don't haveEqual housing and the NCUA symbols on them (bottom of the page).

the preprint3346 has it on them [^APCU 3346 paper.pdf]

Please advise it should be there? please ask for the new set of samples with these symbols and also send it for the client approval. (approved samples dont have these symbols on them).

Hi Amir,

Didi you had a chance to check on the printing issue?


author: amirr
comment: Hi,



Updated sample and corresponding DPVS is attached. (new sample is without stock code as the stock code is in preprint)



Igor: The printing issue has been solved. Please create another print sample.

QA is completed


author: anwarh
comment: Hi [~kericapote],

Please provide the parallel form.


author: kericapote
comment: [~anwarh] parallel is on Team Support 24189.


author: william.kong
comment: [~kericapote]: What is the expect live date for this project? November 10, 2021 is past due. Please advise so that we know when this needs to get this active parallel completed.


author: kericapote
comment: [~William.Kong] I need this live ASAP:. We are totally late. It just failed parallel so I am reaching out to Tun to research.


author: william.kong
comment: [~kericapote]: We cannot release code until we get this passed from parallel. Once it is passed in parallel, please let us know. In the meantime, I'm going to ask Rahat/Anwar to submit transfer form to this ticket so that Peter / YaMee can assist with code release.

[~anwarh]: Per my skype message, please try to get a hold of [~amirR]to submit transfer form. I couldn't get a hold of him since it is after 12pm PST via skype.


author: anwarh
comment: Hi [~William.Kong],

Attached transfer form:[^IS-416 Transfer Form.docx]
Code is in: /d/is/cvs/xfer/anwarH

Thanks


author: kericapote
comment: [~William.Kong] [~Peter.Dang] [~yameelee] Parallel 24189 has passed. Please release code.  Also, who will trigger this job to run this time since it's based off the bounceback file we receive on the 10th of every month?

Thanks!


author: william.kong
comment: [~kericapote]: I'm checking with [~Peter.Dang]/[~yameelee]to see who can release the code.



Please advise what time do we need to set the scheduler to run on the 10th of each month. I tried skimming through the SOW but i cannot find it. Please advise if I missed it and what time on the 10th of each month it should run.

comment: Code has been released.

cron has not been set up yet.


author: william.kong
comment: [~kericapote]: On Monday, please find out what time we need to process on the 10th so that we can add this to the scheduler.


author: kericapote
comment: [~William.Kong] this job runs off the bounceback report generated on the 10th.  I'm not sure what time that generates so anytime after that should be fine.  




author: william.kong
comment: [~amirR]/ [~rony]: I believe all the issues are resolved. If so, please close this Jira ticket.


author: kericapote
comment: [~amirR] the client does not see this application appearing on InfoTrac Job Tracking. Please research.

Thanks!




author: william.kong
comment: [~kericapote]: This ticket is marked "Done" and closed. Please create a TeamSupport ticket. Rony will need to re-assign someone to work on this project as Rahat may not be providing support soon.
