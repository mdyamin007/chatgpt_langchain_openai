Could you update the script of UFCU DL (ufcudla) and Mortgage (ufcuml1) to process recursive, handling multiple files?



Prefix = ufcudla and ufcuml1

-------------------Per Tun---------------------------

Client dropped multiple files in bu/ folder. So Rogelio needsmanually put one file by one file to reprocess .



Can you modify script to process each file inside the bu/ folder,recursively?



In case if you don't know we normally call main $* at the end after main function end (reference: wtcu_dl_process.sh).

For lccu daily (lccudna_process.sh) we handled multiple data file for a single day. In this case after completing each data file process, we create a folder based on cycle(date) and segment of data file and move all processed files to that folder. To avoid too much folder being created we just deleted previous folder with current segment. Please advise you are good with it or not. We have already discussed with Tun on zoom channel , he is okay it and asked to check with DP if is there any difficulties.
