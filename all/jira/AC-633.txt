Refer to to the following smartsheet and update the rows that requires update of estmt_trac=y, infotrac='m' ONLY. The other items will need other dedicated resources to change the custom programming. I count 32 applications that meets this scenario to have the control files updated.

DP will need to work with PC & ISD to create DT_JOB_ID on Stage and verify the changes works. If so, update the Smartsheet with a status that Testing was Successful.



Once all successful, we can release this during mid-May or earlier.
