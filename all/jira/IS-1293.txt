Strange but It looks like the archival is already implemented for this letter in production. I didn't make any changes to the code.

Sample is in/d/ac-secure-share/ac/daphne/is-1293 folder.



Thanks

Thanks

Normally we provide only sample before/for client approval. After client approval we provide project, parallel id, dpvs, index file etc etc.

But any wayRWCUDL011.zip is in qa folder now.



Thanks

comment: [~rony], this is approved.

Per RWCU:

"Hi Daphne,

These look correct.

Tom"

Please confirm with [~billr]if this needs to go through parallel. If not, please confirm once code has been released.

Thanks

Please turn the story over to QA

[~gthillaivel] - FYI

Rony, I changed the workflow to Waiting for QA, did not realize Igor had asked you to turn the story over to QA. Let me know if I need to change it back.


author: igor.khosid
comment: [~billr] -To change the status in this case prerogative of the developers
I'm reverting to DSI
[~rony] - if you have done please turn it over to QA

comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid]

projectRWCUDL011.zip is in qa folder.

if you need data file/z/daily/rwcudlc/files/rwcuratepay0602.txt

I didn't need to do any change in the code. The codes are already in production. So no parallel id. As you see my first comment in this jira, it looks strange to me why this Jira was created of what is already implemented.



Anway attached is checklist.[^IS_293_Checklist.docx]





Thanks
