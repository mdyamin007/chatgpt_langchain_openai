Keri, YaMee - Are we using the same job type? ea1? I believe this type already exist . See below from DataTrac

Should we use "ea2" or you using the same type for both *ea1 and ea2*?

DataTrac - needs to be updated with the new Application and Version numbers for ea2.

YaMee - project exported to QA folder

YaMee - *did you provide the new resources to ISD?*

Please see attached >>>[^DataTrac_entry for ea2.pdf]and >>>[^QA folder_Project.pdf]

{color:#172b4d}*Unable to start testing - please confirm on Job type and resource to ISD*{color}

Hi Shun - did you have a chance to move code to stage?


author: yameelee
comment: [~Igor.Khosid], we are using ea2 for this job.

I have added to datatrac now and exported to QA.

I am using the same anchors as ea1 which is the account number and page number.

It looks like we only need one new resource, the rest are using old resources which I added to ISD JIRA. Some resources on PR_ID are not being used as they were just for the initial testing, I will remove them once we go LIVE.

Print samples failed. Logo and paper stock are missing on the samples.

Please fix it and request a new set of samples.


author: yameelee
comment: [~berezinez] This is a preprint. So if its not there that means laser did not use the preprint for the Laser prints. On the IRF form Keri did say to have preprint 3461. Please have Laser preprint with the correct paper stock.
