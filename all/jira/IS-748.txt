Attaching logos and gradients TIFF images; this will be used as Embedded Resources, to replace current 'preprint'.

Also, new stock code = 3705 (I'll update the SOW).

[https://app.smartsheet.com/sheets/XQVXWQJffjp392JMRf49gf9pHCPrcW8fM9V85m21]

I gave [DSI@infoimageinc.com|mailto:DSI@infoimageinc.com] access, and notified Diego to review as well so he can address and/or update DSI on the changes.

comment: [~tohidulI] PDF archival samples are APPROVED; SSCU was able to load these to their system successfully. 

There will be changes for mortgage statements from feedback and we will be providing an updated set of test files for new samples.

Also, I'm pending if the eStatement pilot posting is approved too, that's still in validation.

comment: [~Najoa] Thank you - I sent a zoom message too, but is it possible to use a more current data file for these samples, specific to either 2/21, 2/22 or 2/23 - this has more current data for CU to validate. Thanks!

comment: [~Najoa] As mentioned via zoom chat, we have received approval on the latest samples that you provided earlier today. Please move forward with preparing for final QA. As mentioned, I have already initiated the DPVS print samples and will attach scanned samples here.

[~Igor.Khosid] FYI that samples are approved. We are behind schedule on the original timeline based on what we discussed last week. I will be preparing the following items to attach here by tomorrow:
 # Mapping docs - [~diegof] Please confirm if updated in the location provided.
 # Approved samples

I will also complete updates on the SOW as well, but same link as provided in the description as well.

Thanks,

I think the dark logo issue is due to pseg image. I updated the dfa to use the tiff image instead of pseg.
