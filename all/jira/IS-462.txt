title: ALCU - [22744][pvt] Update New Excite Logo on Consumer Loan Bills
description: -------------------per Peter----------------------------

I found out the loan program is printing the log directly on. No need to have Wilson make create e-form. It is strange that the program is using e-form and also print the logo as well.

Loan applications:

Consumer Loan Statements (ML1),

LOC Loan Statements (ML2),

Mortgage Loan Statements (ML3) - 6 hours

Daily Notice: 3 hours.



Turnover to IS: 10/4/2021

Sample to client: 10/12/2021

Client approval: 10/14/2021

QA: 10/18/2021

Parallel: 10/20/2021

Nischala - client approved all samples, please provide index file
Also, wondering if you had a chance to send the new resources to ISD?



[~tye.wu@infoimageinc.com] [~Shun.Kuwashima]

Tye,
Did you have a chance to upload the new resources on stage?




author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~Igor.Khosid], I believe Tye already uploaded resources per his ISD ticket. Let us know if there are any issues with how the statements look after we receive the index file


author: nischala.manjunath
comment: [~Igor.Khosid] - The index file is ml1_20210925_1_20211012_1418_alcu.txt. It should be autoposted.
