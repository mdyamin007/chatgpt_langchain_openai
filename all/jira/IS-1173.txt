Rony - please attach an updated pdf with the Minimum Balance Required: $100.00


author: rony
comment: Hi [~berezinez] [~MattL]

I don't think we need updated pdf. There are 2 templates one for *note1* and other for *note2*.

For note1 minimum balance is 1000 and for note 2 it is 100.

You can check some of last customers of previously provided sample to see the 100.

Unfortunately, the programs that [~rony] updated is no longer exist in parallel environment. Because Rony prepared to released last time, but the client requested to hold for releasing.

We need to wait until Rony come back to tell us, where he hold the program.

Thanks
