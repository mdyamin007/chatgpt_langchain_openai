title: UFCU - [24769][pvt][in-house] DL application to process multiple files
description: For DL Application only



IS,

Could you update the script of UFCU DL (ufcudla) and Mortgage (ufcuml1) to process recursive, handling multiple files?

Prefix = ufcudla and ufcuml1

CRON - RHS2

56 07 * * 1-7 . export dp_printer="tx_dp"; . /home/control/daily.control; /home/master/ufcudla_process.sh 1 0 2>> /d/daily/ufcu/today.log

15 07 * * 1-7 . export dp_printer="tx_dp"; . /home/control/daily.control; /home/master/ufcuml1_process.sh 1 0 n,s,e 2>> /d/ufcu/ufcuml1_today.log

------------------Per Tun--------------------------

Client dropped multiple files in bu/ folder. So Rogelio needs manually put one file by one file to reprocess .

Can you modify script to process each file inside the bu/ folder, recursively?

In case if you don't know we normally call main $* at the end after main function end (reference: wtcu_dl_process.sh).

-------------------per DSI-----------------------------

For lccu daily (lccudna_process.sh) we handled multiple data file for a single day. In this case after completing each data file process, we create a folder based on cycle(date) and segment of data file and move all processed files to that folder. To avoid too much folder being created we just deleted previous folder with current segment. Please advise you are good with it or not. We have already discussed with Tun on zoom channel , he is okay it and asked to check with DP if is there any difficulties.

comment: [~Bryanl]: There was no timeline documented in the TeamSupport ticket from our team so I did not reserve any resources from Tanmay. For now, I will tentatively put a live date of 1/31/2022 (but it may extend further out if he is too tied up with existing commitments for this in-house update).



[~tanmay]: I will mark live date to be 1/31/2022. If more time is needed, then please let us know so that we can see when Feb/Mar date would be.



[~anwarh]/[~rony]: FYI. I'm going to add this to smart sheet since this project was not planned.

This is currently going through parallel now, I accidentally mixed up the ticket with the Mortgage parallel ticket, thank you!

comment: [~Bryanl]I guess parallel has been completed. I am preparing for code release.
