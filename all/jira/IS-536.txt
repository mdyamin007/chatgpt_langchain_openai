Please see attached document with changes client requested.


 * The return address should be updated to 60 N. Frontage Rd
 * On the right hand side under the 800 number, they would like the B in the website to be capitalized
 * Under the box in the Interest Rate section, they would like S/B removed and there should be a period (.) after the %. Also the index name should be in that next sentence and is pulled from record 3 column 129-160.[^20211103133843.pdf][^Rate and Payment Change mapping 20211022.docx]

Please see request from client below. Please provide new samples.



just one minor change. All rates should have 3 digits after the decimal point. ( I.e. 3.25% should be 3.250%). it appears that most do with the exception of margin.

comment: [~rony] [~tohidulI] There's a discrepancy in the enotice output between the latest index file for parallel and the previous index file that QA tested with. I uploaded the resources to all servers, so that does not seem to be the issue. Can you take a look? Attaching screenshots of the difference, there's no text inside the black header bar in the most recent file:
