description: Permanent change to update IS/ISD programs to include Account Type for paperless file processing for DDA/Monthly Statements. Here is the full list tied to BKPL's Control File/data:



*D* = Checking

*S* = Savings

*L* = Loan

*T* = Certificate of Deposit & any other letter type except Safe Deposit Box

*B* = Safe Deposit Box

*P* = Promontory Statements

*W* = Wealth Management ( We understand that Wealth Mgt will not be included in the control file but we still need to assign an App Code for internal process).
