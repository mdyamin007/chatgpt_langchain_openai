description: Define ACN before calling the message manager module.



Would you please review this. in MVCUMS31.dfa I believe the issue is the variable ACN is declared in SET_INDEX_VARIABLES

which gets called after MSG_MGR_FORMAT_CU_MSG.

So it comes to print the message with selective criteria ACN was not defined.
