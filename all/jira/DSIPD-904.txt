title: Missing Information List for Current Demo Phase 2
description: We still have some information missing in order to proceed development of the current demo site. I have listed all the points below from earlier emails:
 * Need to know more specifically about NCR. Web portal updates
 * Need more specific idea about the graphics and messages in it for marketing pieces from onshore

 * Need more specific ideas about the graphics and messages in it For the new top banner ad

 * Need samples of our better looking documents. Many documents in the demo are dated and not visually appealing.

Apart from these requestedchanges, James also requested a complete UI change for the Single Sign-On Site for which I think we need to know more. Please let me know when we can haveall this information so we can proceed further.

Please replace anywhere on the demo site where attachment "Current Demo Image" is located with attachment "Demo Site_Check Your Credit Score. I have attached the indesign file in case you need to adjust the image size. I have also attached two of our better-looking statements, please replace older statements located on the demo site.I will also send these updates in an email so that I can cc James and Justin.

comment: All we still need the following information to proceed:

-> specific pdf for checking, Checking Images, Home Equity, VISA Classic, Mortgage is needed. The pdf provided (Bar Graph Statement, Statement with Pie Graph) seems to be a genuine loan statement.

->In the NCR screenshots provided, the login page has not been added. Do we keep the current login page or should be make a new one consistent with the new design. For the latter we might need a screenshot.

->for the rotating banner, do we need specific banners for each tab that will rotating when a tab is selected? for eg: selecting mortgage will show 3/4 mortgage banners that will rotate.

Here you go, it looks like they also changed the sales site from "First Digital" to "Spring Bank"
