title: Menlo Port 8980 Open Request
description: [~kent.chan] and [~premraj.patil]: Because of the host IP update code changes on our programming, we need to open up port 8980 to 10.8.9.162. There was an email chain last Friday on this and I missed it.



Here are the source IP addresses that needs to connect to 10.8.9.168:8980:



rhs(10.8.9.61)

rh2(10.8.9.62)

rhs2(10.8.9.70)

preprocessing02 (10.8.9.60)

preprocessing03(10.8.9.63)



Can you guys please open up the port?

comment: [~kent.chan]: We are going to change the approach. Anil is going to change the existing webapp-prod22 application to use port 8980 instead of 8080. I will close this ticket out.



Thanks!
