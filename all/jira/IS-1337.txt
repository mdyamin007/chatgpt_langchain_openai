Asked Alex to run in rhs in the smartsheet. Code update is in parallel. I couldn't ask here cause his/her name doesn't appear when using @.

This also needs 2 external files. Script will prompt for those files and we couldn't find it to run.

Thanks

comment: [~rony]: Thanks for the update! I will update the status on the smartsheet to ask Alex to retest. If all is successful, I will update you on this ticket to submit to QA so that we can release code to production.

comment: [~rony]: Please move forward with QA on this project. I reviewed idcu99c results that Alex performed and it's good.

I need help here. There are 4 forms involved here. Smartsheet row 43,44,45,46 form98 99a 99c 99i. I changed to all for pdfi to afp2web update. But I couldn't find the data file for 99a. Would it be possible to get help here to provide me the data file for 99a so that I can provide to qa for that form too.



Thanks


author: william.kong
comment: [~rony]: Let's go ahead and proceed with QA w/o 99a form. I would expect the results will be the same since all these forms are sharing the same formatting program.

IDCU98.zip IDCU9A.zip IDCU9C.zip IDCU9I.zip are in qa folder.

/d/ac-secure-share/qa/IgorK/is-1337/1098 has archival sample for 1098 form. There are 4 dfas I found in server 98 9A 9C 9I . But I providing archival sample for only 1098.

So this a 64 bit conversion task. When dp tries to runidcutax_process.sh in rhs it was giving error. Reason for this inside each dfa of idcutax pdfi was implemented which can only run in rh2. So I needed to change this to pdfi to afp2pdf call. After that Alex already ran in rhs and it ran ok.



Per smartsheet row 43 his afpcompare result was good and verified by [~William.Kong] .

I am also providing dpvs just in case you want to look into the print sample.[^idcu098431.print]print 1-5 page from 4.2o2.



I will provide archival for the rest of the forms asap.



Thanks

We received archival samples for 1098 and 1099C forms

Will you provide archival samples for 1099A and 1099INT forms?


author: rony
comment: Hi [~berezinez]

/d/ac-secure-share/qa/IgorK/is-1337/1099i/IDCU_TaxForms_2021_4.7z is archival sample for 1099i.



I don't have the data file for 1099a. I asked Dp once to provide me but they couldn't. I am asking again in the smartsheet.

Thanks


author: rony
comment: Hi [~William.Kong]

There is no data file for 1099a, Format program is actually different for all forms and we are missing this data for this 99a form. The coding change is done. But would it be possible to manage the data file? I asked Dp but they couldn't find either.

QA is completed, I've verified 1098, 1099c, 1099i, for 1099a form data is not provided.

please attach IS checklist.

What should be the next step? Do we need to do a parallel test, or go to release?



Thanks


author: rony
comment: Hi [~William.Kong] 

Any feedback? Should I go for release?



Thanks


author: william.kong
comment: [~rony]: Yes, please proceed with the release as long as we pass QA. For project 64b, we will not need to go through parallel run since DP already tested in parallel environment.
