I've enabled the createAccount feature through SSO reqeust, and this should resolve the previous issue where account number with type "32" can't login because Infoimage doens't have the acctount number/type combination. Client could start testing with Infoimage's pilot site.



Please confirm with the client that both SSO methods "digitallnsight" and "BB" should have this feature enable.

Please call me so that I could show you what the change is, it's on infoconfig and allowing SSO request to create new accounts.
