comment: Hi [~mac]will samples be up on pilot tomorrow?



can you also provide screenshots as I don't think the client has access to pilot.

I can have the samples up on pilot tomorrow. What sample would be sufficient? The only thing I can think of is the sample email that the user receives which will display their name, will that be sufficient?


author: mattl
comment: [~mac], I think so.

This should be for all, if they want they can provide some account numbers, and I can generate a sample email like the one above on pilot.

comment: I think we're good. Please advise when you are able to release or if any further testing is needed?

Hi Matt,

I can have this released on 4/5 which is the proposed live date. In the mean time, the client can also send an Auth file, and I can see if that inputs user's names correctly into our system.

Client uploaded both of today's auth files (full file and new member file) to the test folder.
