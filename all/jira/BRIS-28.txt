Sync CVS Code

$CVSROOT = bb-rcs.infoimageinc.com:/extra/is_cvs


author: william.kong
comment: cvs is installed.

code has been synced once.



Note: On the original RCS menlo server (10.8.9.40), I've placed the /root/sync_menlo_rcs.sh in there.



Anytime I need to manually sync it, I can log in and invoke this command
