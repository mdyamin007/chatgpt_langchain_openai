----------------------per Yamee--------------------------------

Joye, as we are changing the anchors we need to do parallel. I am not sure if we can go LIVE before EOM. I am providing new timeline and will see if we can get everything done before that.



Also FYI, the program actually only reads the address block from first page and print the same to all pages. So the "HOLD" addresses will still display the same as the first page. Please inform client.
