title: SSCU - [21952][pvt] Setup System Upgrade Letter for eNotice only 
description: Summary: Posted most of the notices successfully except for 1 bad zip file. However due to the level 3 TS31255, some new accounts were created by the index file client provided us. As a result we deleted those and left the rest as is, client confirmed we should halt this project.

* SSCU - Conversion eNotice for Core Conversion April 2022 RUSH - ( child of 21952)
Live date 8/5
* App: DL
* Description: SSCU will be converting to a new core and as a result they will need to send a conversion notice to their members.
 * This will be for an one-time eNotice only. (They will print and mail the print notice on their end)
 * There are around 275,000 eNotices (2page color eNotice)
 * There will be no special messaging or email that goes out. They say default email notification that normally goes out is suffice.
 * The letter code 99 for this one time eNotice, so that we do not accidentally re-use this letter code for future projects.

Can you please assign an programmer for this?

Thanks, Barnett

comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] Please take care of this project. They haven't sent a sample following our spec yet, but I went over it with the CU already. If they followed our spec, the only thing we need to do is to extract the index and zip file, and placed it in the right folder in input server for posting.


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~barnetts] I can assist with this. Let me know when they send us the files for posting so that I can validate.

comment: [~barnetts] Live date of 3/31 has passed, can we have a new live date? Also based on the ticket, it sounds like we want to add the letter code/description 099 - System Upgrade Letter to the site, can you confirm? Thanks

The error seems to do with the compression method, however I'm not sure why that is. I'll discuss with my team tomorrow morning and see if there's anything else I can try. I'll provide another update afterwards.

Edit: we tested all the zip folders and updated the successful/failed list, only 13 zip file folders were successful. The failed list contains all the zip folders that encountered issues. Can we please have the client rezip those failed files and send them over again?
*NOTE*: I noticed that the largest successful zip file seems to be around 1.71 Gb while the failed ones were around 2 Gb or more, so the failure could be due to the size.

comment: Hi [~Shun.Kuwashima],

Please see SSCU  comment below:

Regarding your recent ticket update, you mentioned many of the compressed files we uploaded are giving you issues? I am able to open these on our side. I used native Windows .zip process to create them. Im able to double-click these and open them without issue. Not sure what I can do to fix them, other then use a different program like 7zip to re-create them.

Thanks, Barnett 


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~barnetts] can they try reducing the size of those zip file folders mentioned? Like I mentioned previously, it seems like the issue may be due to size when comparing the successful vs failed zip folders. If they aren't able to reduce the size further, then we may need them to split up the remaining pdf files into smaller zip folders and then provide an updated index file accordingly. 

Also, the accounts tied to a successful zip folder are posted but I didn't trigger emails for them yet. Is it ok to send those emails out first, or should we wait until we can post all of the statements successfully?

comment: Thanks [~Shun.Kuwashima],

I will follow up with SSCU.

Thanks, Barnett

Per SSCU,
Speaking only to the email notifications, please hold off on sending any out until we give the ok. 

They are still looking into the zip files

Thanks ,Barnett

Client stated they uploaded new files.  Please see below.

Thank you for the patience waiting on me.  The new sets of the files are uploading to our TEST folder now.  During this upload, you should receive 59 files total (58 ZIP's and 1 index).

There is 1 compressed file I am still working on due to an issue I had (S25001-S30000.zip).  I'm hoping it will be fixed and uploaded before the end of the afternoon.  It is not included in these 59 other files I am uploading now.  I will update the ticket when that single file is finished. 

Please let me know if you have any issues with these items.

Thank you very much for all of the help!!!

comment: [~jharvey] I just came back from vacation today so I didn't see this till now. Can the client confirm if all the files have the same name as before? At a glance I do see some of the files but just a note that the file size still looks to be around 2.5Gb per file so we may run into issues again like last time (previously files above 2Gb seemed to cause posting issues so we requested they try to reduce each file size or split them into more smaller files). I will need to test early next week to confirm.

comment: Hi [~jharvey]/ [~Shun.Kuwashima],

Please see SSCU response below. I will follow up with them to send smaller files.

Per SSCU, 
Sorry for my delayed response, I did not see your earlier question.
Attached is the file list and file sizes I see on our side. In total you should have 59 compressed files and 1 index file. I thought the original issue was the ZIP files were corrupted and could not be opened at all, not an issue with the compressed sizes being over 2.5GB. If you are unable to use them, I will try again with a higher compression set. If we have to break them into smaller batches, I will need more help on this side to finish that.Sorry for the confusion, and thank you for the help.

Thanks, Barnett

Just a reminder, below are the zip folders which the index file was able to successfully retrieve documents from, seemingly because they were smaller than the rest:

R2CEG1PDFFILES.zip
R2CPG2PDFFILES.zip
R2CEG3PDFFILES.zip
R2CPG4PDFFILES.zip
R2BPG6PDFFILES.zip
R2BEG7PDFFILES.zip
R2BPG8PDFFILES.zip
R2CBEG9PDFFILES.zip
R2CBPG10PDFFILES.zip
R2CBEG11PDFFILES.zip
R2CBPG12PDFFILES.zip

comment: Hi [~barnetts],

Out of curiosity I checked the enotice archival period and it is currently 4 months, however the SSCU enotice SOW shows 3 months (90 days). Not sure if we need to check with Phoebe on this, but can you help confirm?

Reason I ask is because the index files were originally sent to us with closing dates of 3/31/2022. This means once we reach 8/1, the enotices we post would no longer be viewable anyway due to the current 4 month archival period (and hypothetically if it were supposed to be 3 months, then the enotices would have no longer been viewable since 7/1). Therefore I'm not sure if this is still worth the effort given that we are close to 8/1. Can you check with them on whether we should continue with this project? Thanks!

comment: Hi [~barnetts], thanks I see the new zip files. However because of the need for smaller files, it looks like the zip filenames have been updated, which means we also need an updated index file that contains the updated zip filenames for each account. Can they please provide that to us?

comment: [~barnetts] At a glance it looks good, I will need to confirm since it looks like we finally have all the updated files. If I have time, I'll try to get it running by eod today but may need more time. I'll provide an update later today.


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: Hi [~barnetts], I moved over all the zip files to the correct place and running the index file now. Assuming it finishes successfully, should we still trigger emails? Not sure if it's needed since these notices are dated 4 months ago, but just wanted to confirm.


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: Hi [~barnetts], there were several issues with the index file that the client provided, however I was able to fix all of them and successfully post almost all of the enotices. 

There is only 1 zip file left which is causing issues, *S70001-S72500.zip*, that contains 2500 enotices. Our process cannot unzip this folder, I also tried unzipping it locally and I receive an error when doing so. Please have the client send a new zip folder with the same name and contents.




author: barnetts
comment: Hi [~Shun.Kuwashima],

I will check with SSSU to see if they want email notifications to go out.
I am also request a replacement for the one bad zip file. 


Thanks, Barnett


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~barnetts] On second thought, since the notices are dated 3/31/2022 and their archival period is 4 months as I mentioned before, the notices are no longer viewable anyway so I'm not sure if emails are necessary. Just a reminder on that.


author: barnetts
comment: That is a a good point [~Shun.Kuwashima]


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: Per Phoebe on 21952, emails should not go out. I already disabled them upon posting the notices on 7/29 to be safe (since if needed, I could always add them back in), therefore no emails should send out.


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: Hi [~barnetts], is there any update from the client about a replacement for the one bad zip folder? I know we had to deal with the level 3s in the past couple weeks, so not sure if they made any progress on this.


author: barnetts
comment: HI [~Shun.Kuwashima],

No Update from SSCU. I will follow up with them.

Thanks, Barnett  


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: Hi [~barnetts], forgot to mention earlier, but due to the recent level 3 issues we ended up removing some of the enotices for new accounts that were created through the index file they gave us. Can you ask the client if they want us to keep the removals as is or if we should repost? I attached the list of accts to this story (sscu_0730_purge.csv) that contains all the account notices I removed.


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: Hi [~barnetts] on TS21952 comment 176, it sounds like the client wants to stop posting and close out this request. For the notices that posted successfully, I assume we can just leave them as is since users can no longer see them anyway? If so, then I think we're good to close.
