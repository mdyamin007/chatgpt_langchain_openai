comment: [~billr]: Any status update on this? Eric's plate is quite full. So after client provide approvals, we may not be able to release immediately. Please keep that in mind.

comment: Thanks[~billr]! I forgot that code is already released to production. WE are just needing formal approval on the production samples so that [~eric.yan]can close this ticket out.
