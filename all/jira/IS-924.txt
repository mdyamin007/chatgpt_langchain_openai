comment: Rony/Anwar - Please provide samples for the letter 001 - Escheatment letter since that is the letter we had on hold on our end and you already have the mapping.
We are still pending test data/templates on rest of notices.

comment: Letter samples 001, 007 and 037 are approved, please move to QA.  Rest of notices in this ticket are removed for set up later once CU is ready.

QA, please reference the last attached samples from Najoa as the approved samples.

comment: Najoa, have you moved the code to QA? Please provide the dpvs, print file and image range for QA print samples.

Letter 007 has to mail by 3/30 so we need to follow this timeline:
3/22 - 3/23 - QA
3/24 - 3/25 - Parallel RUSH
3/25 - 3/28 - Code Release
3/28 - 3/30 - Print and Mail
