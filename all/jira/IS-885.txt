description: IS Assessment:

Update existingUFCUML11.dfaprogramming to handle adding two new templates: "Commericial Loan" and "Commerical LOC". -Please refer to attachments in comment #19 in TS #25912.-

Answers for comment #20

From comment #10 and #25:

You should use the Major and Minor tags in the XML within LN_BLXTR

<Major>CML</Major><Minor>BM02</Minor>

If the Major = CNS (consumer) then you should continue using the existing mortgage template.

If the Major = CML (commercial) then you need to look at the minor to determine which template to use. Below is a list of commercial minor codes with the associated template.

BC01 -LOC
 BC02 -LOC
 BC03 -LOC
 BL01 - LOC
 BL02 - LOC
 BL03 - LOC
 BL04 - LOC
 BL05 - LOC
 BL06  LOC
 BL07 - LOC
 BL08 - LOC
 BM01 - MORTGAGE
 BM02 - MORTGAGE
 BM03  MORTGAGE
 BT01  TERM LOAN
 BT02  TERM LOAN
 BT03  TERM LOAN
 BT04 - TERM LOAN
 BT05 - TERM LOAN
 BT06 - TERM LOAN
 BT07 - TERM LOAN

*Major = CML*

Minor = BC01, BC02, BC03, BL01, BL02, BL03, BL04, BL05, BL06, BL07, or BL08 - use the new commercial line of credit template
 ------------------------------------
 Minor = BM01, BM02, or BM03  use the existing mortgage template
 "Commercial" should only have been added to the minor types listed below, and not all mortgage minors:
 BM01
 BM02
 BM03
 ------------------------------------
 Minor = BT01, BT02, BT03, BT04, BT05, BT06, or BT07  use the new commercial loan template

comment: Hi [~Bryanl]

just to be sure, if the major code is "MTG" we are using the current mortgage template.


author: bryanl
comment: [~tohidulI]

Per client if major = MTG, then use the existing mortgage template. Thanks!

2. Sample file ufcuml1127 (ufcuml117_FEEDBACK.pdf) : update payment descriptions as indicated in attachment



Thank you!


author: tohiduli
comment: Hi [~Bryanl]

Are the feedback no 2 applicable for all the templates? "Commericial Loan" and "Commerical LOC" and default "mortgage" templates?

and to clarify if the following logic is correct according to feedback

<Accounts><Account><LoanRtxnDetails><RtxnDetails><TranDesc> value =="Regular Payment - Note Balance" then change it to "Regular Payment - Principal Balance"

<Accounts><Account><LoanRtxnDetails><RtxnDetails><TranDesc> value =="Regular Payment - Note Interest" then change it to "Regular Payment - Interest"



If this application for all the 3 templates can you update the mapping of those templates?

Per client:

The final edit request would be updating "Mortgage Statement" to "Commercial Mortgage Statement" so it is consistent with the others.

Could your team update the template with that change? Everything else looks great!

Thanks!

comment: [~tohidulI]

Client's response:

The edit looks good (adding commercial to the top), but do we know what data was used for the first statement example or is this data to be ignored for this one? The Past Payments Breakdown is significantly off from the loan balance or any figures that would be associated with this loan as the balance and there are some odd letters in the late charge assessment descriptions. Just was wondering if this first one was a one-off that can be ignored or if its a larger issue. This loan paid off on 12/1/2021 so that could be why but just wanted to ask.



Thank you!

The data was changed by me to test if the table can hold a large value.

comment: [~rony] [~Bryanl] [~Kbittmann]

Client responded to sample:

We had one additional note from our Commercial Loan team, that maybe you could take another look at to confirm:

Every other statement (outside of the LOCs) in this file shows Commercial Mortgage Statement but they are all retail, consumer mortgages so they shouldn't have Commercial at the top.

So just to clarify, "Commercial" should only have been added to the minor types listed below, and not all mortgage minors:

*BM01*

*BM02*

*BM03*


author: tohiduli

comment: Hi [~Andrey.Kutsenko] [~tohidulI]

Per client:

The United team needs to investigate why minor codes are missing. There shouldnt be any commercial loans that are not attached to a minor. That being said, we don't want to launch this until the data issue has been resolved, so let's hold for now.

In the meantime, would you be able to tell us how often your team is seeing this occur, and provide additional examples to understand if this is a specific issue we can identify?



Thank you!


author: JIRAUSER11104
comment: Hi [~tohidulI] [~Bryanl]

I think, here it is necessary to refine the logic for processing such data in the format step. That is, in the case of a code, we have (Major = CML and Minor is empty), then skip the formation of such Statements and write to the error log.

Thanks.


author: bryanl
comment: [~Andrey.Kutsenko] [~tohidulI]

Per client:

We think this might be a one-off situation, but do you know how many times the minor code has been missing from the data? Could you provide other examples if you have them?

Thanks!


author: tohiduli
comment: [~Bryanl]

I checked the all the data file in the backup directory. No data file has an empty minor code.
