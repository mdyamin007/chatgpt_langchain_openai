title: BKPL [26661] [pvt] CSV Phase 2 Update - Letter 006
description: BKPL CSV Phase 2 Update - Letter 006

BKPL just went LIVE with their CSV Phase 2 rollout (see IS-624). Letter #6 was setup incorrectly due to lack of info from the bank.

Please see attached test file and templates. The data file contains a code in column 4 (LetterCode). We need to match that number to the corresponding template.

The file name is misspelled and isn't following the naming convention:
BKPL_ILS-Outsourced-Mail_MMDDYY.zip.gpg

Please have the client resend the file with the correct name.

If not, we can change the file name just this time for testing and processing purposes.

comment: [~Natalie.Tom]- Please update internally. I actually did so but looks like I made a typo. Thanks.

comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]: I spoke with [~Natalie.Tom]and she will manually rename file to create new samples for testing. However, please ensure client fixes the filenaming convention so that program does NOT break when we go live.

comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] - please request print samples


author: william.kong
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]: Please confirm if client has fixed the file naming convention. I understood that we (InfoIMAGE) fixed the file naming convention, but I want ensure at the time of going live the customer will send the file naming convention correctly. Failure to fix file naming convention will delay production SLA. Please ensure to set this expectation w/ Client.
