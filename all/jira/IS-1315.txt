Just to confirm for checking and certificate account the interest rate summary section should not be removed, right? Sorry I didn't ask this while assessing.



Thanks

comment: Hi [~Tasneem], Please provide PDFs of just savings account. QA has no way to differentiate account types. Also please provide a smaller sample size that I can send to the client via the ticketing system.

Attached below is a smaller pdf.

We have removed theInterest Rate Summary section only from the savings accounts and not from any other type of accounts. Please check the 2nd account of the pdf which is a certificate account, having theInterest Rate Summary section while the savings account do not have that section.
