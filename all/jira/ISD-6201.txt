*Previously Implementation:*
 # After clicking search, active tab used be switched from current tab to default tab(eStatement tab).
 # If search range doesnt include any statements of current tab, clicking search button would disappear the current tab.
 # If search range doesnt include any statements of all tabs, clicking search button would disappear all tabs including checks tab.
 # Date format was in M/dd/yyyy format in search range under eStatement page, Check tab and batchDownload page.

 # If search range doesnt include any statements of current tab, active tab remain on the same statement tab and it shows this message: This account does not have any documents of this type to view at this time. Or if noResultFoundText is defined that will be shown.
 # If search range doesnt include any statements of all tabs, active tab remain on the same statement tab and it shows this message: This account does not have any documents of this type to view at this time and check wont disappear if they have check image feature.
