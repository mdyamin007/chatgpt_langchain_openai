comment: No issues. QA passed.


author: dyuen
comment: [~tanmay]I just checked the samples and the verbiage does not appear to be updated...

Per Jira description:

search with Fees for Mission Courtesy Pay. It appears 2 times in dfa. Need to replace this with:

"Fees for Overdraft Protection and Debit Card Overdraft Protection".

Please advise.

Thanks

comment: [~tanmay], spoke with [~Igor.Khosid]and it appears that the incorrect file was submitted for client approval, but the correct PDF sample was reviewed and passed by QA.

page 269 frommfcums11014.2o1 in my secure share folder displays the correct verbiage.

Please confirm that this will be released on 10/26 as stated in the timeline in the Jira description.

Thanks


author: tanmay
comment: yes incorrect was on client sample. I wonder how they approved that.

But correct one is in parallel that [~Igor.Khosid] has tested.

yes we can release tomorrow
