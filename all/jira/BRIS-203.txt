comment: [~rony]: After your VPN is restored, can you confirm that you can ssh to the brisbane dsi server: 10.5.20.38. Please re-assign ticket back to me with your results.

Thanks!

[~rony]: Please update the ticket in the future so that we can get this over to Network team faster. I'm going to re-assign this ticket to Kent.

comment: I'm not seeing any traffic coming across to BB from DSi. Naim's team is also having issues. Is the VPN to BB up?

comment: [~rony]: Can you work with Naim? I didn't realize Naim is also facing vpn connection issue. Once he confirms access can you retest and re-assign ticket back to me with your result.



thanks!
