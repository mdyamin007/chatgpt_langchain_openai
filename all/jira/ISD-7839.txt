comment: [~andreav] The 26 etax forms are posted onto pilot. Please have the client verify each one under  Account Management on InfoTRAC pilot. Tax forms should be visible under the Tax Statements tab. Each tax form posted should show 2022-03-18 as provided.

comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid], this project consists of manually posting 26 tax statements. There should be a 1099INT, 1099R and 5498 etax job on stage totaling 26 altogether. Below is a screenshot of the jobs:

The tax statements seems to have masked account numbers with only the last 4 digits showing. Please have someone verify on Stage InfoTRAC Account Management that the last 4 digits match the account number on the profile and the name matches as well.

[~andreav] I've posted these taxes to production and disabled emails. If they do want emails to send out, just lmk and I can add those email jobs back in, otherwise this is completed.
