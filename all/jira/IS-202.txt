The sample is currently ready for customer approval  I will attach it now. I still need to verify some things before handing the program files over to QA.

While I have provided the customer sample already, could you also confirm whether the addressee name should follow 'Customer' in 'Dear Customer:' (e.g. Dear Customer: Sam) or should it stay as 'Dear Customer' (as shown in the PDF sample)

Please see below client feedback:



Can you ask these follow up questions for me, thanks.

1. are they asking if the masking is good?

2. I am asking Jess how our other notices are if we want Dear Customer or the clients name

3. I am also asking if there is a main address or if they should just mail to the branch.

4. not sure what they are asking here, we do want the notice number and Banner Address there.

Kris,

For some reason, I didn't receive your last comments even though I'm on the watcher list. Please, next time, start the comments with "@ and select the person name you want the comments need to be delivered.

Sam
 I am also wondering if the parallel test is required?

If the parallel not needed I can push for QA passed

Here are the IS programmer details to process this job in parallel:

Processing procedure: /home/test/procs/banbdla.procs
 Input file location and name: /z/ftpbu/banbbu/test/BANB_DN_20210712130800.zip.pgp
 Cycle #17
 Special instructions: /home/test/master/banb_dl_process.sh 1 bypass

Let's try to get through parallel by end of day.


author: JIRAUSER10906
comment: Code has been released. Will need to fix processing script at a later date to ensure appropriate files are placed in the client pickup folder during a parallel run.
