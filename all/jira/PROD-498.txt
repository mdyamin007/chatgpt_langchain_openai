title: Infotrac User role name change issue
description: We can edit role name on infotrac user roles level. When we create a new role, database saves name and code columns with new name. If we edit role name on UI, database updates only name column in db and we are not able to create new role with old role name. Change is to update code column on database whenever role name is changed.
