description: Things to check:
 * Auth file.
 ** Go to the Production PUI site and search for their latest Auth file Process to find out the name of the latest auth file. It should be named something like WECU_CIF...
 ** Open up the Production PUI linux server and go to this path to find their latest auth file:/d/INPUT/I3/process-files-backup/wecu/202104
 ** Look into the file itself and search for those specific account numbers as shown in the screenshot on the team support ticket in comment 1.
 * Database, most likely will need the following tables:
 ** fin_account
 ** usr_fin_account (join to fin_account by acct_id)
 ** ***notification_preference (join to usr_fin_account by usr_id)
 ** usr_mapping (join to usr_fin_account by usr_id)

comment: Select * from fin_account fa
join usr_fin_account ufa on ufa.ACCT_ID = fa.ACCT_ID
Join notification_preference np on np.USR_ID = ufa.USR_ID
Where fa.org_id = getorgid('wecu');
