comment: Hi[~Igor.Khosid], per our conversation, ISD-7916 a little bit separate from this jira. IS needed to update the code, whereas the ISD Jira is just transferring notices to the correct account type so it shouldn't need QA.

Thanks

comment: Thanks [~Igor.Khosid]

[~yameelee], please confirm next steps. Do you need to release code before [~Shun.Kuwashima]can transfer the letters?

Thanks


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~yameelee] [~Igor.Khosid] Sorry please disregard, there are no acct type 99 for notice codes 023 and 024.

[~dyuen] Yes we would need to perform the transfer after the IS update is completed on production so that we can just transfer all the notices in one shot.

Code has been released.
