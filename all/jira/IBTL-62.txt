comment: [~tient]: Thanks for reporting.. I will look into it and update you later.  preprocessing02 is a fresh install so might be missing a library. Once the processing is done, please run AFPCompare. I want to make sure the XML data input is not impacted and causes the Papyrus AFP output to be different.



I'll keep you posted.

Thanks!

comment: [~tient]: Can you retry again?



I updated the libxml to a more recent version from current version 2.3.6 but 3.4.2 on both ca-preproc-pr-02 & ca-preproc-pr-03:

pip install lxml==3.4.2



I also compared the output between Menlo & Brisbane and the check sum matches in parallel:

a7b3381dd48dad3bd4a2ab3b8ea3c6f8 /z/file_share/amac_loanstmts_ACBS_08032020.xml.fix



Please run AFPCompare to double-check as well. 



Thanks!



 Will
