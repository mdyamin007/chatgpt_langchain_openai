comment: [~tohidulI] [~rony] I apologize that requesting this additional test file to be loaded to the pilot site, it includes the additional account numbers SLCU needs to finalize for testing:

SLCUVISA.0801.zip

Is it possible to generate for ISD to post as well? Sorry for sending so late.

Thank you!

My understanding is that we need to update the index file to a new index format.
Would it be possible to provide details for the wanted updates? 
SOW / descriptions
I just compared the production file with a new one and did not see any updates.

[~avannik] - FYI

comment: Hmm [~Igor.Khosid]

Are you saying you don't see any differences with the coding resources? For example, difference I can see:

[ronyD@dsi ac-secure-share Mon Sep 19 23:09]$ diff /d/is/cvs/check_out/ronyD/slcues1.control /home/test/control/slcues1.control
46a47,51
> new_e_index=1
> estmt_trac="y"
> afp_split_count=20000
> new_move_afp=1
> e_automate="s"



Let me know.



Thanks

I was told that this is the index file update. I clearly can see updates in the control files.

[~phoebe.george] [~kericapote]
Would it be possible to have information for the updates?


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~Igor.Khosid] Alex reached out on this project, and so we scheduled an internal meeting for today to go through the updates. Let us know if you want us to forward you the meeting invite to join. We'll walk through the updates with him and confirm what add'l updates need to be made to the SOW. You are correct that it is the index file update, but not sure how that would impact the control files from the IS side. Will need [~rony] to assist to answer this. Thanks!

comment: [~phoebe.george] - yes, please invite me to the meeting

comment: [~rony]please provide the new index file like in [IS-921|https://jira.infoimageinc.com/browse/IS-921].

comment: Hi [~avannik]

For only ms1 we provided an index file with wrong naming(extra underscore mentioned in bt-364) and old structure, the rest of the index files were in the correct structure.

Let me know if you are facing issues with other index files.



Thanks

comment: mv1_20220731_1_20220919_0642_slcu.txt ran successfully on Staging PUI.

Job results look good in InfoTRAC.

However, they don't show in Job Status there because the eStmt job is not tracked ([^exec log for job 197041.html]).

Please check as I'm not sure if that is expected or not.
