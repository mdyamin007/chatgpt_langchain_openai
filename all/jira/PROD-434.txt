Hi Jun,

Can you help purge all BFCU and MTCU data from Oracle db on all environments? Per Jessica, they were both discontinued as of 7/13/20.

Thanks,
 Shun

comment: [~jwhang] is this task or are you keeping it open for on going purging?  If so, I think we should remove MTCU and BFCU from the title to avoid confusion.
Thanks
David
