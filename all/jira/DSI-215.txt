title: INHS - hypercube - meteor version changing from 1.1 to 1.9
description: Hi [~rifat.mahmud],

We have been noticing that the symbolic link in hypercube, */home/meteor/.meteor/meteor* symbolic link on pd-pilot1 changes.

Can you see why the symbolic link for meteor is changing to 1.9?

I have attached the email regarding the contents.
