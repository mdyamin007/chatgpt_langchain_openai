title: LCCU Add RMD Notice do Daily Notices
description: None


author: william.kong
comment: Samples were provided in smartsheet for Ratna to review. It is an "initial" sample; not final sample.


author: william.kong
comment: [~ratnam] and [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] : Per Najoa, there is on tag missing. This project is scheduled for 7/23. DSi will off next week. We need to know if this 7/23 is must go live date.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: This is NOT a must go LIVE date. CU is unresponsive. Will follow up.


author: william.kong
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]: Thanks for the update! One project that I don't have to worry about next week while DSi is OOO. Can we get a new revised live date after DSi returns and granted that we have complete data file to continue coding.



Thanks!



-- Will


author: william.kong
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]: I understand that you are current OOO this week. But we have waited for long time for feedback. Can you follow-up with client to get an ETA on when they can plan on providing feedback.



[~ratnam]: FYI.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: Hi DSI,

The CU believes the data they provided has issues. The person who can create the new data is out until next week. At that time they can send us new data.


Please include the following changes in the annual notice 3rd paragraph.

If you have elected to postpone the first years distribution until Postpone_date, you are required to take two IRA distributions by RMD_date.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~ratnam]-2 RMD xml files were just sent over to be used for new samples. Please confirm.


author: JIRAUSER10907
comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com], [~ratnam]any feedback from client?


author: william.kong
comment: [~tanmay]: Per our comment last week. This job is put ON HOLD indefinitely.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~Najoa]- The CU would like to suppress certain notices from being sent. Since the letters don't have an account number, can we suppress by name? I can tell the CU that they can send us a suppression list with the names but they have to match what is in the XML.



Can this be done? Does it need to be programmed?


author: JIRAUSER10907
comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com], yes it needs to be programmed. We can suppress using the name, according to datafile it should have first name, middle name and last name but for more safety it will be better if we consider full name along with the address so that correct customer gets suppressed. Let us know in which letters suppression logic will be applicable.

Thanks

Najoa


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: Hi [~Najoa]- It applies to both. Can you tell me how many hours it will take to program? I'll need to see if charges need to be made to the client.



Thanks


author: tanmay
comment: HI [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]it will take 2 hour to program.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~tanmay] [~Najoa]- Quick question - if we need to program to have the ability to suppress via customer name and address, how do you want the suppression file to be sent? I'm thinking...

Format: Plain .txt file

Contents: First Name | Last Name | Address 1 | Address 2 | City | State | Zip



What do you think?


author: rony
comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]

yes seems ok.




author: tanmay
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]any updates?




author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: Hi [~tanmay] [~rony]- the CU elected to not to add the account number to the data file (vendor taking too long). They gave us the attached suppression file to use for testing. Does it match the test data file we have?

author: JIRAUSER10907
comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com], yes it matches with test datafile.

Please confirm we are going to use this ticket or another one for the updates


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~tanmay]- Lets use this ticket.



[~William.Kong]- This update is because LCCU had a last minute request to add an insert. DSI states this will take 1 hour to setup and we will run parallel. LCCU would like to print this as an inline. I will create another PR ticket for this update. This letter is sent annually so we have until 2023 to set this up. I will add an additional hour to the estimate when I bill them for the inline update.
