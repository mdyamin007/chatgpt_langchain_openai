comment: Hi [~rumanb], MFCU is requesting a change to the letter. Please see the following:

I have been given word that there needs to be a change to the letter file. Can we remove the Survey at the end of the letter. Attached is what we are now asking to also be removed from the letter.

Those actually represent back pages. So when it will be printed those empty pages will be the back pages.
