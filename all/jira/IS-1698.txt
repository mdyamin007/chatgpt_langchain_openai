Can you make the formatting changes? Seeclient's feedback below.

************************************************************************************************************

Thank you Dawn. All of the information in the letters look good I just have a few formatting questions/request if possible and not too time constraining. I am sure the sizing of the address is for the envelope, but was just curious if the size of font in general is also standard? The second spacing issue is my fault I did not delete the spaces in-between from the mapping letter, can you guys remove the extra spacing?

The font size is arial 8 that we use as a standard font and for the body part of the letter i have used the same font of the existingBalance Demand Letter (VWCUDL052). !vwcu1.PNG!

The updated sample after removing the spaces is attached below :[^vwcudl053_21stOctober.pdf]

We had a condition that all the account doesn't get suppressed from the paper due to enotice enrollment but we found out that theesup_ignore variable which is used to ignore the paperless file in the control file was not exported so i have to export theesup_ignore in the control file a screenshot is attached below. Moreover, there were also some existing letter that are included in theesup_ignore list in the control file but i don't know how those letters are ignoring the paperless file as the esup_ignore variable was not exported until now.
