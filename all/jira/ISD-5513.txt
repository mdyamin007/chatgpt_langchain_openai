comment: May be i am not using right data, but i still have error page on login.

Do I need to use correct NetTeller and CashMgmt data or any or go to step 2 in a form using uniqueID from DB. I tried all different ways and still no success.

Have you added the following entry in the host file?

10.5.16.191 bbbbstage.infoimageinc.com


author: nprimak
comment: Yes I did, long time ago. The error is not because on host file, I hit the site with error page after last submit

Make sure that there is only one entry for bbbbstage.infoimageinc.com in the host file.


author: nprimak
comment: I commented old entry in a host file when I added new entry.

It is not host file error, it is page error

comment: Re-tested, works well, possible it was cashe issue, but i doubt because i was testing in different browsers.

Did not test console log error on enrollment steps, looks like they don't have it for this client, based on SSO, using already existing in DB UniqueID
