title: FCSB - Should not be able to selecte papereless from profile without checking an email
description: For some reason the client and I have been able to select the peerless option without needing to check an email. This should not happen.

I've been able to replicate the issue on FHNB dev for CIF# 7.

Please help figure out what is causing this issue. Thanks.

So far i  have not able to produce this issue. I am assuming that, this issue occur due to



{code:javascript}if (oForm.estatement<%= i %>.value ==='E'){code}

where you have compare value with type. Generally we compare on value.



Next day i will again research on this.



thanks,

comment: Hi [~Michael.Holden] ,

I am still not able to reproduce the issue. I have one question that, there is any process in PUI which remove data from restriction table for this client.If data is remove from restriction table that time an account can show is selected as paperless without selected email address.

thanks,

comment: I found out that the direct_enrollment may switch a user from B' to E and does not include any logic to remove restrictions. Im hoping this is the only case where this happens. 

The excess record in the database seems to make the validation not work correctly. I think this is the cause.

I need you to make a program that will check their current membership. If the account paperless is E' and they have a restriction for BOTH np_ids, please log the account number and np Ids. We will need to clean the database after I fix this process.

please pick file "DataMigration.zip.pgp" from ftp server. It contains the script.

you need to  change system.prop with  your's one and run com.infoimage.datamigration.DataMigration.java. You will see  log in    logs/Updatelog.log.

Let me what kind of change you need.

thanks,
