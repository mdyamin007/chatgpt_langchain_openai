title: UFCU - [28343][pvt][in-house] Manual Approval Process
description: After experiencing several months of no data issues, we would like to remove the manual approval process from monthly statements. Marketing will still approve the statement message or insert as included in those processes, we will just remove the final "approval" allowing InfoImage to go directly to production and expedite the creation of the archival file.



Disabling advance online proofing to expedite production.
