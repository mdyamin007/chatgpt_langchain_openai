The suppression list is in /home/test/keep/frstdla/FRST_COA_Suppress.csv
I tested with account number "90300008753" in both letters, and it suppresses generating the records.

Check result by `grep 90300008753 /z/daily/frst/*.txt`

When releasing, copy the *original *suppress list to /home/keep/frstdla/ folder.

comment: Eric,

Is there a way we can show the client the records will be suppressed or would it be best to show them a sample DPVS?

Thank-you,

Keri

The suppressed record is not generated at all, so it won't be shown on DPVS.

In order to confirm the record is suppressed, I could do a search for account number in both the data file and the output index, to highlight a specific account is not generated. 
I could also generate a summary list of suppressed account, if that's helpful.

comment: Hi Eric,

Yes, if you could provide both, that would be great.

Thank-you!

comment: This group of screenshot is to illustrate how a specific account is suppressed from being generated for print and archival.
 The target account number is 90300008753 (this is not from the original suppress list, but I added it for testing and illustration purpose).
 !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail!

This account is in letter K
 !screenshot-2.png|width=273,height=60,thumbnail!

The same account number is also in letter L

!image-2021-08-17-14-13-51-910.png|width=268,height=65!



After processing with the updated program, the account number is not being generated in the output index file (index file is used for internal processing purpose and not usually disclosed for external users)

!image-2021-08-17-14-16-08-421.png!

As comparison, other accounts not being suppressed are generated as usual (80007153721 as a test case for normal account)
