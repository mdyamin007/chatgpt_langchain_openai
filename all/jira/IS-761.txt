author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~PramaG]- The bank is complaining that the "9" on page 2 in the Dealer Number at the top right is very close to the "2". The "9" is also very close on page 23. If you look on page 12 they say it looks fine.

Can you add more space?

comment: [~PramaG]- FYI - I updated SOW to show that this app will need to have AOLP setup for ALL cycles.


author: JIRAUSER10909
comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]- any feedback regarding the last sample?


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: Hi [~PramaG]- Yes, these are approved. We just need PDF archival samples. However, the client needs to sign the contract with their vendor so we can discuss details.

Can you please prepare the Dealer Loan for testing (Paper portion only)? I'd like to turnover to QA soon as we have a lot of apps going LIVE next month.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: Hi [~PramaG]- 1 more update. Please see the first sample on the PDF. We're supposed to be suppressing. Please see SOW.

7. Special Handling/Suppressions: Suppress all statements for WESTAMERICA BRANCH  124 and all statements that have a $0.00 balance. Starting Reserve Balance $0.00, Ending Reserve Balance $0.00, Total Number of Loans $0.00
All statements to be returned to the bank flat. No mailing of Paper.


author: JIRAUSER10910
comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com],

author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: Hi [~fahad]- Quick question - the test file you have, is it all 2019 statements? Bank wants to see statements for 2022.


author: JIRAUSER10910
comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com],
Yes, the datafile I have only contains 2019 statements. From the looks of it, I think it is fully dummy data.

[^WEST Dealer Loan Feedback email 9.12.22.pdf]


author: JIRAUSER10909
comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]- According to the client feedback,
 # The space between the header comes from the data file. Certain pages don't have any space between the header, whereas other pages do. If the customer wants to remove this space between the header, please let us know. After that, we'll update it. !image-2022-09-12-15-31-36-944.png!

2. For print image data we keep the pagination as same as the data file. That is the cause of the noticeable gap. Again we can do the pagination manually if the client wants to, thusthose large gaps can be adjusted.

!image-2022-09-12-15-44-41-401.png!

Please let us know. Thanks!


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: Hi [~PramaG],

1. Can you please add a space between the header. The bank likes the way it looks.

2. Yes, please do the pagination manually as the customer is concerned about paper waste.

comment: Hi [~PramaG]- Please see attached. It was taken from the last 4 pages of the westml11314.2o1_updated.pdf.

If you look at the first page, the data goes almost all the way to the bottom. However, on the next few pages, it does not go down all of the way. I thought you were going to fix this so it goes all the way down. Is there a reason why it doesn't? Please let me know as the bank will ask.

comment: Hi [~PramaG]- Ok so far so good. However, please look at page 81 on the PDFwestml11314.2o1_09152022.pdf. The content does not go all the way down like the previous page. Can you please adjust so they match?

Sorry to be a pain but the bank is very concerned about paper waste.

comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com],
Are you mentioning this as not merging?
!image-2022-09-20-14-54-00-764.png!

If it is, then it wouldn't solve the page reduction issue even if it gets merged. Cause I made the bottom section to be stay all together in one page. they won't get fit in the previous page. That's why they went down to bottom page. Now if you tell me to move it up to the previous page. I can do it but it looks bad as 1 or 2 of the lines get scattered to the next page.
Thanks.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: Hi [~fahad]- Please move up. THe bank is more concerned with paper waste than how bad it looks.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: Hi [~fahad]- So just a summary of what is still outstanding along with some updates I made to the SOW...

1. Please provide samples with the verbiage moved up and with the endorsement line.

2. Please also provide a PDF sample of the HOLD statements that will be sent to the SF1 file.

3. Please note, I previously had on the SOW that these would ALL be printed and returned to the bank. That is no longer the case. The bank wants these printed and mailed.

4. The suppressions statements that fit the criteria below is to be sent to the NOP file. We will NOT print or post electronically or include in the PDF archival.

comment: Per Fahad -Dealer loan pdf sample, archival sample (encrypted zip with index file, normal zip, index file) is in /d/ac-secure-share/dsi_print/fahadK/WEST/DLN/Samples/10062022/ We had to change the archival pdf file naming convention because we saw 2 account with same dealer number (8888). As a result one of them overwriting another. To resolve this, we changed the pdf name from 'DEALERNUM_FF00653_DATE.pdf' to 'DEALERNUM_FF00653_DATE_SEQ.pdf' . Let me know if you see any issue.

comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] normally we see things like this when we convert to pdfs and its just font rendering ... usually this changes a bit when you zoom in and out of the pdf. things like this may be more noticeable at different magninfications. On print it should look okay. Similar to this take a look at the "Number" verbiage where is reads "Total Number Loans" there seems to be space between "Nu" and "mber" ... we cant really do much.

comment: [~berezinez]- Updates are...

1. eSup removed (no eStmts)

2. Move "Recycle" statements to "np1" file.

Updated SOW: [http://sharepoint-svr/AS/Shared%20Documents/SOW%20Directory/WEST%20-%20Westamerica%20Bank/SOW/WEST%20Dealer%20Loan%20Statement%20SOW%201.11.22.dotx]

[~fahad]mentioned we don't really need print samples as this update had to do with the suppression.

comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com], [~diegof],
As you've suggested.. I've updated the mailcode again.

FYI [~berezinez], I don't think you would need to do the QA again. Let me know what you think. I've already uploaded the updated project in the qa folder and also updated code is in parallel.
Thanks,
Fahad
