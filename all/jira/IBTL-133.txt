comment: [~William.Kong]: I tried processing this in parallel and I ran into two issues - it prompts me to enter the password for oper1 mid run and its unable to load a shared library (screenshot uploaded).

I'm going to check with Ernest if he can help as well.


author: william.kong
comment: [~nischala.manjunath]: Ernest was informed and I'm going to assign this ticket to him for now.


author: william.kong
comment: [~jasramos]: Just spoke with Ernest. He corrected the print module issue by updating the env_init.sh global script. Can you please re-test.

comment: [~William.Kong] appears reorg processed.A DPVS was created, but there is an error in the log.

DDA & Savings should process after reorg but the processed failed. I'm not sure if DDA & Savings is part of the test, however I provided a snippet of my processing screen. Please see below

comment: [~yameelee] and [~Peter.Dang]: Please look at screenshot #1. I thought we modified production code to not connect to external servers. Please advise why this is being reported.



As for the second screenshot, please I will address this with Anil after you guys are done. Please re-assign to me after you guys ensure there is NO external connections in the production code.

comment: Sorry I commented all ewbb_ftp.pl in ewbb_dda_process.sh, but reorg has a separate call outside of this main script. I removed ftp command from ewbb_ftp.pl and ewbb_xaa_sftp_put.sh.


author: william.kong
comment: [~Peter.Dang]: Thanks Peter for the update. I will keep this ticket assigned to me until Anil fixes the indexfileprocessor issue on production.






author: william.kong
comment: [~jasramos]: Can you re-test today? Network fixed the second issue that you reported. Both issues are now resolved.

comment: [~jasramos],



This error is due to missing paper process for this dt job id.

You will need to rerun with both s,f options.




author: peter.dang
comment: Jason,



Look like the dt_job_id was mixed up or switch between ms1 and ms3.

161486-C01.01-V21329 rerun with different JID. Current CID: ewbb, JID: ms3 - New CID: ewbb, JID: ms1



Please delete the old job from ETA.

verify ms3 and ms1 insert file dt_job id and reprocess.


author: jasramos
comment: [~Peter.Dang]Thanks. 

Job #'s stay the same and the vid changes through ms1,ms3 & ms5. I will be making a request to PC for a full set of dt_job_jobs (ms1,ms2 & ms5). Once received I will reprocess

author: william.kong
comment: [~Tin.Chak]: Any new updates on this issue? Were you guys able to solve this problem? Please advise.


author: 5b1ee5a72eea651bacdeca2e
comment: [~William.Kong] We are still looking into it. The issue is the file size is too big and there's an error at the afp2web Apache that we are trying to fix.


author: william.kong
