Here is the feedback from STAR on the samples:
 # Escrow Transaction History is being cutoff on right margin - see attached screenshot.
 # Can we add page numbers/counters to the top right above the date - see attached example.
 # Can the logo be added to all subsequent pages (they are seeing the logo only on page 1 and 2, but not the 3rd)?
 # Can you add the Equal Housing and Member FDIC logos to the bottom of the page? (Let me know if you need the actual images of these to add).
 # In the top right corner, can the date itself and the loan # itself be right justified to align? (similar to the mapping doc and same attached example as provided for item #1.

Note:

I need the graphic resource for item 4 and the equal housing verbiage.

Please add to the bottom right corner (side by side, EHL logo first) of every page. Thank you!

comment: [~andyp] STAR has 3 more cosmetic changes they would like to request. Please confirm what is possible:
 # Decrease statement header font size by 2 points (if it could be just 1 pt larger than the font size used for the body of the statement). - reference screenshot for item 1
 # Bold the words "Projections for the Coming Year and corresponding column headings below; use same text size as the Statement Headers and Escrow Transaction History headers. - reference screenshot for item 2.
 # Bold 'Escrow Transaction History and make it 1 pt smaller; also bold the Column Headings. - reference screenshot for item 3
 # Provide example for statements with header "Initial Disclosure*".*

Thanks,

Phoebe

Tye was assigned this on the ISD side but he is out this entire week, so I'm covering for him. If there is a new index file, please let me know instead. Otherwise if the index file is generated next week, then you can let Tye know since he should be back by then.

Thanks,
Shun
