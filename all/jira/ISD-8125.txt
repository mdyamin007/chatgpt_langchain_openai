comment: I tested API call on production with internal swagger page for an account with analysis statements posted. They weren't showing up in the API results.



I then checked InfoConfig to see if an archivalPeriod and Statements tabs had an analysis statement type created. It didn't. So I created it and then tested the API call again.

Analysis statements showed up after.
