comment: [~Azad] We have created a new Jira ticket to continue the setup for the electronic portion of the STAR HSA and IRA eStatements.

IS has created new index files, can you post these to the pilot site?

IRA ISD Index:ys1_20211231_1_20220218_0432_star.txt
 HSA ISD Index:ys2_20211231_1_20220218_0356_star.txt

Thank you!

comment: [~sahossain] Is it possible to load this to pilot today? I believe it was already setup on the ISD side during the original project, but we had put on hold after the first set of index files were already loaded. Let me know if possible to load today still. Thank you!

comment: [~sahossain] Thank you! I tried to search for account numbers to view on pilot before informing STAR, but could not see the accounts on the InfoTrac pilot site. Can you confirm if any issues that may need to be updated to be viewable on pilot? Thanks!

It was a data-related issue. It is ok now. 
Please take a look.

comment: To QA,

HSA(ys2) and IRA(ys1) are moved to stage.

You can use the following files or create new oneto test HSA and IRA.

y*s1_20211231_1_20220218_0432_star.txt*

*ys2_20211231_1_20220218_0356_star.txt*

These will be processed via Document processing.

Index file and zip file are already on place. Run the job with 'Parallel Run' checked to process on test mode.

STAR does not use Hypercube. The statements can only be viewed from InfoTRAC only.

Thanks!
