I've created some internal bounceback report for the last 30 days. Each cycle should generate an individual report differentiated by seg_id when the report is run on the same day.

The file path is/d/infoftps3/SEFC/bounceback/

I need to clarify on how the internal bounceback report is generated and propose a new file naming convention.

The ISD side can't distinguish job_id under the same application (E-notices in this case), so when generating the report, we could only do it per application and generate the report per dt_job_id. There is a similar setup in production for Mortgage Statements (ML1 and ML3), and below is how the generated report for July.

sefc_ml1_undeliverable_174949-C16.01-V22380_1_07242022_050009.txt

sefc_ml3_undeliverable_174949-C16.01-V22380_1_07242022_050013.txt
sefc_ml1_undeliverable_175126-C01.01-V23120_2_07242022_050009.txt

sefc_ml3_undeliverable_175126-C01.01-V23120_2_07242022_050013.txt

The reports are generated in a way of each combination of job_id and dt_job_id, since ISD end could not distinguish job_id when pulling for the same application (mortgage statement in this case). So two of the four files above is incorrect combination. You will need to search by job_id and dt_job_id when to find the correct report to use.



When it comes to E-Notices (dlc, dld, dle, ar1), one dt_job_id would have four report generated,

dlc_dt_job_id, dld_dt_job_id, dle_dt_job_id and ar1_dt_job_id, but only one report is the correct combination.

For the last batch of test file I provided, all dt_job_id are for dlc, because there are no bounceback records for other job_id.

Please let me know if you need further clarification.

comment: [~eric.yan] - I couldn't access this folder. And there should be 3 files - batch, one-off and arm notice.

Thanks!

comment: [~eric.yan] - found the files in /z/isd_input/I3/process-files/sefc. But it has only batch and one-off. Can you please create one for arm notice? Arm notice index file is ar1_20220525_1_20220824_1034_sefc.txt and I ran it on 24th.

Thanks!

There is still some issue in the report generator in the staging env, so I manually recreated the bounced back reports. It's still under the same file names but with updated account numbers.
