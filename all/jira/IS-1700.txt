Sounds like a potential issue - The Logo does not have the return address
See below

comment: [~billr] [~Igor.Khosid],

The letter is created fromthe "ELCU_MA_Cover Letter.pdf". We need to modify this PDF to modify the letter output. If we need to change the logo, is it okay to remove the logo+address on top and replace an logo from an existing app? If not, please ask customer if they can add it and adjust it to correct location to fit the envelope.

existing logo on app:

Jun, on ticket 34321 I showed the client the return address issue and they are asking do we want to move the address below the logo or should IDCU do it?

comment: [~billr]

Would it be ok to replace the logo+address in"ELCU_MA_Cover Letter.pdf" with the logo in the previous comment I attached?
