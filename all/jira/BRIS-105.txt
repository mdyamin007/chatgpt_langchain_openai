title: ca-rtitan-pr-01: ISWK_New (Cloned VM) Setup/Configuration
description: *Summary:*

This is the cloned version of the ISWK_New (10.8.9.67).



*Server Specifications:*
 * Server Name:
 ** {color:#172b4d}ca-rtitan-pr-01.infoimageinc.com{color}
 * CPU: 2 Core (temporarily)
 * Mem: 4GB
 * Disk Partition:
 ** Clone entire C:\
 ** D:\ Keep empty but allocate 200GB; Will have to increase close to 2TB when we have brisbane server.
 *** Please apply clone the same "user" share permissions on D:\{color}
 *** {color:#de350b}Please add a folder called 'k'. Please enable sharing to this folder with 'rhlogin' user read/write access.{color}

 * 
 ** [https://app.smartsheet.com/sheets/V9xwHXJPFF9m375vQ6QcH4H953WMRvh7RJ3R6J31]



*Specifications:*
 * New Server IP:
 ** ca-redtitan-pr-01.infoimageinc.com
 * Verify if RedTitan License works (i.e. Is RedTitan useable) ; If not, work with RedTitan to get a test license; Please ask if license is tied to CPU or VM; If tied to CPU, then we have to wait until 4/1 to test RedTitan.
 * Verify the system partition structure is ok. I asked Prem to only clone the C:\ Partition. I explicitly asked not to include the other partitions. If other partitions are needed, please let me (Will K.) know so that I can document this and request Prem too make the adjustments.
 * Also, please help me verify that the user accounts are setup correctly as well; (i.e. We want to make sure Neil/DP can run jobs
 * Note: D:\ is being added right now and will be empty; I will create a separate subtask and assign another person to work on syncing the directory;

comment: [~premraj.patil]: Please re-assign back to me when it is done. I need to sync the directory structure before re-assigning back to Ernest to test.

comment: [~premraj.patil]: four things:



#1. Can you please fix the ca-redtitan-pr-01 DNS to point to 10.4.18.122

#2. I updated a spec above in red. Can you clone the same windows user share permission for D:\

#3. Change the name from ca-redtitan-pr-01 to ca-rtitan-pr-01 based on the 15byte limitation issue on Windows that you just reported.

#4.  Please update local DNS as well.

comment: [~premraj.patil]: 

Two items to address:
 # Issue writing files to D:\ ; I don't have permission to write. Can you confirm that rh1login has permissions to write

!image-2020-03-09-07-46-41-200.png!



2.  I need to add more detail to my original specifications. Please add folder "k" in to D:\; Please share this directory as I need to mount in the D:\k folder directly. I've updated the description above with red font.

comment: Per meeting clarification last week and the updated Brisbane server list. We will NOT be using the "cloned" version of the ISWK servers. All of the physical ISWK Menlo servers will be physically to Brisbane.



So this task is CANCELLED
