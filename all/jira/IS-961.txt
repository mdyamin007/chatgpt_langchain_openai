No approval yet.


author: william.kong
comment: [~Kbittmann]: Approval date of 5/6 is missed. This project requires parallel time. Once job is approved, we will need to revisit the timeline before running parallel.

We just got approval from WFCU on this item. Please provide an updated timeline.


author: william.kong
comment: [~zhuoxinT]: Please get this over to [~Igor.Khosid]to QA. We will need to ask when QA will finish so that we can provided revised timeline.



[~Igor.Khosid]: FYI. Please advise when QA can be completed.



[~Kbittmann]: Depending [~Igor.Khosid]'s response after [~zhuoxinT]submits to QA, I think the earliest maybe early next week once this passes parallel. I think this is a once a month job so it will be no later than EOM 5/31/2022.

comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid], [~Andrey.Kutsenko],

[~zhuoxinT]is changing the backer. So it's not related to first page. Please pass this project. If[~Kbittmann]wants to update, we need separate request.

Thanks
