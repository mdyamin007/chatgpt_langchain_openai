1. 5 hours for formatting

 10 for preprocessing script to parse the XML files to flat file.

  - XML data files

  - All secondary reference file.

3. In looking at the mappings provided, in secion D "Rate Limits" paragraph, it appears to be incomplete. See attached.

comment: [~eric.yan] Thanks, the pilot looks good. I'll inform IDCU for final approval. Thanks!

comment: [~eric.yan] Part of IDCU's feedback was he believed this application should be its own 'tab' on the e-site.

I checked Daphne's original ticket and it is referencing #24323 (comment #54).

Is it possible since we are treating this as it's own application, can it be posted on it's own 'tab' as well?

Please let me know if best to had an internal call to discuss.

comment: [~phoebe.george],

After reading the ticket comment (referencing #24323 comment #54), I'm afraid there might be some miscommunication.

TheEscrow Statement (ea1) is being set up as a "statement" type, so it has its own tab and email template. But the "ARM Letter" is being set up as a "Letter/Notice", which is grouped into one tab and shares the same email template.

If stand-along email template is desired, then the "ARM Letter" needs to be set up as a "statement" and it means a whole different route of setup on the print side.

The arm letter has been posted to stage admin site for review.


author: eric.yan
comment: update define.jspf in dev.

The application needs to be ran as "statement" job instead of "notice".

The afp needs to be copied to the/d/INPUT-DEV/indiv_afp/idcu/afp-archive/ folder instead of the enotice folder.

Can you please post the ARM Letter to pilot? We need client to be able to review on pilot site but IMP does not have access to staging.

Thank you,

comment: Hi [~eric.yan],



Thank you for new tab on pilot! Client has confirmed it is what they wanted. The one thing they would ask to modify though: it is the name of the tab please, because thy think the format is causing some issues with Alkimi. 
Please change the title of the tab to *ARM Letter*. Capital on A, R, M and them capital L with no plural s

Thank you,

It's updated to "ARM Letter" tab name.


author: JIRAUSER11300
comment: Thank you, [~eric.yan]

Client has responded thatit still shows *Arm Letter* on his end.

Could you please verify? Not sure if this is just something on client side?

Thank you,
Juliana

It's updated now. Please have the client verified.

Please note we have received a feedback/update from the client and there will be a certain delay from CU side.

Once we meet with them on 7/15, we will discuss internally the new timeline dates.

Pilot Online Proofing Sample Issue

The proofing index file has a different file name than the actual pdf file.

PROC ID is 968027

The proofing index file is

/z/isd_share/idcu/print_fileid/idcudlh12120220720095406.prf.txt

and the indicated pdf file isidcudlh121.prf.pdf.20220720095406



But the actual pdf file in folder has a different name

!image-2022-07-20-17-38-36-043.png|width=849,height=100!



Further checking on the rhs (stage) server, it has the same proofing pdf files as RHT server (pilot)

comment: [~eric.yan] I think you forgot to commit your conf file changes for the new prefix dlh and app type arm_ltr onto pilot. Please remember to commit and deploy those changes onto each environment when necessary.

[~Igor.Khosid] Fyi in case you continue to see certain posting issues.

The final samples are approved by the client. I renamed them and attach herewith:

I think we have talked about this on the phone right?

Everything should be ready. For the alignment discrepancy, please ask IS to reexport the dfa to the QA folder.
