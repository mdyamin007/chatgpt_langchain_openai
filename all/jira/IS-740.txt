Hi Enrico,

When following the mapping for S Record (Transactions), I'm not getting the expected output. Not many accounts have S records. The first 2 I have encountered don't make sense, especially the description. This what I get when I follow the mapping.

ACCOUNT 289520

EFFECTIVE DATE = 0

DESCRIPTION = 45000012017

ESCROW ACTIVITY = 0

ADVANCED FEES = 0

PAYMENTS = 7500



ACCOUNT 298752

EFFECTIVE DATE = 211130

DESCRIPTION = 43102111301

ESCROW ACTIVITY = 0

ADVANCED FEES = 0

PAYMENTS = 0

The way CHFA app gets the description is like this:

For RECORD S, 32-37 COMP - 3 returns a string of digits, and then they append the first two digits to the last digit. For example, account # 289520 description45000012017 will have a code of 745. Then they use that 3 digit code to find the description in a table. There are 52 entries in the table. If there is no match, the description defaults to "Payment". In this case, code 745 does not yield a match so it defaults to "Payment".

For account # 298752, description 43102111301 has a code of 143. Code 143 returns a description of "Adjustment".

Hope this helps.

comment: [~andreav]I attached a new DPVS for samples, please useCORRECT_DPVS_SNFBML3.pdf. I just realized I needed to modify PRISMA to pull the eform using the new snfbml3 prefix. This is done.
