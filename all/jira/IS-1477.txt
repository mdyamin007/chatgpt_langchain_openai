1. Update processing script to use below file naming conventions - this was the originally proposed names:
 OUTER FILE:
 colu_stmt_mmddyyyy.zip.pgp

The inside files should be named:
 MM_STMXT_STDL_mmddyyyy.txt
 MM_STMXT_NEW_STDL_mmddyyyy.txt

2. Update processing script to pickup file from 'stmt' sub-folder in the FTP directory.

3. Setup/finalize processing script for print and PDF Archival (both Fiserv 'E' option and Nautilus 'e' option) for DP to process.
 - Program will account for increase in account volumes based on how the PDF batches are generated.

comment: Note for QA:

for item #3( Setup/finalize processing script for print and PDF Archival (both Fiserv 'E' option and Nautilus 'e' option) for DP to process.)

When processing archival options 'e' or 'E' both run the same thing with the exception of white text formatting at the top of the page in the pdfs. Nautilus format (running with option 'e')  and Fiserv's format (running with option 'E') both with be exported to their own respective folders in /z/pdf_afp/colu/colums1/<nautilus or fiserv>/ . These files are not deleted between each run, unless removed manually, and are incremented since colu has two data files for both colums1 and colums2 for regular/RegE data formats.

[~Ricky Lopez] Please message Colton to check the QA issue that Gnana reported last night when he is online/available.

Please also prep the parallel test forms ahead of time as we will need to submit as a rush once QA is completed.
