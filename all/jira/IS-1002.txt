Questions:

whenever the *Earnings Term* appears the *The new rate is not yet....* verbiage doesn't appear.

In that case what to do with this message:

Please see information and attachment from client.

I realized that I needed to make a change to the data file, and move the two new data fields to a different location. Removing the verbiage was going to cause a problem, becau[^NOTICES0000.DAT]se of the way that verbiage was used conditionally on the notices. I have placed the new fields them at the bottom of each CD maturity notice. The current conditioning would need to stay in place, plus these two new fields.

Please see client feedback and attachments.



We have reviewed and do*not*approve. Please see attached docs and make the following changes:

The first page of the maturity notice appears to be correct, however, the second page is not accurate. Attached are the disclosures InfoImage should be using. These copies are the last set we received from InfoImage and I made some corrections to both. Please have them update the 2^nd^page disclosure and send back through for review.[^EQBK current Daily Letter 001 - updated_EQBK edit.docx]

Client says that the notices are not correct.  Please see below.  We have the production cycles since Friday on hold.

The notifications are not accurate. The maturity notices for both regular CDs and the IRA files are missing the below statement on how often the interest will compound and be credited to the account.   

See attached for additional details [^CD Maturity Notices.docx]

Is there any ts for this? I also need the cycle to test.
