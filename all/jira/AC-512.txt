can you create a Jira story for this issue?

also can you confirm which Minor Codes with Major code "CML" are "commercial loan" and "commercial line of credit"?

The final edit request would be updating "Mortgage Statement" to "Commercial Mortgage Statement" so it is consistent with the others.

Could your team update the template with that change? Everything else looks great!
