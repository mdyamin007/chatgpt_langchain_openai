comment: [~Tin.Chak] Sorry, we missed creating a story for this, although the Epic was created on 10/6!

Can you assign and confirm if we can shift the timeline to start today instead; estimated 1 week to complete based on the ticket.

comment: [~phoebe.george] I've enabled the automatic email trigger for enotices. Do you happen to know when the next enotice cycle is expected to come in? If so, I can keep a lookout for that to confirm that it is working as intended.

comment: [~phoebe.george] I also noticed there are a few enotice email jobs still waiting to be sent out from the past couple months, although looking at the accts posted they've all been only on paper so no emails would send out anyway. Should we keep them as is or remove them?

comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] thanks for the update on this; yes, we can remove the previous batches over the past couple of months, we do not need to release any of the previous email notifications.

I don't know the exact dates of when these notice files arrive, but I get the file arrival notifications so I can inform you when they do arrive. Thank you!

Thanks,

Phoebe

comment: Thanks [~phoebe.george], I've removed those past email jobs as well. I'll close out this story if that's ok, since the automatic email flag is standard just like for other clients so I don't foresee any issues with it.
