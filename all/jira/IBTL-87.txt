comment: [~jasramos]: Did you scan the data into the ftpscanner? (i.e. place the data file into /z/infoftp_int/$cid/.../.../ folder?

I'm suspecting this file was not scanned hence you got the scanner error.

Please let me know your results. Thanks!

comment: [~William.Kong] Scanned the files though and the process completed successfully. No errors.

Daily A & B utilizes the same script "/home/master/fcsb_process.sh", I didn't temporarily move Daily B's file out the processing folder, so the process has a combination of A & B files. Since they use the same script, can we disregard IBTL-88?

comment: 

[~jasramos]: I will close the ticket and ibtl-88.
