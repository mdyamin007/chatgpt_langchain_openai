Estimate 15hrs to add DDA250 to Business Analysis Statement (BA1) - not sure if will need ISD hours since these should still be considered as 1 statement (ba1) and post together.



Assessment for IS:
Set up DDA250 and combine it with the DDA750 as Business Analysis Statement. DDA250 should be first page when exists with DDA750 as subsequent pages.

 -There can be stand alone DDA750 statements.

 -There CAN NOT be any DDA250 standalone. If there is any, output to a report and place in client pickup. --> should we do this at script level before going through isisdisk_daily.sh?



update to scripts: 4hrs

(because currently DDA750 is a singlestatementusing isisdisk.sh, we have to update the script to use isisdisk_daily.sh to do combine (householding))

1. add DDA250 to /home/master/msbkdl_split_data.pl to split to Business BU folder - 1hr

2. update /home/master/msbk_ba1_process.sh - 3hr

  -to add letter DDA250

  -go through format_only.sh for each data file

  -combine the data files and go through isisdisk_daily.sh instead of isisdis.sh



update control files: 2hr

1. add control file msbkba001.dfa

2. add control file msbkba002.dfa

3. update control file msbkba1.control to not include format dfa etc

  -add group_type to for householding.



update to DFA: 6hrs

1. change MSBKBA11.dfa (DDA750) as a notice with letter code (ex. BA002.dfa) - 1hr

  -remove estmt options as it should not generate estmt from here anymore

2. set up new DDA250 as a new letter code (BA001.dfa) using mockupnew_MSBK DDA250- Mock up.docx - 3hrs

  - use BA001.dfa as this is supposed to be first page if combined with DDA750 so the letter code should come first

3. update MSBKBA21.dfa to take in letter codes and combine them (check if DDA250 is stand alone then output to report - if not done so on script) - 2hr

  -update MSBKBA21.dfa to generate estmt for combined Business Analysis as ba1



Testing and QA: 3hrs

 -need to test to make sure the householding is correct as well as formatting etc.
