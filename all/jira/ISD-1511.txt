comment: On Webapp-prod09 & Webapp-prod10
Uncomment out BKCU, KFCU, SSCU from tomcat-cu/conf server.xml
Restart tomcat-cu
In hostfile, add 10.8.9.169 & 10.8.9.170 tied to each cid's prod url.
Try hitting each cid's prod url with the port number :9880/ appended to the url.

For SSCU, BKCU, there were other records in the host file, had to comment out.

Checked the access logs on prod09 & prod10, saw the traffic.

Looks good.

Jenkins is set up for each of these clients as well.

BKCU might not get migrated depending on how long we'll be hosting their site for.
