In looking at the second round sample data, there seem to be an issue below in red.

In the first set of data, only the last 4 digits was provided. However, in this second round, all account numbers are showing. Also, there appear a tick/apostrophe preceding it which does not look right.

Attached is the data file.

Please advise.
