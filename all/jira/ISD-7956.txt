title: MVCU - Business Loan eStatement Setup 
description: Set-up electronic statements for MVCU Business Loan Statements.

These statements will appear under the current/existing 'eStatement' tab.

Print is already live; IS also completed portion for electronic setup; will have DP run for eStatement index file to attach for pilot site testing.

New prefix ml4

comment: [~phoebe.george] The description mentions IS completed their portion, does that mean we already validated index file postings for this? I need to configure the index file prefix before DP posts onto pilot.

Also once DP does post the index files onto pilot, can we get some kind of sample statement to compare against? QA might need that for their testing.

comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] Yes, sorry for confusion. IS had set this up previously. I can have test process in pilot in order to generate an index file if you haven't requested this already.

I can attach a current sample to this ticket so that QA can use for comparison. Thanks!

comment: [~phoebe.george] Thanks, please ask DP to post onto pilot.

comment: Index file prefix ml4 configured on lower environments and index file posted onto pilot, however there are issues viewing statements on the sites. Currently having DSI research.

comment: Hi [~phoebe.george], is the client still reviewing this on pilot?


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] Pilot site is approved now.

Let me know next steps to proceed.



Thanks!

comment: [~phoebe.george] I added the prefix ml4 onto stage so that the index file posts, I can see the statements on the admin site. Typically I would pass it to QA and have them verify that the accounts in the ml4 index file posted successfully onto the admin site (which I checked already), however should they also check the contents of the estatement itself? If so, then I believe there is a few things QA would need in order to verify, which I think IS usually provides.

comment: [~phoebe.george] Fyi I also coincidentally noticed that there have been ml4 index files failing to post on our production PUI almost every day for the past few months because the prefix is not added yet on our end. Not sure if those need to be reposted after we release this new prefix. 

Side note, DP requested to enable automatic emails for mvcu stmt, which have prefix ms3. Since ml4 is supposed to be under the same tab, automatic emails will also apply for ml4 once the prefix is added to production.
