Pending SANA feedback


author: william.kong
comment: [~barnetts]: Just a courtesy reminder. Approvals are due today. Please ensure it is not late.


author: william.kong
comment: [~barnetts]: Project live date is today and we have not received approvals. This project will have to be delayed until next year if we cannot rush and get everything completed before EOD. If we do not go live by EOD, I will change project status to be on "Hold". When client is ready, we can schedule a revised live date next year.

SANA is wanting the pdfs samples along with the Index. Can you please advise is this is possible? 

Thanks, Barnett


author: william.kong
comment: [~barnetts]: This project is past due. I will ask [~thomasY]to share the PDF samples along with the index file. Please bear in mind, between now and until end of January, we will not be able to promptly respond to this project. Live date will need to be revisit for February 2022.



[~thomasY]: Per our conversation, please assist with above. I will change the live date later today to sometime in Feb 2022.

comment: *BARNETT:* As stated above, the live date is missed. Target live date is in February timeframe, but I will mark it for 1/24*+tentatively+* for project management purposes. If his tax workload is not as high, then we will get this project out earlier. However, if the Tax support is significantly high, we will reschedule for sometime in Feb 2022.



Also, please keep the communication going with this project so we are not at a complete stop. If there is any wiggle room we will respond, but not as fast as we normally do.
