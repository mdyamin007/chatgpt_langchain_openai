description: Assessment:If "Hold" is found in the address, suppress from print entirely.

comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com],

I updated the program and ran the process using latest production data fileBKPL_StudentChecking_100622.zip.gpg

But this data don't have any customer that has "HOLD" verbiage in address.

Please provide a production data file that has HOLD verbiage in address.

Or should I use the data file that is attached to TS 34678? I don't know if it is good to use for providing sample.

*IMPORTANT*: I noticed in the TS data, the HOLD verbiage is surrounded by star sign * like following : *HOLD*

So in the program, i looked for exactly *HOLD* verbiage, instead of searching just "HOLD" because someone's name could be "Michel Holden".

Thanks

comment: [~mahbubS]- Yes, please use the data in 34678. And yes, it will appear as "*HOLD*" in the data.

I ran the process using the TS 34678 data.

The customer with HOLD address have been print suppressed.

Those customer info are diverted to nop file.[^bkpldnb4285.nop]

DPVS also has their entry. I attached the DPVS.[^bkpldnb428.print]

Thanks

Please start qa on this.

Project is in qa folder:/d/iss/qa/BKPL/BKPLDN109.zip

parallel ID:20221027041632

DPVS attached:[^bkpldnb428.print]

No print range needed because this is a suppression related update.

Just Need to check if address has the "*HOLD*" verbiage, then those customer get entry in nop file and DPVS also has entry of them.

Thanks

It's better to have a parallel. If time is too short for this task then we can skip parallel.

Otherwise please create a parallel ticket.

Thanks


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~mahbubS]- no time for parallel. This was a simple update so please provide rollout instructions for onshore to do this week.

comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com],

It may look simple update for you. But the consequences for this update matters to us. This is a suppression logic update. If suppression doesn't work as expected thenfor example, statement may get delivered to a person who was not supposed to have any. And in the end, the blame would be on us.

Anyway, I will prepare for release today.

Thanks
