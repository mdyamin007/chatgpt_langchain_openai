This is inhouse update for year end. Could you please postpone sample date to 11/19 and live date to 11/30? Because Eric got a few rush jobs from client requests.



Thanks,

Tun

comment: Hi [~barnetts] and [~Igor.Khosid] ,

Sorry for the delay. I was able to incorporate the archival process to the processing script. However, it could not be ran as individual options as it gets other upstream script involved and might affect other application.

The format, contents and naming convention of pdf and index files are not changed.

Old archival: /d/pdf_afp/sscu/sscutax/indv_pdf_tax_forms/sscu_5498fmv_1/FMV 100113839-60 568-93-7197_4091.IDX

/d/pdf_afp/sscu/sscutax/indv_pdf_tax_forms/sscu_5498fmv_1/FMV 100113839-60 568-93-7197_4091.PDF

New archival: /z/pdf_afp/sscu/sscutax/pdf/FMV 100114118-80 615-05-3871_257.IDX

 /z/pdf_afp/sscu/sscutax/pdf/FMV 100114118-80 615-05-3871_257.PDF



FMV arhival naming convention is the same as other sucu standard tax archival now:

/z/pdf_afp/sscu/sscutax/zip/SSCU_5498FMV_281_2020.zip

cid_formtype_cycle no(segment)_tax year.zip



Print and etax steps and output are not changed.

comment: [~eric.yan]: Per our conversation, you changed the zip file naming convention. If we changed the specs, we need client to agree. Please speak with Barnett to check with client if it is ok. If not, please circle back with [~TunA]to discuss.

comment: [~barnetts]

After this change, the naming convention of the archival is updated to match the other standard tax archival naming format.

SSCU_5498FMV_021_2021.zip

cid_form name_(cycle #)(seg #)_year.zip

The pdf and index files remain the same.

Please confirm with the client they are ok with the updated naming convention.

The code is released this morning. I've also updated the procedure for DP. DP could PM me for question if they have any question during the run.
