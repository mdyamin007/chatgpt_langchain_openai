title: OFCU - [21150][pvt] Daily eStatements enrollments Setup
description: OFCU - Daily eStatements enrollments Setup

Description:Update the customer's enrollment status on a daily basis instead of having it updated monthly through the statement file.

*Specs*: Unique User ID | Account Number | Account Name | Status | Email | Modified Date
*Unique User ID*: This will just be the Member Number.
*Account Number*: This is the Member Number.
*Account Name*: The Member Name.
*Status*: The delivery preference:*P*(aper) or*E*(lectronic)
*Email*: Email address required to enroll into Electronic preference. Can be left empty if the status is*P*.
*Modified Date*: The enrollment time in Unix Epoch Time.

*Example:*
12345|12345|John Doe|E|john.doe@email.com|1625846715
44444|44444|Jane Doe|P||1625846715

The Modified Date is used to determine whether the process should update the Delivery Preference. For example, if the Modified Date represent July 9 at 7:00 a.m. and the file is processed on July 9 at 8 a.m. the process will check to see if there were any user choices after 7:00 a.m. Maybe the user has logged on and already changed the delivery preference at 7:45 a.m. Because of this, the delivery preference from the file will be skipped, since we do not want to override the user-choice at 7:45 a.m.

Alternatively, we can opt to not have Modified Date, and use the Processing Time as the benchmark, i.e. if the file is processed at 8 a.m. then we would only skip if we discover any user's choice that occurs after 8 a.m.

Setup will be 5 hours.

*Timeline*
Turnover: 9/16
Pilot: 9/29
Live: 11/12

I noticed that the status and email header is swapped. The specs has it as*Status | Email.*

But in the file, the format is in*Email* *|**Status.*****
