title: 30743 - Remove Quarterly eNewsletter Insert Link
description: # Check Database for the Quarterly Insert LInk. If it's there find out how it gets created. - Findings: There was nothing in the insert_info database table on this. I did check and noticed there were selective piece_codes, but wasn't able to find out what it was related to.
 # Check the SLCU Code to see if it's permanent coding. - Findings: I was able to find the code inside acctdetails.jsp in both msm and root folders for slcu-brisbane. We can manually remove this code on msm and root. Lines in msm: 560-567 if (quarterEnd.contains(closing.substring(0, 5))) \{ %> <tr> <td class="contentsm" align="left" nowrap>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.selco.org/eNewsletter" target="_blank">SELCO eNewsletter: On the Quarter</a></td> </tr> <% } Lines in root: 113 HashMap quarterMap=new HashMap(2); Lines in root: 148-153 if(quarterEnd.contains(closing.substring(0, 5)))\{ mapDocInfo.put("hasInserts", "true"); quarterMap.put("insertPath", "https://www.selco.org/eNewsletter"); quarterMap.put("title", "SELCO eNewsletter: On the Quarter"); insertList.add(quarterMap); }
