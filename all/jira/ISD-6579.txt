comment: [~dawnl] the sample statement is now updated on pilot, please have the client verify. Attached screenshot pfcu_enrollment_sample.PNG to this story for reference. If the client cannot see it initially, please have them try clearing their cache or using a different browser before re-attempting.

If they need some sample members to test with, here's a few:

101142
101144
101146

comment: Hi Igor,

This is an update to the sample enrollment pdf displayed during the enrollment steps. Please login to SSO stage and verify. You should land on the disclosure as the first page and the sample pdf should be on the next page. Please verify that it matches the sample.pdf attached to the ticket. Should be fairly straightforward to check, before the update there was no 'Sample Statement' written in big letters across the page.

Here are some members you can test with:
101142
101146
101120

Thanks,
Shun
