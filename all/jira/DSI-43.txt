comment: it's datatable issue. Need to have null check in front end. This is happening when contact data is returning null from response.

comment: Actually we need to fix the API to return the expected data. As this client setup uses npLinkType byUSR, there is no account id in np table. In such case API should look for ufa table and send np accordingly.
