title: 39968 - HFCU New Client Setup - SSO Email Config
description: With a property, we need to disable the updating of email addresses. 

If a member logins in for the first time, we will use that email to create the NP. 

Subsequent logins wont make any changes to the emails.



Please work with Surekha on this, and see what is necessary.
