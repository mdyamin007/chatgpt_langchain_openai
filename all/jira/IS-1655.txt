My apologies,

FRST dropped 4 AFS Annual Borrower Statements PDFs and Index files at below location. Can you confirm if we received them?

comment: [~kdishroon]I do not see any files, I also checked the logs and no file was sent over. Just an FYI, since I don't have the files yet, I'm going to add a day to the original sample day for every day that the test files are late.

comment: Hi [~kdishroon] ,

I was able to download files from link provided by FRST in the email. I have also updated the timeline by 11 days since that's how long it took to receive the files

Sample to client: 10/26/2022

Client approve by: 10/31/2022

comment: Hi [~kdishroon], I have successfully tested all 5 test files. However the sample files are too large in size to attach to Jira, therefore I have placed a zip named "FRST_ANNUAL_SAMPLE_2022.zip" in your share folder. I have also copied it over to the FRST client_pickup/test/ folder.

comment: Hi [~rodriguez] - Are they on secure 3 or secure 4?


author: rodriguez
comment: Hi[~kdishroon]I placed them in both. However, they are not there anymore since they get deleted after 5 days. Therefore I have placed them in both again.

comment: Hi [~rodriguez] - Client approved the samples; can you confirm the following 2 items?


 # Fee Charge code key will be added as backer in the statement?
 # Samples you sent are print copies. We will also be getting individual PDFs with Index files back for our OnBase correct ?


author: rodriguez
comment: Hi [~kdishroon]
 # Yes the Fee Charge code will be added as a backer in the statement, the Fee Code was in the samples provided.
 # Yes they will be getting multiple zips with individual pdf's. However, index file was never included for this app. It is not in the code and SOW states that an index file is not needed. Please see below. Also, the zip file naming convention needs to be updated in SOW to include the segment since we send multiple zips.

comment: [~Igor.Khosid]There was no change made to this app. FRST discontinued this app but then decided to continue. All we had to do was "turn back on" the app, however app was never "turned off". We just had to run a few test files which client approved.

comment: Hi [~rodriguez], - Since we are just turning the app back on, can we skip parallel?
