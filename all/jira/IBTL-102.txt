Can you check this. William said this job is in BB parallel.

comment: Cesar,

Can you check with PC if they set the correct bin for the inserts for DT_JOB_ID:161473-C00.01-V20058 ?  According to the insert file, bin 1 is set to all.

comment: Le,

Per PC, the insert file is updated correctly, please advise.

comment: Ceasar,
Per Caroline, there are not inserts.
Please remove the weight from insert bin 1 and try again.

Thanks.

comment: Le,

It failed again with the same error even if we removed the weight on bin#1.
