comment: [~jun], please see feedback from RWCU:

Per the business unit:

the "no advisor" (rwcudl013_Samples_100521) letter to add more spaces between the closing and the disclosure (see attached). Also, the body of the letter is 12 point font and the disclosure should be 9 point font.

The "has advisor" (rwcudlD_Samples_100521) letter just needs to have the body of the letter in 12 point font and the disclosure in 9 point font.

In looking at the samples, the font size appears to be the same for the body of the letter and the disclosure.

I have attached a sample Document ("Maturing CD Letter No Advisor_#1507 REVISED 10-6-2021") again as an example of the Disclosure font size.

Can you provide new samples?

Thanks!

It looks like we can bypass parallel. Can you confirm when code can be released?
Thanks!
