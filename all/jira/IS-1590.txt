title: SURU Electricity Statement File Processing Update
description: SURU Electricity Statement File Processing Update

InfoIMAGE to update scripts to NOT combine Electricity files any longer. Each file will be processed separately and posted to AOLP. SURU will also be updating the naming conventions. They will be sent as "SURU_electricity_stmt_XXXXX_XXXX_XXXXX_<MMDDYY>_<HHMMSS>.txt". Please note, the "XXXXX_XXXX_XXXXX" will be dynamic. This part can be 5-20 characters. InfoIMAGE to process and post the file name to InfoTrac Job Status screen as it does today (user needs to click on blue hyperlink to pull up file name).

Please setup on CRON to pull all files at once and process each one separately.

ALL will use the Electricity statement template.

Please see attached test file.

comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]

Need to reconfirm below things:

Paper, e-statement, and archival all are applicable for this right?

And there could be multiple data files at the same time which we need to pick and process one after another. Will the cycle date be the same between multiple data files? If it can be the same then the output actually will be replaced by each other.



Thanks

Would you please attach the test file, and sow link?



Thanks

comment: Hi [~rony]- Done. Yes, Paper, eStmt and Archival are all applicable.



And yes, they may send data files with the same cycle date. Can we use segment numbers to process each one so they don't get overwritten?


author: rony
comment: Hi Stephen,

2 ways to do that,

Either Dp needs to run manually each file one at a time, each time they will run they will provide the segment as argument to the script or

Customer data should have segment numbers 1,2,3.......



Let me know which one is convenient. For me, the 2nd one is better because Dp doesn't need to worry about running each file.



Thanks

Any feedback on my previous comment?



Thanks

comment: Hi [~rony]- Question was sent to SURU. I'm hoping they can add the segment number but will confirm.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: Hi [~rony]- SURU won't be able to add the segment number. So we'll have to go with -Dp needs to run manually each file one at a time, each time they will run they will provide the segment as argument to the script
