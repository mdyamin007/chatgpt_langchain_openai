title: PUI - Duplicate Checksum Validation Update
description: The current checksum validation logic traces back records up to 12 months. But there are recent incidents where different data file generated index files with the same checksum values as old files more than 6 months ago.

This update is to change the tracing back period to 6 months to bypass those coincident.
