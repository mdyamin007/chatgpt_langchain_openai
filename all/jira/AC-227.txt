comment: Hi [~kdishroon],

Just a reminder, please make sure to create 6 separate IS Stories for following applications. So that, different developer can work on different application.

Daily Notices (wtcudla)
Monthly Statements (flat file) (wtcums1)
HELOC (wtcume1)
Loan Coupon (wtculc1)
Master Card (wtcumv2)
Visa (flat file) (wtcumv1)



Thanks,
