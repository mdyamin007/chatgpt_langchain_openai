We need to send this to QA for them to review in order to provide samples to the client by tomorrow. 


author: tanmay
comment: [~jharvey]Please advise

I can not turnover to QA unless this ticket gets resolved https://jira.infoimageinc.com/browse/IS-698

comment: [~Igor.Khosid]

We need to have the samples reviewed by QA before providing to the client for review and approval.  [~tanmay]  is concerned because IS-698 is using the same resources that he isn't able to turn it over to you.  What do we need to do to get these to the client?


author: igor.khosid
comment: [~jharvey] - ready for the client review

The existing current disclosure replaced with the new one >>> SCRA Notice Correct.tif



author: jharvey
comment: [~tanmay]  [~Igor.Khosid]

Client approved samples.

[~tanmay]  Would you please work with Tohid in regards to the release of IS-698?

We need to combine this code release with the project for IS-698. Please work with Tohid in order to make this happen.  We also need it turned over to QA so we are able to get through the parallel and testing in time for live date of 10/25.

Letter 10 will be tested at the same time as IS-698
