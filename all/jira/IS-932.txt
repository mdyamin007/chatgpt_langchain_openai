comment: [~nprimak] [~fahad]

I've analyzed the issues Natasha identified and here are my findings:

*1099oid* -> The index file had 4 accounts and the AFP file name that were listed for those 4 accounts do not exist inside the zip file. Processing UI recognized them as bad data and did not include those on to the database.

*1099c* -> The index file had only 1 account.

Default Infotrac initial start duration property value was 12 months (see the Archival Period calendars on InfoTRAC). So by default it will show the statements which has closing date on the range of 12 months (25 April 2021 to 25 May 2022(_today_)). The statement date which was processed was 31 December 2020, outside of the viewing range. So to view the etax of 2020, one has to update the Start duration to 2020 to view the statement. Please see my two attached screenshot. The second one is showing the tax form on the eTax tab.

!Screenshot from 2022-05-25 14-21-37.png!

!Screenshot from 2022-05-25 14-29-28.png!

If you don't want to manually change this range, InfoTRAC has a property called "initialStartDuration". We can update this value to match the STAR etax archival of 18 months. Then InfoTRAC will initially load the last 18 months statements. This is a business call. So let me know if this change is needed.

*1099nec* -> Same reason as 1099c.

*5498* -> Same reason as 1099c. The IRA tax one that Natasha saw on IRA tax tab was another statement which was processed before (via Document processing). If you update the initial range, then you will also see the etax statement on eTax tab, alongside with this IRA Tax statement.

*5498esa* -> Same reason as 5098.

Hi Fahad,

Thank you for update.

I will change date range and verify eTax statement, I started already and I see tax forms after changing date.

I will need new index file for 1099oid to verify tax forms.

Thank you,

Hi Phoebe, I verified all forms and they all good, I am waiting for new index file for 1099iod to complete the story.

Only 1099iod tax form is not tested.

Thank you,

comment: [~nprimak] Thank you! 

[~Igor.Khosid] [~fahad] Is it possible for us to initiate the parallel test for 1099-INT in the meantime so we can move forward? I need to start parallel testing if possible based on what has been QA'd. 

[~Ricky Lopez] Can you assist to create a parallel test form for this? STAR: eTax Setup (1099-INT): Electronic Only.

(It will be similar to the eHSA parallel test that you assisted with previously).

I also have the same data file. We are having issue with this data file can you request another data file from the client for 1099-OID only?


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~fahad] That is the only production data file from STAR, as the 1099OID is very small. They will not be able to create a new one until next production year (if any 1099-OID accounts get generated in production, as it is not as common. I will inform them that we will need to proceed without it for production. Can you submit the IS checklist so we can run the parallel?

comment: Hi [~phoebe.george], [~nprimak], [~Igor.Khosid],
I found the error causing 1099-OID to not able to post. I resolved it.
here's the new e-index file for 1099-OID :*etax_1099oid_12312021_31_12312021_060215_star.txt*

So I'm putting this ticket to QA request again. Please have a look and let me know if it is alright.


[~phoebe.george], I don't think we would need to block the OID anymore. We just need a confirmation from [~nprimak]about it.

We parallel tested two forms, although the release is for all of them. I will finish parallel testing the remaining forms next week, but the 1099INT and 1098 are priority for posting to production today if possible.

Please see Fahad's previous comment for the information for the code release.

Please advice.
Thanks.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~fahad] STAR was validating the 1098 and 1099INT in production before we moved forward with the others. There was one area they wanted to confirm, and ensure we were not suppressing any etax forms for displaying. In their regular statement setup (non-tax), they have a suppression criteria to NOT post accounts with asterisks in the address block - reference screenshot below. But for taxes, they want to display ALL accounts (no electronic suppression). Can you confirm that is in place?

 From The code I see that for both Paper and estmt, statements are getting suppressed for "*****" in address block.

!image-2022-06-15-21-57-08-234.png!
 Should we remove that?
 Thanks.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~fahad] Yes, it does need to be removed. Sorry, the SOW does reflect this criteria, but may not have been caught during QA. Please let me know timing of how quickly this can be done and released in order to reprocess the 1098 and 1099-INT files. THanks!


author: JIRAUSER10910
comment: Hi [~phoebe.george],

I've updated the code and also uploaded the code in parallel. Don't we need to do the parallel before release? I think we should check it on parallel to be sure. Let me know what you think. If we don't need to do the parallel we can proceed to release first thing in the morning tomorrow.
Thanks.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~fahad] Thanks Fahad! I'm going to have DP re-run the parallel test for the 1099-INT and compare to production. If that looks good, we can move forward with code release.
