The pilot site is ready for testing. Please adise the client to test and provide feedback/approve.



1) Email address could be updated by SSO request.

2) Email filed is disabled editing in eStatement site.

Please see below.

Per SSCU, 
Confirmed the email update field is uneditable so we are all good there. We also confirmed the updated address is successfully passed from NCR and updates the end users profile. However, during testing we did notice if the email address is updated a second time the same day, it is not updating their eStatement profile. Is that expected? 

Thanks, Barnett

comment: Hi Barnett,



No the email address update doesn't not have a limit in the same day. Could you ask the client to provide the account number and email addresses for further research?

I will ask SSCU.

I've tested the accounts and able to update email through SSO requests multiple times. Please remind the client that to use a new SSO session to update the email. It should generate a new token for each new SSO session.

SSCU confirms that a new session resolves the issue. SSCU also approves.

Thanks, Barnett
