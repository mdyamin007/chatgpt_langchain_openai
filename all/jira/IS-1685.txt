comment: Hi [~misbah.uddin@dsinnovators.com],

Is this update for 2021 tax or 2022 tax?

1098GEN_21.dfa is for last year 2021 tax ONLY. If we need to update can you please make sure your code is in new 1098GEN_22.dfa.

Wilson is working on new 1098GEN_22.dfa for upcoming 2022 tax season forms update. Please Zoom message him to add your code.

Thanks,

Tun
