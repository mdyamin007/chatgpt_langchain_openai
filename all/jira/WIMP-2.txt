title: New Project Management and Communication Tool & Bug Tracking Tool
description: As you are aware, Joe and Michael has been testing couple need tools (Slack and Jira) and are planning to use these at part of our daily communication and project planning with ISD and DSI.
This mean we will be sharing documents (design doc, flowchart, test data, etc.) and information that may contains sensitive data.
I want to make sure you are aware and approve the use of these tools before I have the team to move forward.
