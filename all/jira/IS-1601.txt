title: SNFB - [32856][pvt] Quarterly inline insert for excessive overdrafts
description: IS Dev Hour: 3 + ISD hours 2 ( export resource and test) = 5 hours

Turnover Date: 09/21/22

Sample Date: 09/23/22

Approval Date: 09/27/22

Live Date: 10/04/22



Parallel Required : yes

Programmer: Misbah



Details:

--------------

Dfa: SNFBMS11.dfa

Need to know where to put the Insert. And client supposed to provide account list. Need to know how they will provide this, is it fixed account list of recurring with the cycle.

Also need to know if this insert is for some specific months.

This is for s,f,e option.

Need to ask dt job id, provide isd index, dpvs, archival.



------------------------per Kris-----------------------------------

1. You will send a fixed account list somewhere in the middle of month as per comment 1. Which means you will not send a separate file for account list with each cycle. Let me know if this is correct.



2. When you said quarterly insert, does it mean this insert is applicable for some specific months and will it be recurring for all years? Please confirm.



3. Also, we need to know where you want to see the insert. Before check images starts or after?



-------------------------per Client--------------------------------

1. Yes, we will send one account list to be used for each cycle received from 10/1 to 10/31 to be checked against.

2. Yes, we run this same insert with a new account list at the end of each quarter. We always catch the quarter end statements and then continue for a month to catch all necessary accounts. I know we had discussed before if there was a way to make this recurring so we wouldn't need the whole process each time, but the programmers had suggested that wasn't possible. If that has changed, that would be wonderful.

3. We would like this to be before the check images.

Since the client wants this insert for successive years, would it be possible for the client to send an account list file with the cycleSNFB_DDA_<MMDDYY>.PGP in ftpbu directory. Naming can be something likesnfb_dda_insert_list_<mmddyyy>.txt, so if the file exists only then we will display the insert for the accounts included in the file. This way we don't need to do code for each year if the account list gets updated.

Let me know.

Per the client:

We don't send the SNFB_DDA_<MMDDYY>.PGP file, we only send the SNFB_SET_<MMDDYY>.PGP file. I believe the file you named is created during your processing of the file we send. Also, I do not see the folder you mention on the FTP site. These are the only ones available to us.

!image-2022-09-20-14-38-48-137.png!

So we would need to resend the list daily for the month that the inserts should be included each quarter?

The list for this run is attached to team support ticket.


author: rony
comment: Hi [~Kbittmann]

So yes if the client can send the list with the cycle when they need the insert would be a better solution to automate this. So that way we will just check if there is another file that will be an account list that exists with the cycle, if yes we will display an insert for those accounts if the list doesn't exit we will not display it. We just need to the path and naming convention of the account list .



Let me know if this looks confusing to you [~Kbittmann], then we can discuss in zoom.

So if the client will have an insert every cycle for the month of October they should send an account list with that file?


author: rony
comment: [~Kbittmann]

Oh, the client sends files daily, didn't realize that first. Ok for now let's just go with fixed account nos. So provide us the account list and we will code to display insert for those accounts only for the only month of October.



And we will automate this in any later update to automate. That means for the month of October we will look for the latest account list file clients sent so far and display insert for those accounts. So let's say, the client, sends an account list on 10/01/2023 with the cycle. Then they don't need to send the account list for the rest of the days of October, even if they send another account list with cycle say on 10/15/2023 we will use the latest account list file to display the insert. Let me know if this is clear.

But since time is short now let's go with the fixed accounts for now. So please provide us the account list.

Missing check image tiff is ok. That's because we don't have check images in our local machine. So this is not a coding bug.

comment: [~gthillaivel] this is insert by account list. Your screenshot does not show the account number can you verify if this statement in the insert by account?


author: gthillaivel
comment: [[~Peter.Dang] The statement I captured does not have the inline insert. QA needs to check the inline insert in the print sample to see how its printed (vertically or horizontally and top or in the middle of the page).
So we need the print range for printing the account with the inline insert


author: peter.dang
comment: [~gthillaivel] Please check the is print txt to determine which account should received inline insert. TXT field position 59-63.



author: peter.dang
comment: [~gthillaivel] Once you locate the account that have insert, find the account from the print TXT. Load the the AFP and you should see the insert print range. 
 !screenshot-7.png|thumbnail! this way you can verify the insert is populated correctly.

comment: [~Peter.Dang]
1. I understand that the in-line insert is not flagged on the txt file position ({color:red}59-63{color}).
Please confirm!
2.  Print samples requested have incorrect print range {color:red}585-591{color} (Account doesn't have the inserts)
3. The in-line insert presented on the range from *{color:red}985 - 990{color}*

[~Kbittmann] - please request the print samples from the range *{color:red}985-990{color}*
