Looking at /home/test/keep/kycudlb.ran, he used the following file:

I've copied the data file and placed into:

The problem has been fixed the PROC DATE was changed manually , but the JOB CYC was not changed it was still 07-30 so there was the error. A screenshot is attached below of the control file with the change i have made.
