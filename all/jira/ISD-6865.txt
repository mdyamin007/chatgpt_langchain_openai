title: Hypercube - Daily Log Rotation
description: Rotation Hypercube log daily instead of by size.

comment: Hi[~Tin.Chak],

For daily log rotation from hypercube we need a package called "

winston-daily-rotate-file". Only version 1.7.1 or lower version of winston-daily-rotate-file is supported in hypercube as hypercube uses node version 0.10.40.

In this version ofwinston-daily-rotate-file no custom log file name is supported. The file name will be like "date.log".

Such as:*2022-04-18.log*,*2022-04-17.log*

**Different date format is supported though.

Will it do the work? Let me know your thoughts.

Thanks.
