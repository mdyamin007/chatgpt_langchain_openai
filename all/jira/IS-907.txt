Thanks, Barnett

comment: [~barnetts]Just fyi, this suppression list update will not work until IS-844 (xref logic update) is released as well


author: william.kong
comment: [~barnetts]: Since both this project & IS-844 project are related to suppression, align these two projects to be released by 4/11 instead?



Move this project live date from 3/29 to 4/11 and move up IS-844 project from 4/26 to 4/11?



Please advise.
