comment: Currently encountering issue where the unexpected zip file contents are identified, but the program does not terminate. May need to modify ${home_env}/master/check_files_in_zip.sh

Hi Kris, currently working on coming up with a solution to an unexpected programming issue.

Timeline will need to be adjusted once I decide on a solution to implement.

Thanks,
Sam
