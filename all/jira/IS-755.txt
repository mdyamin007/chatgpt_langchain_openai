The program is currently suppressing any account with "HOLD MAIL - UNDELIVERABLE" in the address. During testing I discovered that many hold mail accounts were not getting suppressed. The reason for this is that the data files are inconsistent. Please see below for a few examples from all files they have sent us so far. To alleviate this issue, and instead of making conditions for each possible scenario, I was wondering if you could ask EQBK if they would be ok with just suppressing by the "HOLD MAIL" verbiage. This would catch all the undeliverable accounts that were missed due to the inconsistent verbiage format.



1. HOLD MAIL--UNDELIVERABLE > They have 2 dashes here with no space

2. HOLD MAIL -UNDELIVERABLE > The dash is appended to UNDELIVERABLE

3. HOLD MAIL - UNDLEIVERABLE > UNDELIVERALE is misspelled
