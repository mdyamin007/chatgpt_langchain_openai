comment: *Hi Dawn:*For status update, we did not start this job yet. That's my fault. When I assigned to Eric, I accidentally put the status of IS-152 story to "Waiting for approval". So Eric did not recognize to work on that project.

I discussed with William this morning. Eric is busy with other projects for this month. We will need someone to work as RUSH job. We will let know when we got update.



*Hi Will*: Please let me know who should I assign to. Currently, I assign IS-152 to myself.
