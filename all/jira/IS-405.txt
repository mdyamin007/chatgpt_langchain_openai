Here is the sample from the test file. Few issues on product type 5017340001:

1. Are the "Overdue Payment" additions only to be displayed if record 4 exists or should they be displayed as 0.00 when record 4 does not exist? See second account of what I have right now, will update per clients feedback.

2. Are the message statements only to be displayed if record 4 exists or for all of this product? Currently displaying on second account without record 4, will update per client's feedback

3. The message statement under "IMPORTANT MESSAGE" is already on the current statement of this product. See under end of page 1. Do they want it to be removed from here?


author: dawnl
comment: Yamee,

Here's client's reply.

1. "Overdue Payment" additions should be displayed as 0.00 when record 4 does not exist.

2. The message statements has to be displayed for '5017340001' product even when record 4 doesn't exist.( Your samples are correct)

3. Please remove the duplicated message on the end of page 1. We want to keep only the message on page 2 under "IMPORTANT MESSAGE".



and I need you check below issues:

(Only for product type 5017340001)

   4. Please make 'Equal Housing Lender' Logo bigger.



(For all product)

   1. Please lower the text to prevent write over logo.

   2. Please add '$' if the raw data has it.

I attached excel file for convenient understaning.

comment: [~dawnl]: Please check to see if client wants to

-move the "Add additional ..." verbiage for product 5017340001)

comment: [~yameelee] /[~Peter.Dang]: This project is+way past due+10/12/2021. Please advise status and if we have an agreement from [~dawnl] that this project has a new live date. Today is code freeze date, i don't want this planned project to dragger further into our code freeze period.


author: dawnl
comment: Client's response 12/15/202:

"The Sample is okay for now, but we need more test. We are not ready to make it go-live yet."
"Thanks for the information about the freeze date.  We are taking longer than expected to making additional sample data, it is likely that it will be possible to proceed in February 2022."


author: william.kong
comment: [~dawnl]: Please advise client that we will need to put this project on hold at this time. Any additional response from today until end of code freeze may not be immediate as [~yameelee]has other project commitment she needs to completed.

We still do welcome feedback during this code freeze period so that we can assess if more addition coding work is out of scope. If so, client will need to schedule a commitment date they wish to resume so that we can plan ahead. Please plan accordingly so that we do not further delay this project further more out than February as time goes by.

comment: Yamee -there are 2 more things that need to be changed per client on 4/2. See the attachedexcel file. Also please provide samples with the test data files client uploaded in test folder. See the above note added on 3/31.




author: yameelee
comment: [~dawnl]I have placed all the samples in your secured share folder. Only the 2/14 data file has the5017340001 product type but it does not have record 4 for the delinquent table, therefore, I cannot test item# 2 on the spreadsheet.



Please request for a new test file that will have record 4 for delinquent table with the new values they mentioned on item #2.



NOTE:SHBK_LB_032522.txt does not work with program, I dont think it's for this application.


author: dawnl
comment: Yamee,

Here is the feedback from client. See the attached change request 0418.

"

Please disregard item #2 on the spreadsheet.

Item #2 seems to be adjustable by putting data in record 4 on our side.

So we only request to add the sentence of Item #1.

As you said, I also checked that there is no record 4 in the data file that I sent. I will request again soon with new data files, so please ignore the data file sent last time.

author: yameelee
comment: [~dawnl]that request was already made. Samples from 4/7 already included it. Please look at the sample for 2/14 to see the update.


author: yameelee
comment: [~dawnl]Please note we have made a few changes to since initial so the billable hours will be more than the initial 6hrs. For program hours only I have spent 9hrs total (extra 3hrs on new changes they requested).

Please correct the typo (see the attached) and provide samples from the new data file. .

"We found typo in page 2, please change 'contract' to 'contact'.

'*contact*information' is correct.

And is there any update on making samples?"


author: yameelee
comment: Here are the new samples.

FYI:

121521 cycle only has one account with delinquent. i extracted that account number to the first account so I can generate the sample for it.[^SHBK_LOC_121521.txt]

122921 cycle has 2 accounts with delinquent. 1 account is towards the end so i have to extract it to the first account to generate sample for it as well. the other should be towards middle of sample.[^SHBK_LOC_122921.pdf]


author: dawnl
comment: [~yameelee]

Please correct the typos. See attached image contract_to_contact.png. Here is client's feedback:

"We found another 'contract' typo in page 2, please change 'contract' to 'contact'. 'contactinformation' is correct.

There are two 'contract information' under Important Information.

Client needs more change. See the attachedChange Request_05192022.xlsx.

Please providethe extra hours you need. I will have client sign before making the changes.

Here is feedback from SHBK:

"We have reviewed the samples you sent us and need some changes.

Please check the attached file."


author: yameelee
comment: Hi [~dawnl], I spent 4hrs on making the new updates since initial work. With this one it will be another 1 extra hour. So 5hrs extra on the new update, this doesn't include generating new samples.

On the first update, about the logo, first page uses preprint which has the logo in the center already. I am not making update to item 1.

This is how it will look for pdfi and paper when printed.

comment: Hi[~yameelee],

Client signed the WO for the extra 5 hrs.

See the attached new data file. When the change request on 5/19/2022 is done, please create new sample with this data file.

Thanks.


author: dawnl
comment: Hi [~yameelee],

Can you provide the new sample with the data file client sent on 5/23?

Client requested a update.

"

Is there any update on new sample?

We want to get a final sample with the data sent on 5/23/2022.

Please let us know when the final sample image is ready."

comment: [~yameelee],

Please make sample of the account '734000007071'. See client's response below. I attached the data file again (rename toSHBK_LOC_122921_0603.txt).

"I Checked the sample you sent, but some sample account is missing.

Especially we need sample image of the account '734000007071'.

The sample data 'SHBK_LOC_122921.txt' that I sent on 5/23/2022 has information about the account.

Here I attached the same file that I sent on 5/23/2022. Please make sample of the account '734000007071'."

Thanks.




author: yameelee
comment: As said before, I had to extract this account from towards the end of the file to the front to show it on sample. Since they said those samples were approved and the new update didn't have anything to do with it, I didn't think they want that account as sample. Also since it's the same data file without changes we don't really need it to be uploaded so many times with different dates.



Here is the new sample with the mentioned account as first account. -->[^SHBK_LOC_122921_0603.pdf]

comment: [~yameelee],

Client approved the sample and requested to go live on 6/21/2022. See client's response below.

"Sample checking is done.

We want go-live from next Tuesday, June 21st, 2022.

It is expected that actual billing sending will be on June 27th.

We are planning to check billings on that day.

So please let us know whether you can go-live on June 21st, 2022."
