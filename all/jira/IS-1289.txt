comment: [~nischala.manjunath] From our call previously, here is the information for using the PFCU 'CIF' file as a xref file for Escrow Analysis posting.

The test CIF has been saved to the following location below.

File name = pfcu_cif_07052022_escrow_test.txt

Location = ac-secure-share (\\ca-isshare-01.infoimageinc.com)\is\nischalaM

XREF FILE INFO:

Field 4 = Member Number (to be used for posting in conjunction with the Appl Code/Account Type)

Field 5 = Appl Code ('Application' Code as referenced by CU)

APPL Codes will translate to the following InfoIMAGE account types for posting:

Appl Code 45 = 'LC' Account Type

Appl Code 50 = 'ML' Account Type

Appl Code 51 = 'LN' Account Type



[~Ricky Lopez] FYI

comment: [~phoebe.george] [~Ricky Lopez] - eStatement index file, ea1_20220302_1_20220909_1527_pfcu.txt is posted to pilot. 
Can you please advise on how to handle accounts that aren't present in the xref file? I've attached a list of the same.  [^pfcu_accounts_missing_in xref.txt] 
Is there a default app code I can use for these? Also, I noticed that the pdfs contain the application code next to the account number on the statement, is this always the same as the ones in the xref and can I use this in case an account is missing in the xref file?

comment: Hi [~nischala.manjunath]

-Did the additional CIF file not process due to the file name being the same as a file that already processed that day. Should we try re-naming it? Would you possibly be able to process it in production manually?-
