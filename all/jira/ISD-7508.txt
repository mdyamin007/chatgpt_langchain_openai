comment: hi [~Ricky Lopez],

Do we need to setup return mail report for this? Or just enabling the return mail feature so client could check it on infotrac?


author: JIRAUSER11400
comment: [~eric.yan]Both  we need to FTP the weekly report and also enable InfoTrac for Return Mail tab/report.

Should be in SOW

MVCU is on secure3, no need to update job-track in gitlab.

comment: Hi [~Ricky Lopez],

1) Does the report needs to be encrypted? SOW says no encryption but the file name has .pgp suffix.

2)Are you able to enable access to Return Mail through User Roles?

3) I think a sample report is not available since all returned mail has a piece code generated by USPS, which is not available in test env. I'll confirm this later.

comment: Hi [~eric.yan]
1. No encryption, I will need to update SOW.
2. This should be good to go.

I've enabled return mail for MVCU. Please work with client and determine which role should be given access of "return mail".

[~Ricky Lopez], you could grant access to "Return Mail" in the role setting.
