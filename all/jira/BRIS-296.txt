title: Staging Prism connection to Wrapper service
description: Hi Network,

I am trying to test the wrapper service but I did a telnet on port 80 and 443 toVM (ca-wrapper-dv-01) 10.5.16.52 from theVM (ca-prism-st-01)10.5.16.191 and get a connection refused. Can you open port 80 and 443 between the two machines?
