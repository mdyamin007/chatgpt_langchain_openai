title: 17739 - GCBK - API Setup for Mobile with BankingOn
description: 3/1 - Provide Auth Info document
3/10 - Enable API endpoints
3/31 - Finish all other development necessary

---

It is important to work closely with BankingOn to ensure that the way they are using the API do not conflict with SSO and the Auth file. See action#29 in the TS ticket. There are still things to discuss and work out.
---

Development:
 # Enable API for GCBK with the BankingOn API vendor
 # Update SSO7 Servlet to have a combine CIF option, and switch GCBK to use this option. So, instead of storing the subuser ID in the vendor_user_id, combine it with the CIF to make primaryCIF|subuserCIF. Still insert the subuserCIF into the vendor_user_id field anyway (This is so that we would not have to update the Admin Site).
 # One-time migration for subuser to update their CIF to the primaryCIF|subuserCIF format.



Other development may be necessary dependent certain factor/questions that are not answered yet.

UserProfileDTO already has support for a "status" field. Need to pass that into the DAO in the update user function. If the status is null, do nothing.

Define static variables for "new", "inactive", "active", and store them in a set. If the status is not null, compare against the set of valid statuses before updating "sess_active_status" to the provided status. Otherwise, fail API call due to invalid value provided.
