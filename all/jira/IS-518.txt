comment: [~lemoy28]: Please refer to the attached tiff (CLCUWLA_Page_01 to CLCUWLA_Page_04). Apparently AC did not read explicitly in the IS assessment details to include it to the Jira Ticket.

Dawn,

Sample was attached to ticket 23177, comment 38 since it is too large to attach here.


author: dawnl
comment: Le - sample sent to client for approval.


author: dawnl
comment: Le - The sample is not approved.  Here is the feedback from client.  But the sample client edit can't be attached in jira.  Please see it in TeamSupport #23177 comment #41.

"
Please see comments on page 1 and page 71 (the new member account agreement was not replaced).
Again the PDF we sent were for pages 4-24 were all corrected. Thank you!

comment: [~lemoy28]: Thanks for working on the initial part of this project. Since the scope of work has changed to also update more inline inserts, I'm going to re-assign this project to Tanmay to assess:



[~tanmay]: Pleaser refer to the attachment for the 300dpi TIFF resources "CLCU_Page_01.zip". Page 1 to 4 is already updated by Le (see exported project for his resources "/t/mahbuburT/CLCUWL001.zip"). You just need to update the Page 7 to 21 from the tiff attachment file "CLCU_Page_01.zip"). The TIFF needs to be converted to PSEG and scaled down so that it does not cover the page margins.



In addition, in the cover letter, they want to move the "Privacy Policy" bullet point+below+ "Fee Schedule"

Per my email this evening, please help me quote the hours and timeframe to get this project completed for early November. We will need to run parallel to test print the output and quality of the inserts.

comment: Hi,

Sample kept in client pickup as file size more than 10 mb so can not be attached at jira.

Thanks

author: dawnl
comment: Najoa,  does CLCU has access to this folder /d/infoftps3/Vend_DSI/client_pickup/print_process/clcuwla ?   We need to send the sample to client for approval.  The approval date is 11/9/2021.  We are not able to access the sample.   Please make the sample available to client, or AC, or IS.  Thanks.


author: dawnl
comment: Hi Tanmay/Najoa,

The rate and fee schedules are still the old version.  Please update them.
Here is the feedback from client:
"
This is unfortunately incorrect. While the member account agreement has been correctly updated, the updated rate and fee schedules are still the old version. So pages 4-7 need to be corrected. I'm again attaching the revised PDF here. Please update and resend for our approval. 
"
Revised PDF attached.

Thanks,
Dawn

comment: Hi [~dawnl], I copied (clcuwla1054.2o1.pdf) to your secure share. After review, please request DP to copy to CLCU client pickup folder.

CLCU client pickup folder: (/d/infoftps4/clcu/client_pickup/)



Hi [~Najoa] *This kind of small update, we don't need to provide entire 2o1 file. Next time, please extract 10-20 affective accounts to sample PDF and attached to Jira Story.*



Hi [~rony]: Please inform everyone for this, since AC do not have access to your client pickup folder right now.



Thanks,

Tun
