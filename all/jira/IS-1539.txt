comment: Hi [~Bryanl]- Updated PDF sample has been attached here. We have generated the sample using the February cycle data. Since the data file was so big that's why we generated a small pdf. This sample includes the accountwhose screenshot the client referred to in comment #16 of TS#31346.

Please review the sample. Thanks!

Per client:

Is there a way to provide additional accounts for processing by infoimage to assist with validation as there are only two here. Also, in the event we find this is not the fix, what level of effort is it to roll back?

We can provide a bigger sample. But it requires time to review. CU may need to wait 1 or 2 days for the next sample.

By the way, what do they mean by "this is not the fix"? We explained the whole scenario with examples in the teamsupport before signing the work order. And the latest sample reflects what they are asking for.

And yes, we can roll back if CU want.

Thanks
