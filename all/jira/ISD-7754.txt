title: WASH - [32785][pvt] Delete an account
description: We have a customer that was set up incorrectly on our side and was not caught until the customer tried to open their statement (same thing as last week with the 'D' & 'L'). Can that account be deleted in Info Trac and we re-build it on our side?

The account number is 8953586237.

comment: Hi QA,

This is updating the conf file and enable the account purging function and delete one of the account per client's request.



All conf files updated in lower env.
