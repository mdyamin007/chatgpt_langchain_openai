comment: Hi [~lina], client approved! Per Catherine of HTBK: "I have reviewed this in the Pilot Site and everything looks good!"

Please forward to QA for final check. Do you think we can go live next Wednesday, 11/10?

Thanks

comment: Hi Daphne,

Is the client aware that enrollment files should be named similar to "htbk_enrollment_20211028.txt"?  If not, please let them know.

Filename format: [cid]_enrollment_[created_date].[extention]

The following are all valid names.

htbk_enrollment_20211028.txt
htbk_enrollment_20211028.txt.zip (zipped)
htbk_enrollment_20211028.txt.pgp (encrypted)
htbk_enrollment_20211028.txt.zip.pgp (zipped, then encrypted)

Regards.
Lin

comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid],

I have ran the attached paperless enrollment file on staging for HTBK.  Some are existing accounts and some lines are missing email addresses.

The expected behavior is as follows:
1. If Delivery Preference is E and email is missing, do not process the line.
2. If the account is new, create the account and set delivery preference + notification preferences.
3. If the account is existing, set delivery preference + notification preferences.

According to my research:
New Accounts:
101994847
101997841
101998120
101998138
101998146
101998253
101999558
102000669
102000677
102001443

Existing Accounts:
101992966
101994558
101997502
101997510
102000627

Preferences Not Updated(missing email):
101999467

Can you please confirm whether paperless enrollment is performing as expected?  If you have any questions/concerns, please reach out to me.

Thanks.
Lin

comment: Hi [~dyuen],

Please let the client know that InfoIMAGE received htbk_enrollment_20211118.txt this morning. The file name format is correct.

However, there is an issue with the file format. It was "Little-endian UTF-16 Unicode text, with CRLF line terminators". The correct format is "ASCII text, with CRLF line terminators".

Thanks.
Lin

comment: Thanks [~lina], the above was added to the ticket for HTBK.


author: JIRAUSER10914
comment: Verified that client has addressed the file format issue.
Verified that the last two file that were processed cover everything in the first two files that did not process.

Notified AC to make client aware of the correct enrollment file name.

comment: HTBK is now sending correctly formatted enrollment files with correct file names.
