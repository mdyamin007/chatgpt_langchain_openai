The Count file contains the statement filenames and the count of statements that should be in the file.

- Provide processed statement count generated for each of the statement files.
email the DPVS back with the count of each data file (like the daily letters break-down).
- Test data :/d/ftpbu/idcu-testbu/STMT/IDCU_STMT_053121.7Z.gpg
