title: BKPL:  Processing Logic Improvements/Fix (IN-HSE)
description: Hi Rony and Sakib,



I would like the following corrected in light of the processing issues that we encountered over the weekend specifically with BankPlus



#1. Update /$d_dir/file_share/ logic:

Please update logic to have a subdirectory:

$d_dir/file_share/bkpl/ms2/

Program will need to delete the contents of this directory before file is placed here.





#2. Update logic to incorporate iconv -c -t UTF-8 $input_data_file > $output_xml_utf_datafile

Please insert this iconv utility command after the /home/util/rmhex00.pl

After this program runs, you will need to use the utf-8 version of the file (ie. $output_xml_utf_datafile)

The iconv will set the UTF-8 encoding of the given input data file.



After this program runs, I would like us to view the following two accounts to make sure the address looks ok. Here were the two screenshots with the errors:



Line: 35833435

Here is the foreign character issue:  !image-2021-10-07-18-22-24-062.png!



2^nd^ data issue. See below. Im fixing the data again.

Line: 93700792:



If output is ok, then please share the results for us to review as well too. We would like to see if the foreign character appears correctly in the afp output.

The original data file that from client will be located in:

/z/ftpbu/JHABU/bkpl/stmt/AIP706INFSTM20211001060758.XML.PGP_10012021_070516



The manipulated statement file that we removed foreign character is located in:

/z/ftpbu/JHABU/bkpl/stmt/AIP706INFSTM20211001060758.XML.PGP.fixed



#3. Update the bkpl_image.control file to use /home/keep/maillist/bkplms2_mail.lis instead of /home/keep/maillist/bkplms1_mail.lis; Not sure why we use ms1 for the mail list when the program is setup to use ms2. This will confuse our team if we do not keep the jid consistent. Also change /bkplms1_cksum.log to /bkplms2_cksum.log to be consistent.





#4. Please change backup directory from /d/download/$cid/ to /d/download/$cid/dda & also updated the /home/procs/bkplms2.procs to reflect this new location:
