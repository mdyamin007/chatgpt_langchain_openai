title: USPS Scan - Operation Code Update (Analysis)
description: 1.	There are three operations codes that do not have the leading 0 and that could result in diminished tracking information.  
Operations codes missing the leading zero:  
	040
	039
	044

2.	There are some Piece Mail types that could be deleted from our codes, if thats a benefit to you in any way.  

Column L Piece Mail Types that could be deleted:  
	International
	Priority
	Parcels
	Periodicals
	Sack Sorting
	PARS Processing (Might want to leave in place just in case something develops with this item)

comment: Hi David, Here I am attaching the operation code that we are using on *production*. But there is another csv which is provided through uspsscanservice application and It contains much more operation codes compared to production . Furthermore, operation codes that are mentioned in this ticket, are not available in the production. Can you please cross check the operation code so that we can determine whether we have to add some codes into production or not.

comment: Golam,

I don't understand why we have two. What is the different between the two, are those used for different service or functionality? I received one from you in early June with over 386 records. Isn't that is what we use in production?
