title: APCU - Infotrac Reporting spike
description: Can someone look into the paperless enrollment report on infotrac and explain how the graph is being generated?

Client is reporting an unusual spike in graph that doesn't match with what they see when they're pulling the CSV files



Client:

"Each month we pull the numbers of how many members have signed up for eStatements each month and we pull the the CSV file. The CSV file seems to be reasonable at a little over a thousand, but the graph below is way out of whack listing 26,486 people signed up. That clearly cant be right. Is this due to the purge in any way?"

comment: Hi Joe,

Me and Mehedi have checked the site and compared with the CSV. The CSV report is exactly same as what it shows in the UI. It also matches with the DB as well. Our finding is customer might have misunderstood the CSV download option. Otherwise there might be issue with the Database data.

Is it possible to get the CSV that they have downloaded.
