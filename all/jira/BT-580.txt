We have updated the standard print module for Daily to add endorsement typeTEMP-RETURN SERVICE REQUESTED.

And shifted it left to fit in window for both left and right placement within envelope. And this update has been taken place all tray for both simplex and duplex

This one also resolved the issue https://jira.infoimageinc.com/browse/BT-596



So updated project has been placed at/d/iss/qa/Standard Print Module/2DSDDAILYN.zip
