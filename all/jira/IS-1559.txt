Can I get a DT_JOB_ID for both Pilot and Staging with the piece code added? What account list can I use for testing?

Please confirm steps 3-6 from Jira description are good to go.

Is there an account list I can use to create the samples?

What is the weight of the insert?


author: jun
comment: [~kdishroon],

Do we have an account list to use for samples/testing? If not, can I push this for QA?
