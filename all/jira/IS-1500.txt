Jun, client responded to samples:

It looks like the XML is not correct in these. DocName and Type need to be the name of the tax form.

1098, 1099-C, 1099-INT, 1099-MISC. Currently these are all set to:

*<DocName>MEMBER TAX STATEMENTS</DocName>*

*<Cabinet>STATEMENTS</Cabinet>*

*<Type>MEMBER TAX STATEMENTS</Type>*

Please replace MEMBER TAX STATEMENTS with the tax form name.

This should match what we did at the beginning of this year.

Jun, client responded to the samples:

We were able to process each of the test files in our DEV environment.

Please proceed with the full production of these files.


author: dyuen
comment: [~jun], per description, there is no parallel. Please confirm once the code has been released to production. Once released, do I have DP process the old tax files in production for updated archival files?

Thanks

comment: Rechecked the samples--no issues, good to go.

I only ran the 2017 file "RWCU_TAX_011218_1100_PROD.asc" for archival. I can copy all the zips from this file. DP will need to run the other years. Please let me know if it's okay to copy to 2017 zips to RWCU client pickup.

Code is released to production.


author: dyuen
comment: [~jun], thanks. I'll check with RWCU. Once confirmed, I'll assign the ticket to you to transfer over 2017, then have DP run the 2018 and 2019 files.

Thanks
