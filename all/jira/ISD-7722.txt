comment: Double checked zip generation process.


The sample PDFs are generated by sending a zip file, e.g.pfcu_ms1_12012022_12022022.zip to the Print team.
 # Testing was done with "Test MM Process" for PFCU on the PILOT environment.
 # Checked InfoTRAC logs to see if there are any errors. Saw none.
 # Checked actual zip file on Pilot found in /mnt/INPUT/I3/MsgSample/pfcu/txt/. The images inside the zip file are correct. Therefore, it seems like the issue is on the print side when handling the zip file.


In "production", as in when actual statements are being produced, a similar file is generated. The print team call an API: [http://pui-pilot.infoimageinc.com/MsgServlet22?cid=pfcu&apptype=ms1&cycledate=12012022&services=print.]
 # This zip file is stored in /mnt/INPUT/I3/IS/pfcu. Again, the images inside are correct, pointing to it being an issue with the print script.
