title: BKPL - Monthly Statement Setup
description: None


author: william.kong
comment: [~mahbubS]/[~rony]: This is for the Monthly Statement implementation project. Diego will also be the BA for this project as well. Data file will not arrive until Aug 16 and go live date is September. As discussed, please work on the skeleton bare bone scripting:



e.g.:

cid is bkpl

jid is ds1



Create shell script and prepare blank DFA. This setup will be very similar to PLBK, but the print image/xml wrap around might be slightly different. Thx!

It should be "C:\ISIS\TIF\" only.

Please release the code to production.

[^bkplms2_mail.lis][^IS_PROGRAM_TRANSFER_FORM-1.doc]

Maillist and transfer form is attached. Please place the maillist file in production.

I tried to do cvs checkin but got it get stuck. So i had to manually copy the files from/d/is/cvs/check_in/mahbubS/ to/d/is/cvs/xfer/mahbubS/

This project don't have message manager so no message setting needed in production infotrac site.

Please add prefix in paperless.list of production.

Thanks


author: mahbubs
comment: Peter,

FYI,/d/is/cvs/xfer/mahbubS/ directory also has PFCUMS1 related resources because those files also need to be in production today.





Thanks


author: mahbubs
