title: MFCU [26915] [pvt] Monthly Statement Selective Inserts Permanent Solution
description: Request from client:
 Per regulations we need to once a year provide our members information about BOD elections. We do it in February month end because it gives our members enough time. We notify members in two ways: 1) for members who get printed statements we include an insert (the topic of this discussion) and 2) for members who get eStatements we will be modifying our eNotification email for February to have a link to our website for more information.



Note: Print selective inserting only.

IS Assessement:
 * Update program to pickup selective insert file if exist in zip data file.
 ** Filename: mfcu_insert_list_mmddyy_seg#.txt
 * copy list to working dir (use this list one time).
 * Update DFA to parse the list and assign to account insert bin 2.

comment: Hi [~andreav]

can you update the "insert bin assignment" section of SOW for this update?


author: andreav
comment: Yes, will do!



author: tohiduli
comment: Hi [~andreav]

is it possible to provide a sample*mfcu_BOD_insert_<mmddyyyy>.txt* file for testing?


author: andreav
comment: We received one in error in production this morn but I am checking if DP still has it and if so, you can use that one.


author: andreav
comment: DP has placed it here: /d/infoftps3/dsi/client_pickup/test
done - mfcu_BOD_Insert_03312022_1.txt

Do I need to add the seg# to the file name in the SOW?


author: tohiduli
comment: Hi [~andreav]

yes. please add the seg# to the file naming pattern in the SOW


author: andreav
comment: Done


author: andreav
comment: Pending client approval of estimate.

author: tohiduli
comment: Hi [~andreav]

any feedback on sample?


author: andreav
comment: Samples have not been provided because client has not yet signed the estimate.


author: andreav
comment: Hi Tohid, just to confirm, this update can be used for any inserts that have the same requirements correct? If so, I have informed the client to use a more generic name on the account list file like:  mfcu_insert_list_mmddyy_seg#.txt

Will this work?

This came up because the client has another insert coming at end of May that has the same requirements as the  BOD inserts.


author: tohiduli
comment: Hi [~William.Kong]

if we read the account number list frommfcu_insert_list_mmddyy_seg.txt file and update the insert_code(set second field to 1) of paper index file will it work for other inserts as well other than BOD inserts?


author: william.kong
comment: [~tohidulI]: Can you work with [~rony]on our normal process on handling permanent inserts? If I read the specifications correctly, client is asking for a permanent insert base on reading the insert list. If that the case, [~andreav]& PC department to define which bin number is the Permanent Insert so that we can update the code to assign that bin number.  That is my overall understanding of the process but would need a consult with Peter and Tun if Rony does not know our standard process as well.

If [~rony]is unsure, then we will need to discuss with [~Peter.Dang]& [~TunA]how do we logically handle permanent insert logic this logic as I do not want to mislead you.



Thanks!

comment: Hi [~andreav]

is client asking for permanent insert based on the mfcu_insert_list_mmddyy_seg.txt file?


author: andreav
comment: This is not a permanent insert. Client will have physical inserts occasionally and they want us to automatically use the insert account list to pull the selective inserts into those accounts for mailing. Client wants this automated because they cannot provide us the account lists ahead of time.

Client approved the estimate, please start work and provide timeline. This must go live for July 1st production.


author: andreav
comment: [~tohidulI] - Please update the insert file name to the agreed: mfcu_insert_list_mmddyy_seg#.txt . Please run it again for paper ONLY. These inserts are not to be posted on eStatements. I will ask PC to rename the insert to remove "eSelective".


author: andreav
comment: New Proposed Timeline:
Sample Date: 05/12
Sample Approval Date: 05/16
QA: 5/17
Parallel: 5/18 - 5/24
Go live date : 05/25

Please let me know if any concerns with the timeline.

comment: Tohid, did you see my comment in ticket 26915? Please advise. 
PC, Tohid - InfoTRAC Pilot still shows "eSelective" in the insert name. How can we fix this so it displays "TEST INSERT ONLY - Selective"?

author: andreav
comment: Client is testing what we used currently but will be providing a complete test file end of next week for us to run and post to pilot. 


author: andreav
comment: Hi Tohid, can you please put the test insert file in Daphne's secure share folder? Client wants to use it to validate before signing off.


author: dyuen
comment: [~tohidulI], please see Andrea's comment above and confirm when ready. Thanks


author: tohiduli
comment: Hi [~dyuen]

File is in secure folder. File Name: mfcu_insert_list_033122_1.txt


author: dyuen
comment: Insert file provided to MFCU. Pending approval/response.


author: dyuen
comment: [~tohidulI], can you provide a new timeline? The timeline in Jira is out of date.

[~William.Kong]FYI.




author: dyuen
comment: [~tohidulI], please see feedback from MFCU:

"I have the list. Here is an example acct #12118887 is not in the list. How can I prove in InfoTRAC (pilot) for that job run that this account did get a statement but did not get an insert? This is really the only thing left to verify here."

Is there a quick/efficient way for MFCU to verify this? It doesn't make sense and is time consuming for MFCU (or any client in general) to try and search/verify this in InfoTRAC

comment: [~tohidulI], any updates?

[~Tin.Chak], please see previous comment and advise if you can.


author: tohiduli
comment: Hi [~dyuen]

can you discuss this issue with [~Peter.Dang]?


author: dyuen
comment: [~tohidulI], per MFCU:

"Is that list in account number order? The issue is I would have to look through that whole list and I can't just use the search function. Hope that make sense.

Let's see if we can make this easy. Account #12118887should not have the insert. Can you confirm they did not get one in this run. If you can confirm that then you have my signoff."

Can you confirm that this account did not get an insert for this cycle/sample?

Thanks


author: dyuen
comment: [~tohidulI], can you provide a list of accounts that got an insert and a list of accounts that did not get an insert ASAP?

Thanks


author: tohiduli
comment: Hi [~dyuen]

I cannot verify posting from the index file on Stage ms1_20220531_1_20220614_0100_mfcu.txt]

Please advise, Im getting an error: !posting error.GIF!


author: dyuen
comment: [~tohidulI], is this code in parallel? Meaning if MFCU sent us another test file to mimic a production cycle will the selective inserting show up? See ticket #29696 for reference, where they will be sending us a test file and they want to do both a selective inserting and selective message manager test.

Thanks


author: rony
comment: Hi [~dyuen]

Yes, this code is in parallel.


author: dyuen
comment: [~rony], apologies I meant Pilot. Client would like to test some files in Pilot and want this to be available.


author: rony
comment: Hi [~dyuen]

Yes, the code is in pilot too.



[~tohidulI]



Thanks

author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~rony] [~dyuen] If we're adding selective inserts, then we also need to add a flag for that on ISD's end. I added it in on pilot, but even after reposting ms1_20220531_1_20220614_0100_mfcu.txt I am seeing errors. Rony, can you check if the index file is linked to the insert properly on pilot?


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~dyuen] per scrum since there's no e-selective, I've removed the flag from pilot and we shouldn't need to make any further updates on ISD's end.


author: rony
comment: Hi [~dyuen]

Would you please ask Dp to reprocess in pilot ?



Thanks
