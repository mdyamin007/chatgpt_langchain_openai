title: SEFC [31008] [pvt]  eNotice and eStatement Agreement and Disclosure Updates [Fast Track]
description: Per Shun:

disclosure updates will require a hypercube server restart, so by our new SOP we need to have our updates pilot approved and moved onto stage at least a week before releasing to production.

Hours: 2

Tentative turnover: 7/27

Pilot: 8/1

Approval/Stage: 8/3

Live: 8/10

I have deployed on pilot.



I updatedSEFCU _eStatement Agreement and Disclosure_ & _eNotice Agreement and Disclosure_ same as[^SEFCU eStatement Agreement and Disclosure_082022 Final.pdf]&[^SEFCU eNotice Agreement and Disclosure_082022 Final.pdf]

Disclosure verbiage user will see two times:
 * When a user go through enrollment then user will see Agreement and Disclosure verbiage.
 * After logged in a user, from the Disclosure menu tab user will see Agreement and Disclosure verbiage.

comment: HI [~sahossain], to confirm, these only appear for users that are enrolling; users already enrolled will NOT see these disclosures, correct?

Thanks

comment: Hi [~dyuen],
Actually, Not only for enrolling time. They will see enrolling time and also when users already enrolled then they will see it from the disclosure menu.


author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~sahossain], thank you for confirming.

SEFCU members will see it in two places:
 # During the enrollment process (for new users)
 # The Disclosure menu tab (for users already enrolled)

I have deployed on stage.



I providing an account for stage login.

For the first-time login you will go through the enrollment steps. After that, if you login again then you will not see enrollment steps again. So you can access for one account.



Thanks!

Thank you, [~sahossain]
Works as expected
"For the first-time login user will go through the enrollment steps. After that, if user login again then he will not see enrollment steps again and access account."
