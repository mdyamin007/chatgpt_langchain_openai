title: PFCU - [31245][pvt] Account Summary is not displaying a negative sign for negative balances
description: IS Assessment:
 Hour: 2h
 Turnover : 09/05
 Sample  : 09/08
 Approval : 09/12

Live   : 09/15

Parallel : No

IS Developer: Rony
 No ISD



Details:

-----------------

prefix: pfcums1

Changes are only in summary section

Currently in Balance column the amounts are showing always positive disregarding in data file those amounts have negative value at the end. Per client they wants negative sign if balance is negative and the negative sign can be before dollar sign.

Careful with the total calculation, since previously all balance amounts are taken as positive value the total was not right.

Use latest production cycle.

Client's request:

We would like to go with a negative sign to be consistent with the account detail instead of placing the value in parenthesis like I originally requested. The negative sign can be placed prior to the dollar sign in the summary page. For example: -$4.23

Some other things we want to ensure are addressed as well:
 * Summaries with grouped accounts will need to be reviewed to make sure they are calculating correctly (tough to find an example of this, but can confirm that logic exists to handle it correctly)
 * Summaries with grouped accounts will need to be reviewed to make sure they are displaying correctly, if the resulting account type total is negative (again tough to test)
 * The Total line should correctly include negative balances in the calculation. We found examples where the total was incorrect. See attached screenshots

Here is the feedback from client:

"I apologize for the delay. We discovered two issues with the Overdraft LOC account for David Harman in the sample you provided. The summary page is now displaying a negative sign (as it should), however the negative sign was placed after the dollar sign. Whereas, the other account types have the negative sign before the dollar sign.

Secondly, on that same account the previous and ending balance is not displaying a negative sign. The account summary and transaction history should have the same ending balance. In this particular case, there was no transaction history so the starting balance was also negative. "

comment: Hi [~gthillaivel],

ForDavid R Harman account:

1) Negative sign is displayed before the dollar sign.

2) The previous and ending balance is displaying a negative sign.
