title: IDCU -[21757] [pvt] Updates needed to Escrow Analysis Statement [fast track]
description: Turnover to IS: 9/17/2021

Sample to client: 10/6/2021

Client approval: 10/8/2021

QA: 10/11/2021

Parallel test: 10/13/2021

Live: 10/15/2021

Update IDCUEA11.dfa

Based on the new data format from IDCU_EA_STMT_072321.7z,

-new month: pos 1-2

-new year: pos 4-7
 -new to escrow amount: pos 8-24
 -new from escrow amount: pos 27-46
 -new description: pos 50-71
 -new balance should be 81-90

2 hours programming.

Additional update below:

Estimate would be 4 programming hours.

Program will skip and bypass generating the statement for print/e archival/estatement when a account data is missing the dollar values for "new principal and interest" and "new escrow.

Generate a report and send to client. (need client email contact).

We will treat this as a new change request since we would not have to time launch before 9/15 live date.

Once QA is done and we proceed with client approval, please also confirm with the client whether the following phenomenon is desired:

Is the 'Mortgage Payment' section correct given what is provided in the data file IDCU_EA_STMT_072321.stm? Please see attached photos for clarity. This potential error is unrelated to the changes made in this ticket, so additional programming/changes in their provided data file would need to be done if what is shown is undesirable.

Per IDCU:

This loan will be paid off before the new escrow amount takes effect. This is one you InfoImage would suppress from processing.


author: JIRAUSER10906
comment: [~Kbittmann]

Currently, we do not have that suppression as part of our programming logic, so we have been manually pulling these accounts from production after printing so that they are not sent.

If the client would like to have these accounts (in which the loan will be paid off prior to any new escrow charges) suppressed from processing, we would need a billable programming update since the changes made in this ticket are unrelated.

Can you provide the sample[^idcuea1123.sam.pdf]for client approval?

Thanks!


author: billr
comment: Customer approved the updated sample[idcuea1123_new.sam.pdf|https://app.na3.teamsupport.com/dc/1/attachments/10681530]. They are asking if this can be completed the week of October 12.


author: JIRAUSER10906
comment: [~billr]

Thanks for the update. Yes, this can be completed by the week of October 12.

Could you please have the client provide us with the e-mail address for where they would like the report of suppressed accounts to be sent?

Thanks!


author: billr
comment: Thanks Sam, I have asked the customer for the email address.


author: billr
comment: Sam, customer responded:

Can the list of suppressed accounts be uploaded to Client Pickup? Where the report contains account numbers, we would prefer that it not be emailed.


author: JIRAUSER10906
comment: [~billr]

Yes, as requested we will place the report of suppressed accounts (encrypted) to the FTP client pickup. We will also send an e-mail notification stating that the report is available for retrieval to the same mailing list used for pdf archival and the invalid address report.

Also, is the following file name convention okay for the suppressed accounts report? _idcu___[app]_suppressed_accts_rpt_<mmddyyyy>__<seg#>.txt.pgp_

Thanks!


author: billr
comment: Sam - I am following up with the customer.


author: billr
comment: Sam,

Customer responded:

Yes, this naming convention is good. We will begin setting up our automation to pull in this file.

comment: On ticket 21757 comment# 29 customer asked to push this to week of Oct 12:

We need to push back the production live date on this, as we have pushed our DNA upgrade to October 17. Can InfoImage plan to place the updated code in your production system the week of October 12?


author: JIRAUSER10906
comment: [~billr]

Yes, that will work!

This update to suppress customer accounts from print, estmt, and archival (for cases in which account in data file does not have all payment information specified, indicating that the loan will be paid off and no payment is needed). In addition, the original update to the escrow projections section of the outputted document (to accommodate formatting changes in the data file) is complete. Please review.
 * Exported project files to shared drive: /d/iss/qa/IDCU/IDCUEA11.zip
 * DPVS [^idcuea1115_dpvs.pdf], IS/QA form [^idcu_is-296_checklist.pdf], and 4.2o1 print file (in PDF)[^idcuea11154.2o1_small.pdf]are all attached to this Jira ticket
 * IDCUEA11.dfa has been updated to suppress the accounts in question, generating a report of all suppressed accounts, along with the original task of accommodating format changes in the data file
 * idcuea_process.sh has been updated to take the suppressed accounts report generated during the format step, encrypt it, place it in client pickup, and send an e-mail notification

Please note that I have manually modified IDCU_CrossRef_07232021.txt for testing purposes as the original one that the client provided is missing account numbers, preventing our program from processing all accounts in the data file. I have packaged this file into IDCU_EA_STMT_091521.7z.gpg for processing/testing.

Attached is a list of account numbers missing from the cross reference file that I have manually inserted. The client does not need to send a new one, but I thought it'd be good to make note of.

Could you have the client review the following?

I have placed a sample of the encrypted suppressed accounts report _idcu_ea1_suppressed_accts_rpt_09152021_1.txt.gpg_ in the client pickup folder:_/d/infoftps3/IDCU/client_pickup/test_

This is to confirm that they can open the encrypted report and that the format of the data inside is okay. Note that 2 of the account numbers in the report were manually suppressed for testing purposes.

I am following up with the customer.

As client has approved and is able to retrieve/open the encrypted suppressed accounts report, can we move this to parallel testing?

Here are the IS programmer details to process this job in parallel:

Processing procedure: /home/test/procs/idcuea1.procs
Input file location and name: /z/ftpbu/idcubu/ea/IDCU_EA_STMT_091521.7z.gpg
Cycle #15
Special instructions: /home/test/master/idcuea_process.sh 1 bypass

Just to confirm, QA does not need to see print samples because of the nature of the changes made in this ticket, correct?


author: igor.khosid
comment: [~gthillaivel] [~SamV2021]

Sam, QA completed - means we are done with testing and do not need any additional information. Unless it was further development after QA completed testing

Gnana - please confirm

We can pass the print samples for this change. Can you update the IS checklist

Hi Kris, what's the status of this job? We haven't moved this to parallel testing yet right?

Parallel ticket 23178 created.


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~SamV2021] [~Kbittmann] I was just assigned parallel TS 23189. Does this update affect estatements as well?


author: JIRAUSER10906
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima]

I believe so. Changes were made to the positions in which information from the data file were extracted, so an update should be seen on estatement as well. Also, some accounts will be suppressed from print, estatement, and archival.
