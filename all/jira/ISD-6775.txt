comment: Hi [~Tin.Chak], Hours need to be assigned during PR stage. I can not go back to the client and ask for more hours.

I need to reject this ticket. I'm not sure why it never went to ISD for analysis, but there's a new account type added in the eStatement index file that we don't know about. We have to review on our side what we need to do to support it and what feature it might affect.

comment: [~MattL] I think there's a bit of misunderstanding. On our call last friday, I wanted to clarify whether a new account type was indeed necessary, and so we confirmed that. However in order to add a new account type, it involves making multiple updates on our end so we need to assess the work/hours needed as usual before we can start.
[~Tin.Chak] Fyi
