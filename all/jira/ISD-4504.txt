title: 19737 - ACBK - Wrong name displayed in emails
description: Account name is updated through the statement index files. Go onto the production PUI server and go to this path: */d/INPUT/I3/process-files-backup/acbk/202105*

In that above path, grep for the account name to confirm if it is still being passed in.

comment: this ticket is resolved and updated in Team Support. The reason was the bank gave us the wrong data in the index file.

comment: Emails actually take username rather than acct name, user's old name was still coming in the auth file.
