comment: [~MattL]: In light of resource issues, we just literally had to re-assign this project from Le to Ruman (a new DSi Software Engineer that recently joined us). 

Unfortunately this means we cannot make the original 8/20/2021 sample due date. I'm hoping either Monday or Tuesday we can get some updated samples.





[~rumanb]: As discussed via email, please don't hesitate to raise any questions. Please also confirm sample date if you cannot make it by Monday, August 23, 2021.



[~rony]/[~anwarh]: Please ensure to oversee Ruman on this project.



Thanks!

comment: Hi [~MattL]

We will provide sample tomorrow. Just to make sure, we need to replace the current e-statement/archival backer, right? For paper the backer is coming from pre-print right?



Thanks

comment: Hi [~MattL]

This is updated sample with added backer.

Was there any feedback from Tye about index file posting? We are getting closer to the due date.

I already provided it to qa and qa is getting error from index posting.

comment: I haven't heard anything from [~tye.wu@infoimageinc.com] . I've escalated to [~tai.trinh]

comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid]

would you put this tiff file[^WHCUB3-1.TIF] in tif folder inside isis folder then open the project again to see if this works? We haven't faced this issue before strangely.

Let me know.

Btw, I asked for new dt_jod_id from pc. After I reran the process and after isd team post our index file and backer, I will let you know . You can resume testing afterwards.

So so sorry for the inonvenience.

Thanks,

Rony

I changed the parallel id:20210826104554.

Due to the two seperate delays on our end can you please advise if this still needs to go through Parallel?

author: william.kong
comment: [~MattL]: I spoke with [~rony]via Skype this morning. He will reach out to [~TunA]to release the changes made by [~rumanb]today in preparation for EOM processing.



I'm also checking [~rony]to see if we can provide a print range of the afp file to print and ensure the quality looks ok. No parallel is required for this job.



[~rony]/[~rumanb]: Please advise if we can provide a print range of any afp file for OPS to test print to make sure output looks sharp.




author: william.kong
comment: [~MattL]: [~rony]corrected me. This changes request is for eStatement only. No print necessary and no parallel needed.
