title: FLCU - [23318][pvt][in-house] In-House Request to fix Statement error
description: This is about Interest Charged overflow error for ISIS version 6.



William comment in TS #23039:

"Please re-assign ticket to AC to create an in-house ticket for this issue as we would like to implement a permanent fix for next month should this issue occur again."



I tried adjust print position for interest charged lines, but the error cannot go away. I don't know if you have other idea. When you have time, please try to adjust it.



If it doesn't work, please discuss with William for how to proceed. We may either update to ISIS version 7 or get help from ISIS.



You can test as follow:
 - I attached project.

 - Update/home/test/isis/docdef/FLCUMS11_TEST.dfa

 - Run /home/master/pr_test.sh in rh2 ( for parallel env)

 - Run following command straight for formatting:

I need a new timeline for this update. Would you please work with Thomas to provide?

comment: [~thomasY]: Let's shoot for 2/28/2022 but still try to get this done earlier since we delayed this project.

[~thomasY] - please attach IS checklist


author: william.kong
comment: [~thomasY]: Please run this in parallel. I would like to see the results of the DPVS and compare it with the original production DPVS to see if there is a lot of page differences. I would expected that number accounts to be the same, but the number images may be a few images less with this enhancement.

I would suggest using version 7.19 instead of 7.14 if you have time to switch it. If not, we can keep 7.14.

comment: [~jharvey]& [~Igor.Khosid]: We need to delay this project once more. [~thomasY]did additional testing yesterday and added more records to the data file, but it actually didn't fix the issue. He is needing re-review and fix this issue again.



We most likely may not make it for this 2/28/2022 date. I will check in with him tomorrow again on the progress.

Made a small additional update that should completely resolve the issue for any number of transactions.
