comment: [~TunA] - Can you please pull the samples and put them in my KeriY share folder?


author: tuna
comment: HI [~kdishroon]: I copied samples to your secure share folder ( /Keri Y/tfcu/).

(From/d/infoftps3/Vend_DSI/client_pickup/print_process/TFCU/Logo_Update/)



Hi [~tohidulI]: If the update is just for logo or cosmetic update, you don't need to provide large sample files for each notices. Next time, please provide only 10 or 20 accounts for each. You can zip up and attached to the Story.

comment: Hi [~tohidulI] - The client is asking for samples without client data; are you able to provide templates? They indicated that{color:#1f497d} some of the logo on the samples were blurred so they want to see the template before approval.{color}


author: tohiduli
comment: Hi [~kdishroon]

Sample without client data attached.

author: william.kong
comment: [~kdishroon]: Thank's for the update! Live date of 12/31 will not be met. Please alert me and [~tohidulI]and we will see when we are free to resume this project in possibly in Jan or in Feb.

Please see the client's feedback below; is this something you can change? Let me know if you need something from them.

author: william.kong
comment: [~kdishroon]: Any status update on the logos? This project is past due. Can we set the new live date expectations for next Wed?


author: kdishroon
comment: Still pending client approval of recent samples; live date updated. Will revise once we have approval.


author: kdishroon
comment: Hi [~tohidulI],

The client is saying the logo images from 12/31 look distorted; can they be improved at all?


author: tohiduli
comment: Hi [~kdishroon]

Attached pdf samples for tfcu loans (tfcume21, tfcume51 and tfcume61) with returned address logo with same size as one as coupon. (previously the return address logo was 1mm and 3mm shorter than the logo used in coupon section in width and height)

[^tfcu_loanbills_sample.zip] [^tfcu_loanbills_sample.zip]


author: kdishroon
comment: Hi [~tohidulI]

These samples don't appear to be clearer; if you zoom in on the logo, it looks wavy or jagged (see examples I circled below). Do I need to ask the client for better logo image?

comment: Hi [~Andrey.Kutsenko]

can you check the samples given in the zip file in the 6th comment? The sample have the same return address as the exported projects.

the zip file was[^tfcu_sample_with_dummy_data.zip]

And for the tfcume21 project can you set the environment variable "JOB_SEL" to "e". The project has pre-print so that's why it will not show the logo under "JOB_SEL" "s" option.



I re-exported the TFCUDLA1.zip to the QA folder(/d/iss/qa/TFCU/).


author: tohiduli
comment: Hi [~kdishroon]

can you provide the approved sample of these projects to QA?

tfcume2(heloc), tfcums2(monthly business), tfcums1(monthly regular), tfcumv2(visa), tfculc1(loan coupon), tfcume5(solar loan) tfcume6(consumer loan), and the daily letters (TFCUDLB, TFCUDLD, TFCUDLE, TFCUDLH, TFCUDLG, TFCUDLL, TFCULO, TFCUDLP, TFCUDLQ, TFCUDLR, TFCUDLT)
