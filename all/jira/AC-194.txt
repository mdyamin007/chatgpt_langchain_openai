title: CHCU - [21966][pvt] CHCU / SECU Deconversion Full eStatement archive transfered to hard drive
description: Base on the number of document that we are expecting to process, I estimated that we need around 5TB in order store all the PDF documents.

CHCU can sent us the first 2TB Hard Drive. As we process, we will have a better idea on how much more storage we need so that CHCU can then purchase the second one.

500KB x 10,000,000 documents



Here are the estimate and time for generating all these documents. Please create the JEF with the work order once this is approved.



Quote: 80 hours (creating the program and processing)

Estimated Time for completion: 90 days

Resource Availability to Start: 9/13/2021



We will produce PDF documents from December 2013 to December 2021.

PDF will be compress into a zip file.

Additional Index file will be include in each zip file that contains the following information.

1. One month of data for testing. Please upload to FTP. How quickly can we get this?
