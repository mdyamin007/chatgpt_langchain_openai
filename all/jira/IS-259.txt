comment: [~anwarh]: Please advise when this project is supposed to go live? I think October 4, 2021 right? If you are not sure, please let [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]or I know. Right now this ticket is past-due.


author: anwarh
comment: [~William.Kong], this statement was also tied to color update.
 But it's complete now. I was hoping to get the afp2web issue resolved. I could then ask for e-statement approval for all 6 app.

[~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com], Can I have the new live date and QA date for this? Will this be going live with the rest of the SURU apps?

Anwar - wondering if the new resources provided to ISD?
Shun - are completed with ISD 5056 and, if provided, uploaded the new resources?


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~Igor.Khosid], I was actually pending further action from stephen on my ISD ticket.

[~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] [~anwarh] I saw an email chain sent today with the subject "Request to Upload Resources for SURU Statements" which Tye responded to, are those resources for this project? If so can we start including at least the jira ticket number in the email subject so that it is easier for ISD to figure out who is assigned to it on our team? 

Also if it is related, I'll work with Tye on uploading these.




author: anwarh
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima], yes, that one was related to this one (surums6). In the future who should I request in jira? In email, I usually sent it to [isd@infoimageinc.com.|mailto:isd@infoimageinc.com.]


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~anwarh] I think either on jira or email is fine for now, I believe we still might be figuring out what's best. However if it is over email, please include the ticket number in the subject line so that it is clear to ISD on who should be working on it. 

Also I've let Tye know that this project is assigned to me, so I'll actually be taking care of uploading these resources. Per my most recent email though, can you confirm if we should be updating these files?

author: anwarh
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima], can you please check the above comment?




author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~anwarh] There is this error in the logs:

java.lang.Exception: infoTrac_flag is on but dt_job_id is missing from dataTrac(IS) database

Can you double check that the dt_job_id exists? For some reason it's not getting passed over to us. 


author: anwarh
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima]: that index file was missing in the `ESTMT_DT` table, not sure why. I re-ran the process again, new index file showed up correctly. Thanks.



[~berezinez]: Can you please try to post with this new index file?

Could you please request the print samples?


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid]

I had samples printed on Monday. They should still be in the IS inbox. See my email. Mike V printed them.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~anwarh]- can you please provide a DPVS for print samples for a statement other than a .hvy? The DPVS provided previously only had .hvy and QA needs to review non-heavies.

Anwar, why we need to use customized module?

6) 2DSD2IND_SURUMS6.dfa
7) 2DSD2IND_SURUMS6.prj


author: anwarh
comment: Hi[~Igor.Khosid],

If we use the standard "2DSD2IND" print module, this happens

!image-2021-10-14-03-31-28-825.png|width=267,height=342!

because we are printing the address at the bottom, the standard module can't handle this on the heavy cover page.
 That's why we need a new custom module to handle this unusual scenario.
