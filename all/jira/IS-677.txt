author: berezinez
comment: [~dyuen]

Can you check SOW if there is pdf archival? and attach pdf archival specification?


author: dyuen
comment: [~zhuoxinT]and [~berezinez], sorry! I just double checked the SOW. This application does NOT have PDF archival. Update is only for print and e. Thanks

There is no backer on the print samples. and no endorsement type - it should be there? can you attach SOW?

Please request print samples with a backer for both letters.

comment: [~berezinez] [~zhuoxinT], Masterparallel #25074 created.


author: william.kong
comment: [~dyuen]: Due date is set for Jan 1, 2022 which is a Saturday. If parallel passes by EOD today or before 11am noon, we can release the code on Thursday 12pm. I will assume that client will not send files on Friday.



Please advise if this schedule is ok, granted that parallel passes before 11am tomorrow since it is half day. If parallel is late, then the code release will need to be some time later on January 3 when the team returns to work.



Please advise at your earliest convenience so that we can set the expectation for [~zhuoxinT]and [~yameelee]to work on the code release schedule.


author: dyuen
comment: [~William.Kong] [~zhuoxinT] [~yameelee], schedule agreed. I will keep an eye on the parallel and communicate when parallel completes.

Thanks


author: william.kong
comment: [~dyuen]: As discussed. We will go with the offer to go live by Jan 3, 2022 to see if we can tackle all the parallel issues identified by ops. The recent issue identified OPS was not part of the original scope of work so we will need to see if has to be corrected. Once OPS confirms it is ok, then we can schedule the release for Monday, Jan 3, 2022.


author: dyuen
comment: [~William.Kong], client has been notified of Jan 3rd live date. Please keep me notified if this changes. Thanks


author: william.kong
comment: [~zhuoxinT]: For the issue that OPS reported in the parallel that is not part of the scope of you project, can you see if the following will help address the issue:



Tina suggested a fix that Ernest suggested last time this incident occurred from a different TS #21120. Maybe that will address the grey issue OPS reported from the Print.

[~yameelee]: FYI in case there are questions on this.
