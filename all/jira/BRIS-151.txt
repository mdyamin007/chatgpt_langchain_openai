title: RHSTORE:  NFS port access request for ISD Server
description: [~premraj.patil]: Surekha needed to request additional servers to be added to our ca-rhstore-pr-01 server. ISD's server needs access to ca-rhstore-pr-01 as well:

The two+addtional+ servers are:

ca-elk-pr-01

ca-elk-pr-02

[~surekha.dani]: I've exported nfs access on ca-rhstore-pr-01. After Prem opens up the ports above, you should be able to mount to ca-rhstore-pr-01:/d/isd_share/
