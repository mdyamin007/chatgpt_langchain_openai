comment: Hi [~thomasY],

Is there a way we can get this live sooner? UTCU released the code on their end early and can't undo it. Please advise.

Thanks, Barnett

comment: Hi [~thomasY]

I just wanted to double check, is it "COMMERCIAL VEHICLE" or "Commercial Loan" that is supposed to be on the header?

The client's request was:

The word "equipment" that is showing up as a loan header should be Commercial Loan. That change was made prior to the 09152021 EOM STMT extract that we sent over.

Thanks!


author: thomasy
comment: [~Bryanl]Header information all comes from data. It is displayed as is.


author: william.kong
comment: [~Bryanl]: Just a courtesy reminder. Approval Date is due today in order to meet the 10/21/2021 live date.


author: thomasy
comment: [~barnetts]Attached new samples with the minor code change as mentioned in Ticket#23309[^utcums2_1019.pdf]

Client approved of samples this morning for Ticket #21196, can this still go live tomorrow 10/21?


author: thomasy
comment: [~Bryanl]This still needs to go through QA. The job does cycle monthly so I think there is still time.

I spoke with Thomas and client has approved samples for 21196 and also for 23309 but needs to check one thing with their legal team. When client confirms, then we can release code, thanks!


author: william.kong
comment: [~Bryanl]: Please advise client that we have no later than Friday, October 29, 2021 to release code. I'd prefer not to release any code next week during EOM. In the meantime, I will update a tentative date of 10/29/2021 (Friday). Anything after this date may need to wait until next Wednesday 11/3 or later to release.



[~thomasY]: FYI.

author: william.kong
comment: [~Bryanl]: I will tentatively mark 11/3 as a code release date and also change the status for "Watiting for client feedback" to agree on the live date since this project is approved.

comment: [~William.Kong] [~thomasY]

Client has received full approval, should I tell client this can go live 11/3 or later in the week? Thank you!
