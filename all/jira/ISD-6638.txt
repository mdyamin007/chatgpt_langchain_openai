comment: [~Azad] [~Tin.Chak] When you return to office, STAR approved the pilot site. However, they had some questions on the description that we pass in the API tied to what Alkami is displaying. They don't to hold this up to move forward with our eTax setup, but would like to confirm below. Here is the full feedback from STAR, with their questions noted below:





*QUESTION ON API DOCUMENT DESCRIPTION:* 



[@Phoebe George|mailto:Phoebe.George@infoimageinc.com]  Im working with Alkami to understand how they are displaying the document description. Below Ive attached information Ive been provided from Alkami. It appears they are using the *stmtType* value to display the document description, when I believe they should be using the *docDesc* value. Unless you think differently, I feel as though InfoIMAGE is passing the data as expected, and I should push Alkami to leverage the *docDesc* value to provide the best and most accurate description. If you agree, then Im likely going to sign off on you all posting the tax docs electronically and Ill work on the Alkami side to better handle the data you all are passing. In the end, the document is showing, its just not the description I prefer (Ive attached a screenshot below of the customers side in Alkami  Youll see that the Fair Market IRA docs do have a better description, but Im assuming thats because youre passing a more detailed description in *stmtType* due to that being one of the custom tax forms you did for us.).



Heres the info from Alkami:



_It looks like the name Tax Document is pulled based on the infoimage response back under stmtType: "etax" - Our code reviews the stmtType response to determine the description name that Andrew is talking about._

__

_Based on this unless infoImage changes the stmtType name from "etax" to something different (example "1099r") it will fall under the name on our end as "Tax Document" Otherwise this would require a code change on our end to use docDesc which im not sure how viable that is from a product perspective._

{color:#172b4d}I would like to get Alkami and InfoIMAGE on a call this month to talk through the best overall changes that need made to display the document description correctly. Theres seems to be a bit of a disconnect, so Im hoping having all parties on the phone will help us solve the tax document gap as well as prepare appropriately for the notices that will start getting loaded. If you can send me times that your technical teams would be available over the course of the next few weeks, I can see what times Alkami would be available.{color}

comment: Hi [~phoebe.george]

The*stmtType* key is used to determine the_type_ of an Statement throughout the application. Replacing the value "etax" with another string for stmtType key will be impractical. In think, it will be better to change the logic on Alkami end to display the *docDesc* value instead of stmtType.

[~Tin.Chak]Let me know your thought about this.

Thanks

comment: [~phoebe.george] Azhar is correct. Alkami should leverage docDesc for the specific tax form name. stmtType is a group of statement type that it falls under. We can't put the detailed description in stmtType as it will go against our data model.

comment: [~Tin.Chak] [~Azad] Sorry again that I missed informing you that the pilot site was approved! Please proceed with preparing for staging and let me know target date to complete. Thank you!

I can finish configuring the stage environment tomorrow. Then I will pass the ticket to QA for testing.

[~Tin.Chak]FYI.

Thanks


author: azad
comment: To QA,

Stage environment is updated to run eTax job for STAR. Index file can be found from the IS ticket IS-932.

Run the job in Test mode and by bypassing the dt_job_id search.

Thanks.

Project is released to Production.

Thanks

comment: [~Azad] [~Shun.Kuwashima] We completed code release for STAR etax. However, when DP processed the production files for 1099MISC and 5498 specifically, the 'eStatement AOLP' was not displaying.

Can you confirm if this was enabled? The other applications posted okay.

I added Shun because we just talked about this in the Tax meeting. But now that I look back, I did not specifically request AOLP to be enabled. Can you confirm? Thanks!

comment: Hi [~phoebe.george], apparently estatement online proofing was not enabled on infotrac, I just enabled it now. Can you check again?
