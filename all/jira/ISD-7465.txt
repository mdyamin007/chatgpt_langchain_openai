comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid],

Can we set aside a QA personnel for this next week?

We're planning to release this on Thursday.



This is to test GCBK Email Optout Feature on stage.

Here are the steps to QA:

All with the same account that's signed up for electronic statements and email notification preference.
 # Send an email to yourself for monthly statements and receive it.
 # On Stage Admin Site, unsubscribe from email for that account for monthly statements.
 # Send out an email to yourself for monthly statements and don't receive the email.
 # Send out an email to yourself for loan statements and don't receive the email.

Thanks!

comment: [~Ethan.Yu] we can't guarantee next week = based on the agreement with ISD for a release to happen, it must be QA'd a week in advance

comment: Hey [~Igor.Khosid],

You can contact [~Tin.Chak] about how to QA this.

For the most part however, it'll just be doing the exact same QA that Andrey did last time around. We just removed logic regarding a conf file flag and after removing it. We want the logic to be the same as earlier.
