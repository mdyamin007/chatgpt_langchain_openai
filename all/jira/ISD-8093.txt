title: EWBB - [34206][pvt][in-house] Duplicate statement June 2022
description: There are 980 other accounts that have a duplicate 9/30 statement (technically 981 since I hid the stmt from yesterday rather than removed just in case). I checked that the accts with the cripple flag in ms1_20220930_1_20221001_2210_ewbb.txt are the same as the ones with the replace flag in ms1_20221003_1_20221004_0536_ewbb.txt. There is one account 1043927 that we may need to handle manually, but I think the rest can be put in a list and ran on the PUI to pull them.

comment: [~MattL], This is complete. I've removed the duplicate 9/30 statements from cycle 175844-C30.01-V20353. 

Internal Note for reference: PUI job 3541646 shows 988 because 4 accts had two cripple stmts in ms1_20220930_1_20221001_2210_ewbb.txt and logs showed each of those accts twice, so it added 8 more than it should have. Only 980 were pulled as expected, while 1 acct was removed manually due to only having 1/2 cripple stmts in the index file.

comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima]client is also wondering what is causing this to occur. can you please advise?

comment: [~MattL] The process was not properly capturing the cripple/replace logic, so as a result the replacement pdf was getting added rather than replaced. Per Sean's comments on 34206, a fix was made by dsi on 10/27 so going forward it should not happen for future cycles.
