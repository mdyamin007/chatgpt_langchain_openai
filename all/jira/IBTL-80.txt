comment: [~hkhosravani]: /z/isd_input/I3/process-files/msbk folder does not exist. I don't think ISD synced the folder structure. But regardless, should our eStatement job_sel=f create missing "cid" folders under $d_dir/isd_input/I3/$cid/ if it does not exist.



If not, i would like to talk with Peter and Terrence to get this enhanced globally so that we do not face this same challenge when we setup+new+++ clients. (In this case, a brand new system environment). Please temporarily create the /z/isd_input/I3/msbk folder in this situation and retest.



Please update me on what your findings and solution is so that I can come back to this reported issue and review your assessment. (i.e. re-assign this ticket back to me if you testing results are good or bad again).



Thanks!

comment: [~hkhosravani]: I will close this ticket out. I've also asked David to sync the dev data over so that we have a snapshot of the data for testing. There is 15TB of data so he needs a few days to transfer the files over.
