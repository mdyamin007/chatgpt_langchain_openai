Just a note per our last conversation about this application. The data file and any other additional files to complete this has yet to be provided.

After checking the smartsheet it seems that the start date has been updated to 10/19 and a live date of 11/28.

Can you provide the test file name? I don't see anything with the naming convention "COLU_adverse_..."

comment: Hi [~Natalie.Tom]-Were you able to locate? Thank you

I found the file "colu_decline_092922_1.zip.pgp", but according to the SOW the file name should be:COLU_adverse_<mmddyy>_<seg#>.pdf.pgp.

Please confirm the SOW file naming convention as the test file comes as a .zip.pgp and the SOW mentions a .pdf.pgp


author: JIRAUSER11400
comment: [~Natalie.Tom]-I will update SOW to read colu_decline_mmddyy_seq.zip.pgp

Please update the SOW with updated information to add this new application to the etaboard. In the current SOW, the information is pointed to a different COLU application.
