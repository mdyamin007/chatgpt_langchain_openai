THEN suppress TRANSACTION from statement

Note from CU: In general, we want Tran Code 745 from both Record S and Record W to print to the statement.

While we do have multiple scenarios where we are suppressing the transaction from the statement, we are looking to suppress Tran Code 745 from printing to the statement if it's in Record S and the DISB-PROC-DATE (S,1006-1011) is either 05/02/22,*07/01/22*or 07/02/22. The other two scenarios in which want to suppress Tran 745 from the statement apply to both Record S and Record W (when REC-CORP-ADV-REASON-CODE (S/W,0194-0197) is NULL; when NET-DISB (S/W, 0016-0021) and TOTAL-RECD (S/W, 038-0043) are both zero).
