We need to have those files in ETaxData3 file format to post as etax.

Thanks!

As ys1 and ys2 will be processed via doc as separate application, the doc file format is correct.

Please ignore my previous comment.

Thanks.

ys2(HSA) is posted in pilot.

Also, ys1(IRA) has wrong date format (MMddyy). Doc supports yyyyMMdd format. Please update.

Thanks,

comment: [~Azad] I had to close this Jira ticket for STAR because the print portion already went live. I have re-opened a new ISD Jira ticket as we continue to work on electronic setup. The new ticket is ISD-6508. 

IS has created new index files, I'll tag you on that ticket, let me know if you can post these to pilot. Thank you!
