comment: [~jasramos]: At the time the servers were back up, some of the directories were not mounted. Normally Network runs a system_check.sh to detect and autocorrect this issue, but I have asked them not to do so for the duration of the brisbane move project. Otherwise it will recover and start the crond inadvertently causing the brisbane system to process job erronoeously in production.





Directories are restored. Thanks!
