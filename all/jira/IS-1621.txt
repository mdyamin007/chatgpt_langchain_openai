- Setup eSelective inserts for sefcml3 (Mortgage Statement - Home Equity)
- ** Note: Following statement is recommended by Shun in TS 33055 comment#6. IS can only setup eSelective Insert. Not guarantee that will work after eSelective Insert setup.
"This allows the index file formatting for piece codes to be consistent with ml5,
which would prevent posting issues."
- Selective insert by account list or selective by program must already exist
- Summary for eSelective insert setup
1. define "eStmtSelInsFlag" in control file (eStmtSelInsFlag="TRUE" in sefcml3.control)
