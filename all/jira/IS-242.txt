comment: [~rony] can you let me know status of this, as I saw the other application had QA in progress already. Thanks!

comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid]

There is no coding update at all so no parallel id. This is same as other issue where we worked for fcbt daily. I just needed to run it to see if e.sup entry appears in dpvs.

You can check the dpvs:

/z/plba/plbaml1230.print

/z/cafc/cafcml1230.print

to see e.sup entry.

Other cid will also work.



Thanks,

Rony

comment: [~rony]& [~Peter.Dang]: I don't think Peter saw this comment from last month? I just check /home/keep/paperless/paperless.lis and I don't see it updated. I also noticed that I don't see the /home/insert/agalml1.ins file in production. I don't want to prematurely add it without discussing.



Also this ticket is outdated, so what is the expectation for the live date of this project. I'm going to call [~Peter.Dang]now to see if he knows or if we need to speak with [~phoebe.george]. Thanks!

comment: hi all, i actually thought this was already live using the paperless for all applications, as I have already sent this for billing/invoicing. Please confirm what needs to be done for this specific ticket ASAP and I can re-open the Jira epic if needed. thanks

Please advise.

Please see my comment from 10/13/21, my question was not addressed or confirmed.

I need confirmation for each of the applications if paperless is NOT being used. I checked a couple of associations (PLBA and CAFC) and see eSUPP accounts on their DPVSs. Is the paperless update done for some LIQ files and not others?

Are some programmers waiting for confirmation to move forward, while others have released? Let me know what you need from me to either enable this or confirmation that it is enabled.

I can update the live date, but I'm not sure what is pending from me other than confirmation to move forward if the paperless is not being used. Let me know what the new live date will be and I'll update it.

comment: [~Peter.Dang]: Please advise the status of this project. Not sure if all the paperless file settings were updated. Please advise on Friday when you return to office.

Looks like this was never released which that we have NOT been suppressing their statements in they are enrolled electronically with the exception of fcba; However, fcba is using an old paperless file since 10/4/2021. The following screen show NO results in our paperless.list file.

{{ grep -irH 'agalml1\|agfcml1\|agnmml1\|agtxml1\|alfcml1\|cafcml1\|ctfcml1\|fcbaml1\|fcbtml1\|hlbkml1\|lacaml1\|lalbml1\|lsacml1\|milbml1\|plbaml1\|sagcml1\|txfcml1' /home/keep/paperless/paperless.list}}

!image-2021-12-09-12-54-21-227.png!



Also, do ALL applications require an insert file so that DP can define the paperless file to use for eSuppression? I on;y see some applications:

{{ls -ltr /home/insert | grep -irH 'agalml1\|agfcml1\|agnmml1\|agtxml1\|alfcml1\|cafcml1\|ctfcml1\|fcbaml1\|fcbtml1\|hlbkml1\|lacaml1\|lalbml1\|lsacml1\|milbml1\|plbaml1\|sagcml1\|txfcml1'}}

!image-2021-12-09-12-57-58-781.png!





Of all the insert files that existing, only one has esup defined, but is using OLD paperless file:

comment: [~phoebe.george]/ [~Peter.Dang]: I worked with Peter, these are the CIDs that were affected where we have not suppressed printing.



/home/keep/ctfcml1.ran

/home/keep/plbaml1.ran

/home/keep/milbml1.ran

/home/keep/alfcml1.ran



Let's discuss early next week with DP on when and how to release this.

comment: [~William.Kong] Meeting scheduled for 12/16 with the requested attendees via separate email.


author: william.kong
comment: [~phoebe.george]: Per my email earlier, can we have a short 30 min meeting with DP, [~Peter.Dang] , you and I to review this. We want to cover the issue above and plus the goal to only release certain insert files; But if we do, any data arrives for the cids that don't have insert file will fail processing and DP needs to inform IS to review to make sure output looks ok; Per [~Peter.Dang], we may have not tested those sub cids during developement.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~William.Kong] yes, based on the email you sent separately to request a meeting, I scheduled the call for Thurs, 12/16 to include you, Peter and Cesar/Neil (DP).


author: william.kong
comment: Per discussion, Phoebe would like us to activate all the applications that are missing insert files.. Cesar will assist by copying the parallel inserts to production and update the DT_JOB_ID.



Action Item for Will K. to create the missing 9 out of 13 records in the /home/keep/paperless/paperless.lis file.



i will update this ticket when done.








author: william.kong
comment: [~rony]: You can+finally+ close this ticket out. We have had our internal meeting yesterday with Phoebe and worked with DP to provide insert file and we've updated the paperless table.
