Would it be possible to include some descriptions when turning over the story to QA?
Also, the structure of the stories is not providing an epic?
Please update the due date - all three stories were turned over to QA today, 11.24.2021. All available QA resources are already assigned to other projects

comment: To QA,
 * *Show closed account verbiage on the estatement page only.*

 # Previously the closed account verbiage was shown in header space. It has been removed.
 # This verbiage will now only be shown in the estatement page and no statement will be shown by default. To show the statements for a closed account, showClosedAcctStatement flag needs to be true.
 # If the account is closed then no statement will be shown. Instead this verbiage will be shown -- This account has been closed since *last_modified_date*. In addition to that, if the client also has an acctExpiryDays flag then the verbiage will be This account has been closed since *last_modified_date*(from FIN_ACCOUNT table). You have no access to this account since *last_modified_date*+*acctExpiryDays*.

 * *Prevent batch download option for closed accounts.*

 # After clicking the batch download button, in the account number checkbox, the closed account can be selected to batch download its statements. It is prevented by hiding the checkbox if that account is closed.

*NOTE:* showClosedAcctStatement flags business is preserved i.e. if this flag is true, the closed account will behave like an active account(by showing the statements) and this accounts statements can be downloaded in batch. 



Thanks,

Azad

Verified on staging SSO WECU and BANB, changes work as expected.
