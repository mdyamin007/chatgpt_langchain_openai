title: TeamSupport Ticket #10508 - APCU
description: Jared Martin @ APCU provided the following feedback regarding job status. Can these items be looked at for a future enhancement release?



1. Job Status- Details search takes you back to page one when you use browser back button or click on.For example if you are on page 7 and you look at one cycle then try to go back to page 7 it takes you back to page one.

Client mentioned this can be frustrating when you are searching several cycles that span over man different pages.

2. Copy & Paste feature only works one time. Previously you could copy and paste several times.

3. Search function should allow search by member number.

4. Default to 50 jobs per page (or allow user to save preferences).

The user needs to use the buttons that are included. We are looking into adding a navigation tool at the top and bottom so that the user is able to use those tools provided.

Since this is an individual request at the moment we won't be moving forward with this.

3. Search function should allow search by member number.

We will be looking into this and either adding search feature to top and bottom of window. We are thinking to search by name instead. Still discussing.

4. Default to 50 jobs per page (or allow user to save preferences).

comment: Tyler, that is not what the client is saying in #1. Please re-read and attached is a screenshot of where they are talking about once they click on a specific job for the details about that job and need to go back, there is no way to go back to the page that they were on.

comment: We need to look at when they are actually in a Job and not just the job status tab itself
