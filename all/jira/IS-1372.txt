A slight problem with the data file. Although the client combined the first name, middle name, and last name as expected but starting column of all the fields after that shifted 1 column left. For example, the street starts from column 124 in the data file but it was 125 in the original code or data.

test data:

 !image-2022-08-09-15-56-43-958.png!



Previous data:

!image-2022-08-09-15-57-33-612.png!



But per the client, those fields should stay in the same position as previously.



Also in the test data in the last line, there is a number in the middle of the street and city. Not sure what is this



Please let the client know about this and send us a replacement file.



Thanks

Rony

Per SANA, 
The number in the middle of the street and city is the second line of the address. Such as apartment or unit number.

Here's an example:
SANDRA R KING 
4723 LAUJRA LANE
148
SAN ANTONIO TX 78219-1872

They are looking into the other issue about the fields being shifted.

Thanks, Barnett

The current production data file has date in 1st line.

!image-2022-08-15-17-48-50-391.png!

But the data file client provided doesn't have this. Please confirm this from client that this would be included in production data file or not?



Thanks

Please ignore my previous message, the code is actually adding the date at the top of the data file.
