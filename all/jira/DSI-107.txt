comment: Hi Abdullah,

I'm taking over this project for Tai.

Can you let me know what type of testing you did for this set up.

Also I can't seem to find the branches/pui-dev-dsi directory in the svn to find the PUI front end code. Is it possible for you to send me a screen shot of it in the svn repository exploring?



Thanks!
