We don't see quite difference between the template for original vs copy except below:

!image-2022-08-22-14-04-44-029.png|width=757,height=413!

is it right?

The data files attached in Jira , are those correct data files? Because client sent another data [https://app.na3.teamsupport.com/?TicketNumber=30737]comment 18 with name address info in data file. Please confirm?



And client should send separate data file for original and copy letters right? Please confirm.



Thanks

Would you please advise here? The data files attached here are not seemed like the correct ones. Because those have only 3 columns.

Also per my previous comment, we don't see quite a difference between copy vs original template. is it right?



Thanks

My apologies on the delay, I was OOO. Please see the newer .csv you mentioned from comment #18, I have attached it to ticket. I think InfoCARE missed moving that file onto ticket.

And yes that looks to be the only change on the templates based on what they sent us. I will upload SOW soon and pending response on if they will send separate data file for original and copy letters. Please let me know if you need an extra day regarding providing samples, thank you!

Per client:

What will be the value of "DocCode" in archival for letters "Title Reminder" and "Title Reminder Copy"?

I have asked question and still no approval, client is OOO until 9/14, thanks!

comment: Hi [~rony]

Per client:

The team has reviewed the samples and everything looks good. They also wanted to know if it would be possible to get PDF samples of the first run, so we can validate one last time.

To your other question, I'm not sure I fully understand what a DocCode is. Could you explain further so I can get this to the right team to weigh in?


author: rony
comment: 

Hi [~Bryanl],



We are working on two new letters,_"Title Reminder" and "Title Reminder Copy"._

_We noticed from other letters that for the archival option there is a field called "DocCode" and the value is unique for every letter._

_!image-2022-09-15-12-23-10-249.png!_

_Therefore the client should provide the values for the new two letters or the 'PDFArchicalSpecs.Docx' file where we can find the "DocCode" values._

_Also,__I'm not sure I fully understand what you are saying about "PDF samples of the first run"._



_Thanks._

Are those account no or member no?

The reason for asking this is the xref file has account no in the 1st column and member no in the 3rd column. So which column in the xref file should I match?

Alsoplease send us a xref file that have some match with the data file provided in Jira([^Title Reminder Sample with Name and Address Info.csv]).



Thanks.

Per client:

Update: Anngie let me know when these were originally scoped and tested prior to conversion, it was decided that the Title Reminder (Original and Copy) would be combined to one document type--2249.

If these need to be separated on your end, I'll have to let her know and we can make that change (it will have different numbers from OnBase.)

Regarding account vs member number, this has only ever been account number. The CSV shows the last four of the account number, so maybe I'm not understanding the question here.

In xref file, we have got full account number and we need to check if it matches the account number of data file. Therefore we need the data file with full account number.



Thanks.

comment: Hi [~rony]

Per client:

I spoke with our Analytics team and after we looked at this again we had a few questions:
 * On closer look, the Sample files you provided back did not contain the "Loan Number: " line below the date in the letter. Was this missing because you are waiting on a xref file, or is the template incorrect?
 * Do you need the full account number for a one-time spot check as we complete this project or all the time going forward. We don't want to provide the full account number in the mailed letter for security reasons, so we just need to make sure we understand the request more fully

Happy to jump on a call and include our Analytics team if that is easier to talk through. Just let me know and we can set something up and get this wrapped up.

comment: Hi [~Bryanl],

The data file that was provided by the client does not contain 'Loan Number'. So to add the loan number we need a data file with 'loan number'. We do not have any complaints about the template.
We need the full account number because we need to generate report by matching the account numbers with data file and xref file mentioned in the SOW. And we are doing that for all the time going forward.



Thanks.

Per our meeting with them still pending data file with full account number that we will be partially censoring. They also noted the following:

2249 is the doc code for the Title Reminder - Original/Copy


author: rony
comment: Hi [~Bryanl]

In the meeting I couldn't ans fully whey we need to xref file. Below information these are needed for archival index files are coming from xref file:

member number, delivery preference, email address, sales id



Thanks

comment: Hi [~rony]

Did you receive the data file through FTP?

Per client:

The new Title Reminder Letter files were generated this morning (10/19) with the full account number. Hopefully that resolves all the issues/questions that InfoImage have.

Anngie: Tami wasnt sure what else might be needed to get these files to InfoImage, but they are always saved to J:\Analytics\FILE_EXPORTS\IT\INFOIMAGE_TITLE_REMINDER_LETTER (They said this file explorer location was just for Anngie's reference)




author: rony
comment: Hi [~Bryanl]

Sorry, I am not sure. Is this the data file name, INFOIMAGE_TITLE_REMINDER_LETTER? In that case, I don't see it.



Thanks
