comment: [~Jessica]/[~Kbittmann]: per our scrum meeting. I recalled mentioning this needs to go through parallel to test suppression. It's past 12:30pm PST so I'm not sure if we can release it today. We will need to ask DP to hold job until parallel has past to release code before processing their cycle.

comment: [~Jessica]/[~Kbittmann]: Please advise if we are on schedule for tomorrow's live date since we are still pending parallel...
