    for initial update, you can use the production file ( last month end)
    Member number is 3173118 and the account number is 10846007. 

    The client will send a test file that includes a sample of the product being added as well as a few other accounts, just to verify the work.  It will be very small in comparison to a regular statement file and the dates won't run from the beginning of the month to the end.  I'll also send a test auth file only for the accounts contained in the statement file.
