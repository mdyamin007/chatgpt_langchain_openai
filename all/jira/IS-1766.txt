[~jharvey] Please note and let client know that the verbiage at top of coupon is bolded however it does not seem like it because we had to use a 1 size smaller font due to the verbiage not fitting if using same font size as rest of coupon[^v2_MSBK_ESCROW_COUPON.pdf]

[~jharvey]Please provide both samples to client and lets what they decide to do

Client approved the samples and would like to go with the version with the smaller size text bolded please.

Also, client would like to know if we could possibly have this live before their file runs on 11/28.
