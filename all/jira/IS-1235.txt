title: HEBC - Stmt PDFi Conversion to AFP2PDF Python [InHse]
description: Update existing processing script to no longer use PDFi tool to create pdf.
 Instead use afp2pdf.py program with index_build_multicore option for ALL statement related apps.
 The smaller daily notice jobs can use the current index_build options.

All the zip file, pgp encryption, index file contents, and PDF file naming convention must remain exactly the same original specifications.

Please ensure the standard SOP on the directory structure must be followed: 
 ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/pdf, ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/zip, ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/work is followed.
 Also, clear the folder directory folder before each processing. We do NOT want to accumulate previous runs.

The current program should support checking total PDF counts verification to make sure the expected pdf matches the total number for pdfs generated; If not, incorporate this standard verification logic

DT_JOB_ID:
 133604-C30.01-V21724

Processing Scripts to modify:
 hebcms1_process.sh

Data Files to use:
 heb_stmt_05312022_1.xml.pgp



*NOTE*: This job runs on RH2. Since we are migrating from RHS to RH2, we should test all options so that we can do afpcompare and also ensure there is no errors in the processing logs.

comment: [~anwarh]: Sorry to do this to you! But can you re-run all job_sel options again using the latest production file in parallel? Unfortunately, I do not have the original AFP file to compare in production (i.e. using afpcompare).

I've placed a copy of the production data file into:

/d/ac-secure-share/dsi_print/anwarH/hebc/is-1235/heb_stmt_07312022_1.xml.pgp

Please re-run all job_sel options again.





Thanks!

comment: Hi [~William.Kong],
I ran the script in rhs server for all job_sel options, and the archival's output (pdfs) are kept at this location: /z/dsi_pdfi_testing/hebcms1/new/pdf

Thanks,
Rakib.

I'll work on this today.

comment: [~Andrey.Kutsenko]: Please use the following:



/d/pdf_compare/hebcms1_prod

/d/pdf_compare/hebcms1_parallel



They contain cycle 2/28/2022 for PDF archival.



They cycle 7/31/2022 i asked to reprocess is for me to use AFPCompare to make sure there is no AFP file issues. I will share my AFPcompare results later today.

I'll use these pdf for comparison and run the script with the same parameters you used earlier.
{code:sh}perl pdf_compare.pl hebcms1_prod hebcms1_parallel result_hebcms1 -pixels 12 -threads 32 -maxfiles 15000 -exclusions hebcms1.json{code}
I'll publish the results after working out the script.

I looked at some diff files and as for me - everything is fine.
[~William.Kong] take a look, please >>> /d/pdf_compare/result_hebcms1/

comment: [~Andrey.Kutsenko]: Sorry for the delay! I had to work with Network Team to move the afpcompare testing server to the production environment in order for the afpcompare to use the production resources for testing.

AFPCompare testing results are complete. Now that you completed PDFCompare and my AFPCompare results are good, can you update status that QA passed so that we can schedule release next week?

comment: [~anwarh]/ Rakib: Please see email 'RE: PDFi to AFP2PDF: Code Release Request'. There was an issue in your transfer directory preventing Tun to release the code.


author: william.kong
comment: [~anwarh]/ Rakib: Please advise response above? We just need to clarify why the extra files before Tun can release code.
