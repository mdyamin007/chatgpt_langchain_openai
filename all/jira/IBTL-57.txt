title: RH2 - Parallel:  Unable to scan files for banbes1
description: I was unable to scan files on the new rh2 server; the scanner doesn't pick them up from /z/infoftp_int/banb/.

I was able to scan the files on the current rhs server and they are present in the is_parallel database but the code still errors out.

comment: [~nischala.manjunath]: Can you run this test real quickly this morning to confirm if this issue is related to the missing DataTRAC MSSQL database? If it is indeed fix, please notate in your comments and re-assign it back to me.



Thanks!

I also tried processing it by commenting out the infotrac flag in the control file to bypass this check but it errors out because of the missingDataTRAC MSSQL database.

comment: [~nischala.manjunath]: Thanks for sharing the screenshots. The SQLDeveloper screenshot is using the Menlo DataCenter database and not the Brisbane Server database.



For the brisbane parallel database, the last scan time we have is:

For the file you are looking for, can you try the following file:

test/AUTOMAILF.LN6660P051820.txt.pgp
test/AUTOMAILF.LN6890P051820.txt.pgp

You can go ahead and log into the Brisbane Jumpstation via RDP: 10.4.20.127 and use the "temporary" Brisbane Oracle Database with IP address of 10.4.24.12:

comment: [~nischala.manjunath]: Just a FYI. The FTPBU Scanner for parallel is ready to use. So when we test RH2 or any other server, we would be ready. Thanks!

comment: [~nischala.manjunath]: RH2*parallel* *environment*++ is up now. Can you please re-test in parallel and verify it works? I would like this completed by EOD Friday or earlier.  Please re-assign to me when you are done testing whether it is good or bad.



If is also good, please update the smartest to state that you completed the task:
