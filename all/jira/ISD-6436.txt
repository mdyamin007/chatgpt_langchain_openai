comment: [~rony] [~berezinez] [~dyuen] I've added letter code 038 - Address Change Notification onto stage and the description should be showing now on InfoTRAC. 

As for the logo resource S1SPCUH1.300, I found it on our servers but it is dated 4/24/19. I am also seeing the SF Police logo, which Alis mentioned is incorrect. Rony, can you provide the resource file you have on your end? I'm thinking we maybe have an outdated version and wondering if we need to replace it on ISD's end.

comment: Hi Shun,

Would you please upload this logo[^S1SPCUH1.300]. This is not actually a new logo it was used in spcudnb.

After that if you can post thedna_20220216_2_20220301_1223_spcu.txt in stage to see if logo change appears.

Thanks,

comment: Thanks [~rony], I've updated the resource.

[~berezinez] I've taken down the previous index file and posted the above dna_20220216_2_20220301_1223_spcu.txt that Rony provided. Can you check again to see if the old logo still shows?
