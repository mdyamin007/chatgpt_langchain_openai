comment: Hi [~Shun.Kuwashima],

Please see the client's response below; I am assuming we cannot do this but please confirm.

*Here is what we like to do:*

*{color:#555555}5/1 {color}{color:#FF0000}New {color}{color:#555555}customers will have the option to individually enroll and accept E-notices enrollment disclosure.{color}*

*{color:#555555}6/1 {color}{color:#FF0000}Existing estatement c{color}{color:#555555}ustomers will see a shorten acknowledgment for enrollment into E-notices.{color}*

{color:#555555}*Can InfoImage track acknowledgement to enroll into E-notices on 6/1? Can InfoImage turn on E-notices for those existing customer not enrolled in notices?*{color}

comment: Hi [~Tin.Chak], can you advise on the clients questions in Keri's comment above? This is a new enotice app setup project which initially consisted of just adding a new enotice tab and enotice letter codes/descriptions. I don't think we can support any of their additional requests, but just wanted to confirm.

comment: Hi Shun,

That's correct, the extra functionality requested can't be supported.


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: Thanks Sean.
[~kdishroon] We can't support those extra functionalities.

I have attached the signed work order for this [^[Untitled].pdf]:

- Update all user with sess_active_status as 'active' to 'pre_enroll'.

- When user with 'pre-enroll' status logs in, they will see the disclosure page. If the user agrees to the new disclosure, the status will be set to 'active' and they will not see the disclosure again. If the user choose to not agree to the disclosure, they will still be redirected to the statement page, but the disclosure will be shown to the user when they logs in again.

comment: Hi [~kdishroon], just want to clarify since it's been a while. For my portion, we want to add 22 new letters with codes 001 - 023 with exception of letter 015, can you confirm? 


author: kdishroon
comment: Hi [~Shun.Kuwashima] - Yes, that is correct.


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: Thanks [~kdishroon]. I've added the enotice codes/descriptions already onto stage, so this portion is ready for testing whenever IS and DSI is finished with their stage updates.
