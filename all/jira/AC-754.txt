title: GCBK - [30037][pvt] Savings Link Notices - Updates
description: Below is the assessment and timeline. The print image file provided by bank for the Savings Link Fee Notice was good in terms of anchors. There were no issues and the current program was able to split the statements correctly as soon as I loaded it.

*NOTES FOR DEVELOPER (PLEASE ADD TO JIRA IS STORY):*

_Letter 21_= GCBKDL021.dfa & is very easy to modify. This is a csv flat file. Just follow and make the verbiage & format changes described on the word doc for each corresponding template.

_Letter 22_= GCBKDL022.dfa & is a print image file and anchors must be tested thoroughly. There were no changes made to anchors and new file was able to load successfully into current dfa, therefore anchor testing should be successful. Change dfa logic in which the*START_BODY*variable stores the beginning part of the letter right above the transactions. Currently this is set to store 1 paragraph (old format), modifications must be made to store "Dear" greeting plus the two separate paragraphs following the greeting.
