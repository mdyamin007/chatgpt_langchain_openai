comment: [~Sheikh_Fahim] since you provided several updated files with the .TIF extension, I removed the ones with lowercase .tif. In total there are 28 TIF files and 1 pseg file. I provided all of the current resources on our servers into a folder IS-1250_current_resources, which can be found in my share folder on ac-secure-share. Can you check if all those are the correct versions? Also if there are any old zip folders that we no longer need, please remove them. Thanks

Can you do me a favor. Can you post this attached index file in stage and check whether the images are appearing or not.
