Turnover date: 03/28/22

Qa date: 03/29/22

Assessment Details:

Application : apcudlc

Need to update in APCUDL085.dfa for letter 075 template.

Set ESTMT_SUP_MAIL_CODE='z' if &LTR_CODE is 075. This will suppress eposting for this.

in apcudlc control file add this 075 to esup_ignore. This will prevent esuppression.

APCUDL085.zip is in qa folder.

[^apcudlc329.print]check this dpvs letter 075 has 15 accounts.

[^dlc_20220328_3_20220329_0507_apcu.txt] check this index file letter code 075 is not present. This means this letter is now suppressed from e-notice.



Thanks
