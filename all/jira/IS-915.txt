The test data file is not follow naming convention as the production file. Can the client provide anew test file with correct naming for parallel test?


author: dyuen
comment: [~Natalie.Tom], can you clarify how the test file name does not follow the production file name?

The test file is LN_PMINT.STM; when the file is moved into production/live, that file should be zipped inside the Daily Notice zipfile.

Thanks


author: tuna
comment: Hey [~dyuen],



The data file (LN_PMINT.STM) should be inside production zip file name: FFFC_dn_<mmddyy>_<segment>.zip.gpg.

For now, [~Natalie.Tom]can manually encrypted the file for testing. That will be nice, If the client can send new encrypted test data file for parallel test. Can you please check with client?

If not, we need to use parallel test with the same file that Natalie manually encrypted. And, please remind client to make sure the production file require to come inside the encrypted file together with other daily notice data file.



Thanks,

Tun




author: dyuen
comment: [~TunA] [~Natalie.Tom], understood. I updated the ticket asking if FFFC can send a test file as requested. For now, can you proceed with the test file we have?

Thanks


author: JIRAUSER11103
comment: [~TunA] [~dyuen] 
Yeah I will manually encrypt the current test file for testing.


author: dyuen
comment: [~Natalie.Tom], I was able to get a test file zipped the way it should come in production.
|*File Name*|*Size*|*MD5*|
|TEST/FFFC_dn_031722_01.zip.gpg|6.47 kb|392e0f156304559d9f1267247432ba58|

Let me know if you need anything else.

I noticed the new data file is missing information in the notice compared to the original test data provided. In the original test data, there's a line that has "AMNT/AMNT2/AMNT3/TXT1"above the paragraph that starts with "Your mortgage loan..". Can you confirm that the new data file doesn't have that information?


author: dyuen
comment: [~Natalie.Tom]I reached out FFFC about your concern/comment. Thanks


author: tuna
comment: Hi [~dyuen]: Per our conversation, Natalie will use previous test data data file sample. The new data file is missing "AMNT/AMNT2/AMNT3/TXT1" line.



Hi [~Natalie.Tom]: Please submit sample with previous test data file that include"AMNT/AMNT2/AMNT3/TXT1". Daphne will inform client that the line is missing.



Thanks,

Tun



Good data file screenshot with "AMNT/AMNT2/AMNT3/TXT1"

author: dyuen
comment: [~Natalie.Tom]/[~TunA], FFFC confirmed they removed that verbiage, so the most recent test file is correct. Does this affect the samples/change?

The samples - ready for the client review


author: dyuen
comment: Samples forwarded to FFFC for review/approval.


author: JIRAUSER11103
comment: [~dyuen] 
I also forgot to note that while processing, I had to update the file name fromFFFC_dn_031722_01.zip.gpg toFFFC_dn_031722_1.zip.gpg. I made the change because it wasn't processing due to the naming convention of the file. From the recent file they provided, segment is given as '01', but after checking previously provided files, the segment is usually 1 digit.


author: dyuen
comment: [~Natalie.Tom], no worries. For testing purposes, I think FFFC just named it with the extra digit, it should come in with 1 digit during production. Either way, I'll let FFFC know too. Thanks


author: dyuen
comment: [~Natalie.Tom], samples are approved!

The target live date is scheduled for 4/15, do you think we can release sooner if parallel completes before then?

[~Igor.Khosid], I submitted a request for print samples.

Masterparallel will be opened if print samples look good.




author: igor.khosid
comment: [~Natalie.Tom] - Please turn the story over to QA for the final testing.

Once parallel passes, we'll need one day to release, so potentially it could be released early.
