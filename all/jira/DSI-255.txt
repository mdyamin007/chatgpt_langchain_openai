When we open statements on Hypercube, it is opened in a new window. The window does now show the back button. We need this for when the statements have inline check links.

After opening a check link, the check is opened in the same window as the statement, so the user would have to be able to click back in order to go back. Otherwise they would have to close the window and open the statement again. The shortcut or 'Right Click' -> 'Back' would still work, but we can't expect all users to be able to know that.

To test on Pilot, SSO with WECU. CIF: 12345. Set one of the account number to:400650570.

Please research and implement a solution as soon as possible.

Thanks,

Tai

Hi [~tai.trinh],

I have found out two possible solutions to this.

Solution 1. Open the statement pdf in the same window (instead of a new one) but new tab. It will show the browser back button by default. So, the client can go back to the statement page from the check page.

Solution 2. We can show a "Go B*ack To Statement*" button on the check page. So the client can back to the statement page by click on that button. It takes some time for go back to statement pdf page. So, I put a loading gif while back to the statement page.

I think solution-1 will be better suited because it will be less coded andgive a clear look and better control. Let me know what do you think.

Hi [~sadman anik],

Thank you for the research. Let's go with the same window, new tab option. This is what is happening on InfoTRAC, so let's have the behavior be the same.

Also, fyi, you would need to use the @isd flag in order to have the comment synced to the isd ticket.

Thanks,

Tai

Hi [~sadman anik],

I was informed by Joe that he told you to do both options. That will take precedence over what I said in the previous comment.

Thanks,

Hi [~tai.trinh],

I have done with coding with both options and currently, it's on testing. Can you give me more 1 or 2 clients acct num with inline check link for testing purposes?

Thanks,
