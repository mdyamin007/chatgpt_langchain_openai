During enrollment step 4: along with email user now will be prompt to enter phone number as well(which will be an optional field).

suppose during ECL it inserted both email and phone number but the user only provided the email address(same as the ECL), what will be the expected behave then? If we let the user go through to the next step with no SMS, the next step is MFA validation I will still have the SMS in the NP table so while I fetch I will get SMS and email both. I need clarification on these scenarios.

Thanks,

Abdullah

comment: They have to match what's in the NP. This is a validation step; not a provision step. However, if the phone number value in the np is null, we will simply ignore.

I think this commit may have been lost when the SVN server failed:
 * Checking for non-existent email should happen right after Step 3 instead of after Step 4.
 * Also, the message should be "In order to sign up, you must have an email on file. Please contact us to update your contact information."
