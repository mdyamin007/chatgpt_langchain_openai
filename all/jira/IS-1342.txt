title: WFCU - [30599][pvt] Standalone Transaction Comment Issue
description: Update following format program to show dates in transaction, if 410 is follow by 439 (instead of follow by 430).
wfcums1(regular stmt), wfcums3 (Business Stmt)
Note: only found this issue on the regular monthly statement. But the business statement is similar to the regular one. So
format program for both applications will be updated.

Please see below client feedback:

I provided some screenshots (attached) to help explain the date and transaction description issue we are noticing. The second attachment is what the transactions look like on our end and what the dates should be.

Per the client:

This example looks really good! can we get the samples for the other accounts as well?


author: JIRAUSER11101
comment: [~Kbittmann]I will run the data file. Since it is a large set of data. I need couple hours on that. I will send you the samples when its done.
