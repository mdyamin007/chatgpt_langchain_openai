title: 19148 - IVBK - Setup Enrollment File
description: Due date is whenever IVBK goes live.

Setup enrollment exactly like CAMB.

One thing to clarify:
 * Where is the file going to arrive in the FTP?
 * If it is going to be dropped off in CAMB, we will need to turn on isWholesaler for camb in the scanner configs.
