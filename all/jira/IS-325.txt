Can you confirm sample date for these notices? I'll put together the final timeline once confirmed.

Thanks!

Hosein and I will have a meeting tomorrow to discuss. We'll get back to you tomorrow!

The sample date of 09/09/21 should be good!

There are a few things I'd like to confirm:
 # Multi-page accounts will be printed in simplex (as indicated in SOW).
 # Logo information should print as is (not sure if positioning needs adjustment since I am not familiar with the new 6x9 envelope, specifically where the envelope window is located).
!IVBK_logo_info.PNG|thumbnail!
 # In the Cambridge prod file, which we are referencing as it will be similar to this IVBK job, multi-page accounts (pages that are in page sequence) have the verbiage "Wire Transfer Receipt" on the top right of the first page. Single-page accounts have the verbiage "Wire Transfer of Funds Notice" on the top right of the page. Can you confirm that for this IVBK job, the first page begins with either "Wire Transfer Receipt" or "Wire Transfer of Funds Notice" and no accompanying page(s) (in page sequence) start with "Wire Transfer..."? This is important because the anchor we are using for account break is "Wire Transfer".

comment: [~SamV2021] please see updates below:
 # Correct Multi-page accounts can print simplex.
 # The logo/return address can be displayed as is, no adjustment needed. The 6x9 envelope is a custom preprinted envelope where there is a logo on the outside of the envelope. I attached a sample here for reference.
 # For the IVBK setup, it will mirror the CAMB verbiage, as they are generated from the same core data, but we had requested their vendor just to split out the IVBK information. The details you have noted are accurate as long as they mirror the CAMB setup. I will note these specific verbiages in the SOW accordingly for client sign off.

Sam, because this is an implementation project, QA usually starts after all submitted samples - approved by the client.



in addition, after client approval, the following information is needed

From Impl lead,
 Path to the updated mapping and SOW
 Attach approved samples

From Developer,
 Turn over JEF to QA in Redmine
 Parallel ID
 Index file for posting if needed
 dpvs, file ID, image range for QA samples included heavies if needed

Noted, thanks!

[~phoebe.george]

Could you please provide this local sample to client?[^IVBKDL01_sample.pdf]

Thanks!


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~SamV2021] samples are good!

Can you provide a DPVS for this, as I want to review actual print output, since it's hard to tell what the logo will look like once printed based on the PDF sample (since it was converted).

Thanks!
Phoebe

I processed today's data file (ivbk_wire_090721.pdf.pgp).

Attached is the print file in pdf format[^ivbkdna1074.2o1.pdf]along with the DPVS[^ivbkdna107_dpvs.pdf]

I believe the positioning for the addressee information will need to be adjusted (either the 2D/IMB or the address lines). Please let me know which of the two (or both) should be adjusted.

Thanks!


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~SamV2021] From the OPS test print, they need the following modification to the address block:

The address block is in the incorrect position for these samples if it is going in the 5289 envelope. These are currently at 5cm but for a 6x9 they should be at 5.5cm.

Please provide a new DPVS once updated. Thank you!


author: JIRAUSER10906
comment: [~phoebe.george]

New DPVS attached [^ivbkdna107_dpvs_new.pdf]with adjustments to address block.

Please let me know if there's anything else that needs modification.

Thanks!


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~SamV2021] thanks! forwarding to OPS now.

For outbound files, the SOW indicates that the FTP destination folder is 'IVBK/client_pickup'. Just to confirm, we should not put any outbound files in '_/d/infoftps3/camb_', and so a new account for IVBK should be created, right?


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~SamV2021] yes, you are correct, there are no 'outbound' files for IVBK PDF notice setup. We should only email a copy of the DPVS, similar to the CAMB PDF notices (using the same email addresses). I'll update the SOW to note that there are no outbound files. Thanks!


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~SamV2021] Print samples with latest address block adjustments are good; okay to move forward.

Can you send me a 'test' email notification with the DPVS attachment, similar to what is being sent for CAMB PDF notices?

Let me know when you feel this will be ready for QA, and I can pre-plan with Igor to schedule time. Thanks!


author: JIRAUSER10906
comment: [~phoebe.george]

You should have received an e-mail report containing the DPVS. Processing this job should now send a DPVS attachment to the e-mails specified in this job's mailing list -- I have copied over the e-mails used in the CAMB PDF notices.

Just to confirm, we do not need to send an invalid address report to client pickup, correct?

This should be ready for QA by Monday, September 20th!

Before handing it off to QA, I'd like to confirm which pdf file provided by the client we should use for testing. We have the camb_wire_052721_prod_file.pdf that was provided, which I have processed before, and output appears fine. Or, we could use the ivbk_wire_mmddyy.pdf files that have been provided, but those only have 1 account which is not enough for testing.

Could I get a DT_JOB_ID for stage and pilot? Assuming we use camb_wire_052721_prod_file.pdf, I will package the file up as ivbk_wire_091021.pdf.pgp. So, the cycle # would be 10 and segment # would be 1.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~SamV2021] for the testing, can we use an IVBK file - we have been receiving live files, so any cycle that you see available is good, although the file sizes are only usually 1-2 accounts. The reason we used the 'camb' file for testing previously was for mutli-page and larger volumes for testing. Only the 9/13 IVBK file had two accounts (ivbk_wire_091321), can this be used for testing? 

I'll request the DT JOB ID info for pilot and staging. Thanks!


author: JIRAUSER10906
comment: [~phoebe.george]

I do not think the _ivbk_wire_091321.pdf.pgp_ file with 2 accounts will be enough by itself for QA to test. While I have tested with the 'camb' file for multi-page, householding, etc. I believe QA will also need to see those.

What do you think[~berezinez] [~Igor.Khosid]? Would the _ivbk_wire_091321.pdf.pgp_file (2 accounts) be enough for QA to test with?


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~SamV2021] Here is the DT JOB ID info:

Staging = 132871-C01.01-V22612

Pilot = 138995-C01.01-V22689



Also, I'm okay with using the CAMB file in order to test the scenarios you mentioned.



Thank you!


author: JIRAUSER10906
comment: [~phoebe.george]

Thanks!

I'll go ahead and provide QA with print sample information from both the 'ivbk' and 'camb' test files then.

comment: QA

This new daily notice setup has been approved and is ready for QA.
 * Exported updated project files to shared drive: /d/iss/qa/IVBK/IVBKDN001.zip
 * DPVS, IS/QA form, and print files (4.2o1) are all attached
 * No index file needed as this job does not have estmt nor archival

Note that we will test with both 'ivbk' and 'camb' test files as we need the 'camb' one to test for multi-page and householding. I have packaged the 'camb' test file as _ivbk_wire_091021.pdf.pgp_

For print samples:
 * TEST ENVIRONMENT
 * DPVS (left to right):[^ivbkdna113_dpvs.pdf][^ivbkdna110_dpvs.pdf]
 * IMAGE RANGE (left to right): 1-2, 72-88
 * TRAY 1 STOCK (both): 4000

I'm wondering if this project has been approved?

please provide approved samples and request print samples.




author: JIRAUSER10906
comment: [~berezinez] [~phoebe.george]

I believe this was the final approved sample [^ivbkdna1074.2o1_new.pdf]. Pheobe, can you confirm?

Thanks!




author: phoebe.george
comment: [~berezinez] yes, Sam is correct, the PDF he attached is correct and the approved versions.

Also, I will attach the samples from Brittany where they checked the tab test as well in OPS from the print versions.
