title: SUCU - Mo Stmt Changes for Re-launch
description: 1. Remove calculation currently in place for this field: Principal Paid This Period

Use amount pulled directly from Fiserv DNA field.

New field to be used:

"Principal paid this period" field is applicable for major code MTG, CML, CNS and position is in 4100 record pos- 262-272.

 


2. Display product sections on statement and Account Summary products in the same order as provided in the statement file.

This will require removal of the currently logic to group same product types together for display.

 

3. Replace disclosure backer with an updated TIFF image - this will be provided on 2/8.

 

4.  If there is an 'Account Description' present, display in parentheses instead of the Product Type:

In example below, replace verbiage in parentheses with Account Description from file:

 

or deposit account description is coming from record 2000 field start position 222 with length 40. 

and for loan accounts  its coming from record 4000 position 297-336

author: JIRAUSER10907
comment: Hi[~phoebe.george], we have analysed the feedbacks and our feedbacks are listed below:



1.*SAMPLE FEEDBACK FOR UPDATE:* Can the Account Description display be updated to be added after a dash and keep the Major product type in parentheses : *Yes we will able to do it*

2.*NEW REQUESTED UPDATE*: The periodic daily rate is rounded to 0.009%. The actual rate is supposed to display as 0.009375% and is what we currently display on our statements. Can you please confirm if there is programming to round this decimal and if we can remove it? : *Yes the value was rounded up but now we will remove it and display all the 6 digits*

*4.**NEW ISSUE REPORTED:* The mortgage loan is showing a duplicate line item for the Ending Balance. Can we remove the first Ending Balance line item listed below? *Yes we can remove it*

{color:#de350b}*We did not get it. Can you let us know from which datafile client is referring this account and we clearly did not understand what he meant. Also the right sides values are missing in the screenshot, did he meant this*{color}

*5.*CREDIT CARDS:

+Missing Credit Card Statements+

Lori Harding Member # 14087704 Cards ending 0107 & 4972

Lori only seems to have credit card statements from October through December even though we have loaded more months. She is also showing only one statement in each month even though she has 2 different credit cards on two different cycles.

{color:#de350b}*Not sure from which datafile this is can you please let us know*{color}

 # Please proceed with this update.
 # Please proceed with this update.
 # For item #3 (Ambassador Premier Checking), customer is nothing that the -$25.00 amount displaying under the 'Service Charges' is actually not a service charge, it should have been categorized in the 'Deposits' amount shown in the screenshot. Here is the full information for the member - is it possible to confirm why the Service Charges are pulling -$25.00 based on the program?Member Name = Dana Tehrani Member # 14288067 Acct # 701626427

Please disregard the last item for the Credit Cards - I included on this Jira ticket by mistake.


author: JIRAUSER10907
comment: Hi [~phoebe.george]

We analyzed it from the datafile, record layout and its coming from the correct record 2000 position 151-161 and in description its written as service charge. If you have any queries let us know.

comment: [~Najoa] Thank you, I have provided the information to the customer, no changes needed at this time.

Please proceed with providing samples with the current list of updates for final approval.

[~Igor.Khosid] I know there is a short amount of time until EOM, but please see if we can pre-schedule QA time for the programming updates listed on this ticket. I will consolidate the updates on the description so they are outlined clearly once the final samples are approved.

Thank you!


author: igor.khosid
comment: [~phoebe.george]- please be sure all necessary information to start testing are provided when samples are approved and
[~berezinez]will be assigned for testing

comment: Hi all, sorry, i deleted my last comment as I had a call with the SUCU just now and they may have found another issue! I'll provide another update soon depending on their findings.



Thanks!


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~Najoa] [~tanmay] I received the FINAL changes from SUCU for their monthly statements.

We are targeting to go live 3/7/22 for code release if possible (in the AM). Please let me know the soonest timeframe for final samples based on these additional changes:
 # Replace backer disclosure on back of page 1 with the new attached backer (file name: Stanford_Disclosure_Backerv3_FINAL.pdf)
 # Update APY percentage (for Savings/Dep accounts) to display using 5 decimal points also. See example on the attached screenshot for Member Number 86022 (Theodore P. Bashor). From customer: "_The APY should be 0.10% and formatted as 0.10005 (5 decimal points). The APY on the example below seems to have dropped all the zeros in between."_
 # Update APY and APR on Certificate product types also to display the full # of characters in the data file (should be up to 5 decimal places also). See attached screenshot for example for the Certificate products.

!image-2022-02-27-20-06-14-576.png!



Please let me know what is possible to help expedite these updates in order to make the 3/7 live date. Once code is released, we need to process and post these eStatements by 3/7/22.

Thanks for your help with this!

comment: HI [~phoebe.george],

*Regarding the update we have few issues.*

!apy_2250.png|width=788,height=371!


h3. {color:#172b4d}*For APY, see from the record layout its coming from position 2250 pos 69-75 and on right side its format given like 999V999 where the V denotes the decimal point that means 3digit will be before decimal point and 3digit will be after decimal point and in current code its working like that. See the image below for APR also, its working in the same way.*{color}

{color:#172b4d}*Do we still need to convert it into five dp and if so will it be applicable for loan also?*{color}

{color:#172b4d}*!apr_2250.png|width=798,height=306!*{color}


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~Najoa] Sorry, please follow the data fille. I don't think SUCU is aware of how it's coming across in the file. They mentioned that as long as it's following what is in the data file and we are not rounding up, they would like us to display the rate of however many decimal places are in the file.

Please keep it is 3 if that is how it appears in the file. Just want to ensure we are not rounding and/or dropping digits as they had noted in their #2 comment. Thanks!


author: JIRAUSER10907
comment: Ok [~phoebe.george] by changing the backer we will provide the sample

I received final approval on the latest samples for SUCU! Please proceed with preparing for QA and/or parallel.

This has to be live no later than 3/7 for release so we can re-process the 3/1 mo stmt file for posting to production.

Approved samples attached.

comment: [~Andrey.Kutsenko] [~Igor.Khosid] SUCU doesn't use house #10 env (double window), they use a single preprinted #10 outer envelopes, so the logo position should be okay as is, as it doesn't need to be positioned to the house double window. IS should not have changed logo position with the current updates on this ticket. Thanks!
