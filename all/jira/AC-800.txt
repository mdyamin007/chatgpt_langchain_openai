title: MFCU - [30642][pvt] Letter 146 Indirect Counter Offer (AL-DL-05-10/19) New Cover Letter to be sent with recreated adverse actions letters that were missing key factors
description: All these 3 letters are exactly the same analysis I think you can send one WO or 3 as you wish.

I see that on the ticket 30302 you have sent the WO . this is the Analysis.



And we DO NOT need to wait for test file we can use existing data files for testing and even get them to

approve samples - and hold the code till they provide the "Final file for which they want these letters to be added" that file is NO different from their existing files .

So once you get the 3 WO signed we can push to Jira and follow SOP and then hold till they are ready with final files for each of theses letters.
 I updated the description with this ticket name see*bolded*

-------------------------Per Carlo------------------------------------------

Please proceed with the needed modifications for this, which I think is just to program the cover letter. The data file use to reprint letter 146 for this project is not changing, so as far as data file you can use a recent production file as a test. The cover letter has no data elements.



As you proceed with development please draft the work order using the block of hours.
