This update to the EWBB eTax application in order to reprocess the 2020 1098 (EWBBML51) and 1099-INT (EWBBML61) tax files is ready for review. The e-tax posting date has been hardcoded to '12312020'.
 * Exported updated project files to\\download-nas02\qa\EWBB\EWBBML51.zip and\\download-nas02\qa\EWBB\EWBBML61.zip
 * Attached IS checklist:[^ewbbml5_ml6_is-1734_check_list.pdf]
 * The following e-Tax index files should have been posted to staging:
 ** 1098:etax_1098_12312020_50_10262022_181306_ewbb.txt
 ** 1099-INT:etax_1099INT_12312020_50_10262022_182044_ewbb

Please verify that the above tax forms are now appearing in the 2020 tab instead of 2021.

Based on the TS 27813 com 89, the client approved it
Please proceed with the final testing

[~phoebe.george] [~SamV2021]
Please confirm if the client already approved it.

I believe comment #89 in TS#27813 is the client approving the change request, and the only change is that the 2020 tax forms should appear in the 2020 tab instead of 2021 on InfoTrac, so we may not need client approval of samples if we can confirm that the change has been made on staging.

[~phoebe.george]Can you confirm?


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~SamV2021] Your are correct; my contact on this update does not have access to pilot site. She agreed for me to walk her through the Staging site on a web session so she can verify the change. However, I actually cannot access the Staging site, it looks like network has to give me access.

[~Igor.Khosid] [~Andrey.Kutsenko] Can you send me a screenshot of what you validated on staging, or can we have a quick web session so I can pull screenshots and forward to customer for confirmation?

Thanks!

comment: [~SamV2021] [~Igor.Khosid] EWBB is validating the site and they were asking if we had an example account with an existing 2021 1098 that they can confirm still shows up in the correct location (under 2021 tax year). Here is a screenshot, but the account # was not included if you by chance can locate this, or another example?

We checked this on Stage. The customer CIF you asked for, not Stage
[~SamV2021], could you help with the account #?


author: igor.khosid
comment: [~phoebe.george] [~SamV2021]
Sorry never mind I got the account number
Will send it in a few minutes

comment: [~Igor.Khosid] [~SamV2021] I'm sorry to ask this, but I have one more screenshot to request from pilot, as I still cannot access:

Account #79050182

Can you send the same two screenshots for their 1098 2021?

Thanks!


author: igor.khosid
comment: [~phoebe.george] - as I mentioned - I tested on Stage
[~SamV2021] - can you post it to Pilot?


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~Igor.Khosid] If you are able to locate this account in Staging, that would be fine too. If not, [~SamV2021] is this part of the file posted to pilot?

I can't access pilot to confirm, thank you!


author: igor.khosid
comment: [~phoebe.george] - there is only 2020
[~SamV2021] - please reply

Account#79050182 is not posted in staging for the 2021 1098 tax file (perhaps in production?).

A different account that we could use to verify that the 2021 1098 tax files are showing up correctly on staging is: acct#9140272. This account should have files posted for both 2020 and 2021 1098 tax.

[~Igor.Khosid]

Could you provide screenshots on staging foracct#9140272?

Thanks,
Sam

Hi Phoebe, any update on this?

Thanks,
Sam


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~SamV2021] sorry for the delay, EWBB is still requesting more scenarios to check (screenshots) since they don't have access to pilot. I'm still working on getting final approval, but very close!




author: phoebe.george
comment: [~SamV2021] I have received approved on this from EWBB. Let me know next steps for QA. 

Also updating due date, but we can modify depending on target release date.


author: JIRAUSER10906
comment: [~Igor.Khosid]

Hi Igor, can you confirm that QA is complete for this? I believe it is since the only change made was hardcoding the posting date to '12312020' so that the 2020 tax files show up under the 2020 tab on the admin site.

I just confirmed that parallel testing will not be needed, so we can proceed with release once we confirm that QA is complete.

Rollback will be needed once all related 2020 tax files are processed in order to process 2021 and onwards tax files.
