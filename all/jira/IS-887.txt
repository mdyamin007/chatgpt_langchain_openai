author: anwarh
comment: [~William.Kong], I'm updating them for the current month (March) but client has also requested following,

*"_Is there an automated way we can do it, even for the rate sheet or free schedule that are predictable? The issue there is the rate sheet isnt finalized until like 2 to 3 days prior to month end sometimes. There is very little lead time."_*

We may have to come up with a solutioin to automate them.
