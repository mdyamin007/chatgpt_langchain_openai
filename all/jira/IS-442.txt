comment: [~andreav]: I'm going to void this ticket out since we don't need to setup taxes this year or pre-ingestion.


author: andreav
comment: William, can you please reopen this ticket since we have to set up the 5498 forms for April? Also, we will set up all other forms after the 5498 so we can close this ticket.

We discuss this with Rony last Thursday along with Terrence during the DSi weekly call. Rony was not aware of this project but will review to confirm if his team can handle it. Concerns that Terrence brought up was since their is eTax, will there be a cross reference file and since most likely there will be PDF archival, what are the specifications. @Rony Das: Please confirm status on this resource allocation for MFCU 5498. @Diego Franco: Please confirm if we have PDF archival specs and if we need xref file for 5498 taxes

comment: Please advise who is the developer on this ASAP. Also, client is sending a new test file tomorrow. Diego will let you know where to find it.
Also, client is asking for a sample date. Please provide ASAP.
Client wants a timeline by End of this week. I need the sample (print and archival) date, pilot date and live date.

comment: [~andreav]: I've confirmed with [~rony]and [~Peter.Dang]this morning that we are 100% sure it will be [~rony]working on this project. He updated our internal resource last night confirming that [~rony]will be the developer on this project. Please coordinate with him directly.



[~rony]: Please refer to Andrea's comment above.


author: andreav
comment: Client wants a meeting this week. who in IS should be on the call since it will most likely be too late for Rony to join.


author: rony
comment: Hi [~andreav]

Please provide the test files when available. I will try to work it this weekend. I will provide a sample date on Monday. But I am hoping the sample will not take much time.


author: andreav
comment: Client sent new test file:

_Diego,

We dropped a file in the test FTP called 5498 Test File.  It has 179 5498 and 1 5498-ESA.  Please use this when producing proofs for us.  Thank you.

author: andreav
comment: Per Diego, client has approved the samples with the messages. Pending masking decision from client and production file on 4/20 to create an archival sample for approval.

[~Peter.Dang] - Please advise is this set up will need to go to QA and parallel. Per Diego, no xref required, just suppression.


author: rony
comment: Hi [~diegof]

Archival files are in /t/pdf_afp/mfcu/mfcutax/zip/ folder. Would you please put those somewhere for [~phoebe.george] or [~andreav] to access?

One thing to mention masking for archival is the same as paper. That's the standard for the tax process.



[~andreav]would you please check isd story and communicate with isd about the status of the posting.

Thanks

comment: Rony, see Sean's comment below and check that eStatement job tracking is turned on for taxes.

Sean on 19/Apr/22 2:14 PM 
 
When I post on pilot, it said estatement job tracking is not turned on. Can have the print side take a look?



author: rony
comment: Hi [~andreav]

Yes, it turned on from our side. I am not sure what might go wrong at this point.

Need help to release this project.

[^IS-442_IS_PROGRAM_TRANSFER_FORM.doc]



You will see1099sep_new.pl here which is another core script . I just added 



$| = 1;



at line 8. This will immediately flush the print command. Sometimes Perl script print command doesn't get executed immediately but gets buffered first.



Please add

mfcutax_5498gen

mfcutax_5498esagen

to paperless file.



Thanks

Rony

Following codes have been released.



mfcutax_5498gen

Forgot an important thing. We need to make soft link in /d/tax/prep/mfcu/ for

mfcu_customized_archival.pl

mfcu_post_handle.pl

mfcu_spec_handle.pl

Link name should be same as target name.
