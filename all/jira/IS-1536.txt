Here are the mapping and data files:
[^CPandMDCP( First Qual).pdf] 
[^mfcu_ODP_FIRST_QUAL_08172022_1.bin] 

Sample: 
 [^MFCUDL168.DAT.pdf] 

[~Igor.Khosid], project uploaded to QA folder. 

Note: Mapping seems weird. I made it look similar to other letters. 

Thanks,
Anwar

comment: Hi [~anwarh] ,

On Page 1. Couple changes to the last paragraph and it should read as follows
 * Overdraft Protection and Debit Card Overdraft Protection are offered at the discretion of the credit union and may be revoked, changed, or discontinued at any time. Please contact us to discuss overdraft transfer options from your other Mission Fed accounts. You can update your enrollment status for Debit Card Overdraft Protection at any time via Mobile and Online Banking and Overdraft Protection by visiting any of our branches; by calling us at 800.500.6328; or by returning the attached form. Please keep this notice with your financialrecords. Weappreciate your choosing Mission Fed and enjoy serving you.

On page 2.
 * Missing header
 * Bullet point 1. should read " We have an overdraft plan for checks and ACH transactions (Overdraft Protection) that comes automatically with your account."
 * Fix spacing issue move "Overdraft Protection:" up a space so it doesn't confuse the member
 * Missing space between "and pay"
