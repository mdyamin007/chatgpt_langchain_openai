"<DescriptionSummary> Payment</DescriptionSummary>"
2. Run the Convert xml data script:
perl ${home_master}/master/xml_conv1.pl $xmlFile wecu mv1 ${dat_outFile}

Thanks for checking. But just saying that if you test the current produciton code you would find the same issue, we just removed extra verbiages from display when the description is Payment orPeriodicFinanceCharge. Any way it's fixed now. Dfa is in parallel and project is in qa folder.



And I think we should test those things before sending sample to client going forward. Of course we have to provide you the project at that point. I will talk to Igor more on this.



Thanks
