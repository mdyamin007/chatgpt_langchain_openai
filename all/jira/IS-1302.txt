Per [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com], we want to prioritize on PDF archival set up first. so I move this project to HOLD.

comment: [~zhuoxinT]-Can you move the "700" in the signature to the third line so it reads "700 Patroon Creek Corporate Blvd"?

Screenshot attached.After this change is made, the CU will send another test file for final validation.

author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: Hi [~zhuoxinT]- Please see below response/feedback re LM007, 9 and 12 letters and see attached. The subsequent pages for 7 and 9 are completely different. Let me know if you want to add more hours to the initial estimate. Or if you need a BA to review. Thx.



In reviewing the samples from the LM007, LM009 and LM012 notices you provided previously, we identified that some parts of the original templates (which are supplied by third party entities) have been updated since the template we initially provided. To ensure these new notices are compliant, I have attached the updated templates. I recognize that these changes may require additional programming, so please let us know when your team has had a chance to review.

A high-level overview of the changes by notice:

* LM007: Page 1 remains the same, but the remaining pages either have additional verbiage or are completely updated or new to the notice.

* LM009: Page 1 remains the same, but the remaining pages either have additional verbiage or are completely updated or new to the notice.

* LM012: The only updated needed is to replace the "REMINDER" verbiage on in the top third of page 5.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need any additional information.

Thank you!

Can you please ask Ratna to review first? Because the sample I provided is formatted by using the template that Ratna provided to me.
after that, we can give an estimate on how much work we have to do.



Thanks

comment: Hi [~zhuoxinT]please find mapping templates attachedLM007 - LMP Fannie Mae_updated.pdf.pdf,LM009 - LMP Freddie Mac_updated.pdf,LM012 - LMP SEFCU_updated.pdf. I tried adding page numbers to return forms but fonts are going off when i edit in pdf. Please review if you are able to adjust font. Also, please let [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] know if it cant be done. In that case, we will have to remove page numbers altogether on all return forms.



[~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]I do not have any questions for CU at this time. I will wait for[~zhuoxinT]to review and let us know if he has any.



Thanks
