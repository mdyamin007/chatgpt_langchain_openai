I don't think there's a need for jobs sync scripts since if we create a new job on pdtools Jenkins, we can just create the same job on the new instance. I don't see us creating any new jobs anyway. Syncing jobs might lead to overwriting configurations specific to the new instance also.

And last I heard, the sync has to be manual to prevent accidental corruption of data.

comment: DSI has stated that they have finished this.
