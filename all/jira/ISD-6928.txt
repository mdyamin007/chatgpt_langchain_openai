comment: [~barnetts] This looks like adding two new e-notices and resources, but I don't see any ISD hours. Please add 4 hours (2 per enotice) to the ISD ticket. Thanks

UTCU has updated the specs. They want to remove (BUSINESS_ODLC - DL021) and have a minor verbiage change. I am working on updating the ticket. They will also send a new data file. 

Thanks, Barnett

The verbiage looks the same.

The parallels have passed. Can you please release code early? UTCU is okay with code being released before due date. 

Thanks, Barnett

022 - ODLC DISCLOSURE
023 - ODLC DISCLOSURE
