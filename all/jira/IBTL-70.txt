Will, when running the archival e option for amacln4, the following error was encounted:



Traceback (most recent call last):

comment: [~tient]: Thanks reporting this issue. Hosein also reported this issue on Friday. The root cause of the issue is due to hard coded database IP address in the python code:

https://jira.infoimageinc.com/browse/IBTL-68

I've asked Hosein and Peter to see if they can update the codes. I will keep this ticket assigned to me until they confirmed it is fixed and released.

comment: [~tient]: Hosein made the code adjustment in "Menlo Parallel" and plan to release the changes to "Menlo Production". But in the meantime, I manually synced the "Menlo Parallel" code to "Brisbane Parallel" for the following two files:



/home/test/master/afp2pdf_report_handler.py

/home/test/master/afp2pdf_report_info_collector.py



This should address the database error.



Can you please retest also?

Looks good now. Thanks Will

comment: [~tient]: Can you help me do one more test? Can you benchmark the performance between Menlo & Brisbane in parallel mode? I'm a little worried that these "fresh install" preprocessing## servers might have slowness issue.

comment: [~William.Kong] the jobs I'm testing are really small so they ran super fast.

comment: [~tient]: Nevermind then. You are right. I will need a bigger job to be able to confirm the benchmarking result. Let's cancel for now.
