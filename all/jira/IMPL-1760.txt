title: EQBK - Merger with American State Bank & Trust (Pre-enrollment & Mapping
description: One time update for the merger:

1. Pre-enrollment processing - test file attached.

These are the business requirements they confirmed for pre-enrollment setup:

For customers on the pre-enrollment list, they will be flagged as electronic delivery, but will be forced to go through the enrollment process in order to accept EQBKs current Enrollment Disclosure.



FINAL pre-enrollment file to arrive 10/1 by 9am PST. Request to load by end of day on 10/1.

Customer also noted the following with the test file:

_There are a handful of accounts that are missing the delivery preference indicator, due to some data issue in the ASBT core. I am researching, and should know more next week._

_Also, I added a code for the delivery preference, "B", for both, meaning that customers receive both a paper statement and have estatements._



NOTE: We will not use their current 'enrollment' process due to the logic to revert back customers that have not logged in within 30 days.



2. Mapping file from old to new account number for document migration.
 - EQBK to provide legacy EQBK account #'s for migrating current history.

 - Provided file with the information and will need the history of the 'old' account number migrated to the 'new' account number.

Pipe delimited .txt file

Old_Account_Number|Old#_Account_Type|New_Account_Number|New#_Account_Type

File name = eqbk_merger_remap_MMDDYYYY.txt

File attached.





NOTE: ISD Assessment from ticket, but we will not be using existing enrollment process:

EQBK has an enrollment (paperless) file setup with us. They should be able to use this to pre-enroll all of the merger accounts. In fact, on the day when they want the file to be run, they should be able to send the file directly over the scanner, and it would be automatically processed.


There are a few things to keep in mind:
 # CIF should be unique.
 # Accounts should be unique (number + type).
 # These relationships should be put into the auth file. Otherwise, the auth file would just remove them and unenroll the accounts.
 # Account types should match what Print would be using.
 # If specs are matched exactly with the existing enrollment setup, test files should be put into the test folder. Otherwise the scanner would trigger automatic processing. Alternatively, name test file differently so that it won't be recognized.

We can test things out on pilot to make sure it all works as expected.



Estimate: 5 hours. Just the cost of someone providing support and help with testing before live date.

comment: Reference team support ticket #21731 for updates with customer.

Final pre-enrollment file and re-mapping file received 10/1/21 and loaded as of 10/1 to production.

Pre-enrollment file had 1,316 records that did not contain an email address, so these were not updated to electronic delivery and remain as paper delivery.
