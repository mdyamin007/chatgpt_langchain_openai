I have merged [cid]_springRemoved branch to trunk for FLCU, CAMB, KYCU, MPCU and MVCU. I haven't deployed it on pilot.

Also I have found that in /dso/test.jsp page of FLCU it shows status 404 while loading dummystatement.pdf and in /dso/enroll3.jsp page it shows status 500 while generating security code. Do you know if FLCU uses DSO or not?

Thanks.

It may not be in use, but let's fix these anyway. Usually, the URL would not be accessible if it was unavailable to the client. Maybe they have stopped using it, but in case that they do start using it, we should fix it before they find out.

The pdf should be simple enough. Change it to the correct name SampleStatement.pdf.

For the Security Code, would it be difficult to fix? It seems to be some NullPointer exception.

Thanks,
Tai
