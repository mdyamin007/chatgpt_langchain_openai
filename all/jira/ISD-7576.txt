title: 31445 JDCU - eStatements Unavailable
description: Hi DSI,

Could you research and see why the following account is not accessible by the vendor? ISD has checked the accessed logs but could not find any match SSO request on 8/2.



JDCU reports some account could not load estatements since 8/2.

Account Numbers:

106331-5
42945-9

JDCU's comment regarding accessing logs:

I requested the tracking logs from our website vendor for the account 42945-9 and this is what they provided me:

2022-08-02 17:03:38,028 INFO c.i.t.controller.DISSOTPVController [V0000->01674:42945:GCP_iPhoneBankingApp_5d78a48c-bb8a-47d0-b259-06d5262f05c6:104.245.23.147] - User invoked DISSO Redirect URL for TPV_INFOIMAGE_OS, for FI: 01674, TPV: TPV_INFOIMAGE_OS, time spent in DISSO: 949

Reviewing activity reports for JORDAN FEDERAL CREDIT UNION, and users accessing this SSO, there were only 3 failures in Activity Reports at:
08/02/2022 @ 1:33:55 PM
08/02/2022 @ 11:59:08 AM
08/02/2022 @ 11:30:27 AM


Engineering has enabled SSO tracing for TPV_INFOIMAGE_OS, will keep task open to pull logs, however as of right now, any error the users are receiving is entirely on the OLS Vendor, as we are successfully redirecting us
They are still working on providing me with the esite certificate.
