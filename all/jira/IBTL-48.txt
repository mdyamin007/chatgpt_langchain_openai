title: ETABoard:  Update DPVS Code Logic (Synchronize w/ Menlo)
description: There is some code updates Terrence is working w/ Peter on to make sure the presort break down report in the DVPS is in sync with the Linux DPVS code. 



Peter & Tina reported that ETABoard presort breakdown report does not match up with the physical DPVS report that gets printed. Terrence is to sync the logic into the ETABoard as well.

comment: [~Terrence.Tong]: Per our Wednesday Weekly IS Brisbane meeting, you will resume this task next month when Peter has the logic in place for the print dpvs script. Afterwards, you will mirror the dpvs logic into the ETABoard Brisbane instance as well.
