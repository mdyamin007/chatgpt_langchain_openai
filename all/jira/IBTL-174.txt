title: RHT Server error (calling menlo IPs from brisbane)
description: Hi [~William.Kong],

We are getting an error from get_infotrac.pl and get_msg_v2_cu_std.pl scripts.

Most probable cause maybe, they are calling Menlo services from Brisbane.

Menlo's IPs are hardcoded in those scripts, we may need to change them.

Here, I couldn't connect to the server (10.8.8.222:9090 or 10.8.9.20:9090) from RHT

comment: [~anwarh]: Thanks for reporting the issue. Apparently i did not do a daily sync of Menlo code to Brisbane server.  I've setup a cron job to sync the Menlo rht:/home/dsi/* at 9pm daily.



Now that the code is in sync, you should not see any hardcoded IP address as we have fixed this a few months ago.
