comment: [~jharvey]I see attached SHEL specs. Per document, we need to show return mail tab on Infotrac UI. We will not be sending any weekly report to customer. Let me know if my assessment is right.

We need to provide the report via FTP.  Did I miss that on the questionnaire?


author: anil.dasa
comment: [~jharvey] Yes, we need information for below. If we need to send encrypted report, we need PGP key from customer. For sending report, we need to know secure location. Information is not updated on document.
