Please see request from client

1) Can we please add in the "$" in front of the amounts?  I realize we neglected to include those in the template. 

2) Can we please make a change to the "RE:" line?  Towards the top of the letter on the RE: portion, can we change it from Full Payment Due on Past Due loan to Full Balance Due on Past Due Loan?

I have made the changes in to both in the template and attached it here. [^Demand Letter - Solutions (1).docx] 

Thank you!
