comment: [~nischala.manjunath]- Feedback from WEST - "The Type of Account is incorrect. It list the customer name instead of type  example Business Star CKG."



Do you see Business Star CKG in the data?

comment: [~nischala.manjunath]- FYI - Updated the SOW with...

1. File naming convention - will coordinate testing in the next week or so.

2. Print Duplex - NO the individual account statement does not need to start on a new paper. EX. If the summary statement ends on page 3, the next statement can start on the back of that paper.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: Hi [~nischala.manjunath]- Please see attached updates requested from the bank. Please note, the+Business Star Statement+ section item (1) is being evaluated by Enrico. We'll discuss in the internal call next week. Thx.

comment: [~nischala.manjunath]- I confirmed with the bank that there will NOT be any 3 digit code that is missing. There may be other 3 digit codes in the CIF file but those will be for non-analysis accounts. Thanks.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: Hi [~nischala.manjunath]- 1 more update request from the bank.

Can you please place the name and address on subsequent pages like the Savings statements? See attached.

comment: Hi [~nischala.manjunath]- Got some feedback. Please see attached and let me know if you have any questions. The only one I wasn't sure about was the 2nd item on the first point. Can we move down the data on the 2nd page like they want?

author: nischala.manjunath
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] - Sample westaa1_sample3.pdf is placed in your ac secure share. I made the updates mentioned in the word doc. Also, the statements are 2 sided/duplex.
Page breaks are received in the data but samples may not match the page breaks on there because I had to extract all the data before displaying it on the statement to space out the columns, lines etc. Also, the font and margins affect the output.

I did come across an issue for Business Star statements. Account 0169626629 is not present in the CIF file to extract the 3 digit code for Type of Account under Relationship Summary. Also, account 0169909819 has 012 as the code in the CIF file which is not defined. Please advise on how to handle these scenarios.
Thanks!

comment: Hi [~nischala.manjunath]- Please also generate a sample of the special file with the HOLD statements for the bank to review.

comment: Hi [~nischala.manjunath]- Can you locate in the old test files you have? If not, they just set up the automation to send us the production files. We just received one 9/16. Can you look at this data file?

comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] - I do have the old test files - "account nalysis stmt Jan 6 many accts.txt" which I used to generate samples on the 14th and "account analysis stmt Jan 14 acct 9417.txt" which seems to only contain one combined statement/account. Is this the hold file? 
I did look at WEST_AA_stmt_16092022.TXT but its empty.

comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] - If they're in the data, how do I identify hold accounts? Based on the SOW I thought hold accounts will be sent in a separate file - WEST_AAHOLD_<mmddyyyy>.txt.
I checked the data files and they're all empty.



author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~nischala.manjunath]- Apologies. You are absolutely right. Let me take this back to the bank. Will confirm shortly.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: Hey [~nischala.manjunath]- you're correct. HOLD's will come in separate file. Production test file will be sent early October. We can test then.



In the meantime, they do have feedback. Will upload here as soon as I receive. Thx.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: Hi [~nischala.manjunath]- Please see attached feedback. THe bank provided one of their old AA statements along with one of ours. They've made edit requests on our PDF sample and provided the old one for reference. Please review and let me know if you have any questions. Her handwriting is ok. Not hard to read but not that easy.

comment: Hi [~nischala.manjunath]- Just an FYI - I confirmed with the bank that there will be NO HOLD codes in the data. I've updated the SOW.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: HI [~nischala.manjunath]- One thing I forgot to mention is that the bank stated they think most of the issues lie with the font. It's a bit smaller than what they're send out now (see attached). Can you enlarge to match the sample?

author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: Hi [~nischala.manjunath]- 1 more request from the bank. This has to do with when you generate samples. For the next set, please generate samples from the test file you previously had.

The bank would also like specific accounts from the file sent around7/7/22. I didn't get setup for file conf until August so I'm unable to confirm. Can you tell me if we received one? It should have the accounts below in it. Please generate a sample file for these accounts and a FULL PDF for the entire file.

comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] [~enricob]- Sample is placed in your ac-secure-share directory. 
westaa1114_sample.pdf contains all the accounts and westaa1114.qa.pdf contains the accounts mentioned above in the previous comment (313109563 is not present in the data).
I made most of the updates mentioned in the feedback and increased the font and margins to try and match the sample they sent. 
The only update they requested that I can't code for is the page break in the middle of the transactions for eg in the Service Detail section, there may be cases where the description header on the left may be on its own and the sub-text will be on the next page because this is dependent on the margins and font.
  !screenshot-2.png|thumbnail! 

I did come across a few accounts numbers for Business Star statements that are missing in the CIF file. Type of Account is currently left blank for those in the samples. There are also accounts that are present in the CIF file but have an undefined code.
Account numbers are that missing in the CIF file - 0169626629, 0356071266, 0250999836
Account numbers with undefined codes - 0169909819 (012), 0401175260 (031), 0401258421 (011), 0511002149 (012), 0511992299 (012), 0511992307 (031).

comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] - Archival sample, Westamerica-XAA-Statements-01062022.zip.pgp is placed in your ac-secure-share directory. 
Field 11 in the index file has "Account Analysis" which is of length 16 instead of 10 as mentioned in the SOW, please let me know if I need to update that. Also, I used Statement Date from the data for both Open Date and Close Date.
Thanks!

comment: Hi [~nischala.manjunath]- Per our conversation...

1. Please regenerate PDF samples only for the 12/2021 data file. Please raise the verbiage on the 1st page by half an inch and then extend the box headers.

2. Please generate a FULL PDF file with the new data file below. Please also generate a PDF archival based on this file.

For the CIF file issues, can you try using the latest CIF file in the FTPBU/DDA folder? Per FIS:
|I browsed the most recent CIF file we created last night. Below are my findings. Something doesn't agree between what you're seeing versus what I am. Let me know how I can assist. Missing numbers 0169626629, 0356071266, and 0250999836 - I see all three in the file. 0169909819 - not an account on file 0401175260 - account type is '061' 0401258421 - account type is '060' 0511002149 - account type is '060' 0511992299 - account type is '060' 0511992307 - account type is '061'|

comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] - I don't see a file from June but the data file I used for the latest samples that they sent on 10/06 is dated June 10th. Do they mean that?


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: Hi [~nischala.manjunath]- Quick question. Yes, I agree, the file sent in October was dated June. You used this data file to generate the sample PDF "westaa1110.pdf" right? I'm just trying to understand why the date on the statements is September.


author: nischala.manjunath
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] - Yes, that's correct. The data has it as September.

comment: Hi [~nischala.manjunath]- WEST reported they do not see ALL of the files for the samples you turned over for the file on 10/6 and from December. Did you generate ALL the statement samples?


author: nischala.manjunath
comment: Hi [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] - Yes, I did. westaa1110.pdf should contain all the accounts in WEST_AA_stmt_061022.TXT.pgp. Are they looking for specific account numbers? I can check if they're present in the data if so.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: Hi [~enricob]- Please see attached feedback. I don't understand it so I'm going to ask to review tomorrow in our meeting with the bank. They did point out page break issues and I know we've been going back and forth on other apps regarding these.
