comment: Hi [~Shun.Kuwashima]

The client is asking the preliminary live date for this project, could you please check the current timeline in the description above and confirm the ISD ePilot sample date, so we could confirm the targeted Live date to the client?

Thank you!

comment: Hi [~Juliana Vannik], yes the timeline looks good on our end. Note that we would need the IS portion to be ready as well, since we receive the estatement index files from them for posting on the sites.
