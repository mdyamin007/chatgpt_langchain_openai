This project is on track for Loan Bill (print image and xml) archival samples tomorrow. Samples will be to verify that "DO NOT MAIL" no longer appears on index file.



Thanks

Archival samples have been placed in client pickup folder. Since no changes were made to actual statements, I went ahead and bypassed sample review. Change was only for index file.

Per HTBK:**

I have reviewed the samples for LB1 and LB2 with the coding change for using the customer name in place of Do Not Mail in the index file.

I also reviewed several of the samples without Do Not Mail to ensure the correct customer name is in the index file.

They look good to me and samples are approved.

For the email notification when files are submitted, please send to [help.desk@heritagebanknw.com|mailto:help.desk@heritagebanknw.com]
