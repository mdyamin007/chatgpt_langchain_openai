title: Hide email related verbiage when SMS is selected
description: On the profile page, If any account does not have an email address but "SMS" is selected in the radio button, the verbiage is shown saying that "This account does not have any E-mail Address.". But, as, SMS is selected, this email-related verbiage should not be displayed.

comment: This update will hide email related verbiage on profile page when sms radio button is selected and vice versa. 
 Previously, On the profile page, If any account does not have an email address but "SMS" is selected in the radio button, the verbiage is shown saying that, "This account does not have any E-mail Address.". But, as, SMS is selected, this email-related verbiage should not be displayed. Similarly, No phone related verbiage should be displayed when email radio button is selected. This is a global update so testing with multiple CIDs will be required. Need to test with byUfa clients who have both email and sms.
This update is currently deployed on stage.

Would you please provide a few CIDs and accounts to test with and without email addresses?
