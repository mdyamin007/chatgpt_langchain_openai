The index file doesn't have the corresponding id in IS DB!

comment: Hi [~zhuoxinT] [~gthillaivel],

This is impacted by an ongoing selective insert project ISD-8051. It involves IS making updates to the index files for ms1, mv1 and me1 to include piece codes and so I had to make a configuration update as well. Luckily it also involves updating the file format so that it runs with the newer process (doc processing) rather than the old one (afp processing). So for this story specifically, we need to remember to run the index files with afp processing instead of doc. 

I reran the index file successfully on stage.
