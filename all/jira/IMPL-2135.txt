title: BRIL:[pvt][29036] Setup eStatement Files and Revert to Paper Process 
description: 1. Reference EQBK process for the enrollment/revert to paper update and replicate for Brilliant Bank (BRIL) setup; reference JEF #48443 and TS#18069, comment #37
Update the Paperless Management report to have an expiration for new users to 30 days. If after 30 days, the enrolled account is still not linked to any enrolled user, the account will be reverted back to paper statements.
 
2. Setup process to provide BRIL with Paperless Report and External Enrollment File; same as what is currently in place for EQBK.
Files will still be dropped into EQBK Client Pickup folder, but labeled as BRIL.
