Are you still on track to provide samples on 10/3?

Yes, I'm track to provide the index files to QA on 10/3

Can you post the index file to pilot first and then post on stage for QA?

I tried to post the files you mentioned above but I noticed that there is no associated DT_JOB_ID.

I have reprocessed with a DT_JOB_ID. Please post the index file to pilot first and then on stage for QA:

In pilot PUI I got the same missing DT_JOB_ID error. In stage DT_JOB_ID is present but I got ESTMT_JOB_TRACKING error. The error message is "ESTMTJOBTRACKING is not Y".

Maybe the account numbers aren't populated, need to check with ISD

[~mamunur.rashid] 
I have attached a few of the accounts from the screenshot errors coming from BT-418. Can you please confirm that these account numbers are correct for these members?
Attached account text file:[^1098_accountNum_with_warning.txt]

I have also processed for pilot, can you post these index files to pilot?

Any update on samples?


author: JIRAUSER11103
comment: [~Kbittmann] 
For the client to check it has to be posted on pilot so we're waiting on ISD to post and respond

[~mamunur.rashid] 
Please let Kris know when you have posted it on pilot.

I noticed that the files are posted on pilot but not approved. The approval status is "Waiting for
DP to Release".

As mentioned in the previous comment, that ISD needs to check

[~mamunur.rashid] 
Please respond to the previous comment about the error in BT-418.

I already added a comment on BT-418. Those errors occurred because those accounts are not present in ISD database and we are not creating accounts from etax process. Should we create new account from etax process?


author: JIRAUSER11103
comment: [~mamunur.rashid] 
 Are those accounts only missing in the test environment? Or are those accounts seen in the production, but not the test?
 In terms on creating new accounts, that's a question for an ISD manager to determine whether or not to do that.

Client approved samples in pilot.

Can you confirm if we have printed statements setup for taxes? I checked SOW but I think it's only setup for archival. Can you confirm?


author: JIRAUSER11103
comment: [~Kbittmann] 
Yes, I see that the production folder has a dpvs and afps for the print step and the log says that it ran the paper option.

Also I just wanted to let you know that there were some errors that QA found and after talking about it in my team meeting, I had asked ISD if the issue with certain account numbers are due to issues with the test environment they're checking or if it is also seen in their production. If they see that the production also does not contain those account numbers, then it would be a question to the client. As of Friday, we're still waiting on a response from ISD.

Including this comment I provided in BT-418 on this Jira ticket:
As previously mentioned, this issue that QA provided showed that there were errors with some account numbers when posting to stage. According to ISD, 3 of the 5 sample accounts I obtained from the screenshot provided inBT-418are not present in the ISD database. Please confirm with the client that these sample accounts are the correct member numbers to use.

To be clear, these are just *sample*accounts not in the ISD database.

The sample accounts:
Member name   | Account # | Suffix
MARK LACHANCE  1474350  142
STEVEN CHARLES  1481200  144
DUANE A LITZAU  1485040  142

I wanted to confirm that samples had already been approved according the comment made on 10/7 by Joye


author: JIRAUSER10911
comment: [~Natalie.Tom]

That is correct.


author: JIRAUSER10911
comment: [~Natalie.Tom]

Client says these accounts are okay.

comment: [~gthillaivel] [~Kbittmann]
As per [~TunA], some of the tax resources are very centralized and many programmers are working on them at the same time, so the parallel ID holding the etax.control file for this update was released.

Please continue to follow up on the BT-418 issue as we still need to finish QA and go through parallel.

[~Natalie.Tom]
Closing the ticket with the comment as per Shun: Etax index files don't contain account name, so any new accounts created will show 'Member' instead. Since this is stage, it is likely that most accounts will look like this.

Can you attach IS checklist
