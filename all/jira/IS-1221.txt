title: EWBB - Stmt - Foreign Currency DDAPDFi Conversion to AFP2PDF Python [InHse]
description: Update existing processing script to no longer use PDFi tool to create pdf.
 Instead use afp2pdf.py program with index_build_multicore option for ALL statement related apps.
 The smaller daily notice jobs can use the current index_build options.

All the zip file, pgp encryption, index file contents, and PDF file naming convention must remain exactly the same original specifications.

Please ensure the standard SOP on the directory structure must be followed: 
 ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/pdf, ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/zip, ${d_dir}/$cid/$cid$jid/work is followed.
 Also, clear the folder directory folder before each processing. We do NOT want to accumulate previous runs.

The current program should support checking total PDF counts verification to make sure the expected pdf matches the total number for pdfs generated; If not, incorporate this standard verification logic

DT_JOB_ID:
 133589-C00.01-V21799

Processing Scripts to modify:
 ewbb_fcdda_process.sh

Data Files to use:
 ewbb_fcdda_20220531.txt.pgp



*NOTE*: This job runs on RH2. Since we are migrating from RHS to RH2, we should test all options so that we can do afpcompare and also ensure there is no errors in the processing logs.

comment: [~anwarh]/Salman: I don't believe all job_sel options were ran. I need to see the big afp file in /z/afpformat as well.



Here's the data file I would like you to re-run all options:

[williamK@rhs2 ~]$ perl /home/util/get_processed_filename.pl prod ewbb 2417501
cid: ewbb
jid: fa1
proc_id 2417501
file_name: ewbb_fcdda_20220818.txt.pgp
md5 6871b03ad0b85cb2bba562bbcf4cf9f3



I've placed this file into the internal parallel ftp scanner so that you can re-run with this file (i.e./z/infoftp_int/ewbb/FCDDA/)



Please update status to "QA Request" when you are done re-run*+all+* job_sel options.

I've just ran the script with all the job_sel options that it is used for with the data file you mentioned.
Please find the newly generated output in the aforementioned path. Addtionally, I am changing the status of this ticket to "QA Request" as per your instruction.

Thanks,
Salman.
