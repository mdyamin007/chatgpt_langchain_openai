title: FCSB - [26705][pvt] Adverse Action Notice Corrections
description: Create enotice index file manually for 5 accounts. -Also take down the old ones on production.-

I have another request similar to 26297; they would like us to upload the PDFs attached in comment 3 to the admin site.

---------------------per Shun---------------------------

Based on the existing notices and the pdf filenames they provided, I think I have all the information necessary for posting. Replacing the existing notices would require us to do a manual removal, so I would say 2 hours total (1 for removal and 1 for posting the new ones).



No sample date

Live date 3/4

Here is the client's feedback:

"These look good. The only question I have is concerning the date. Can we have them all be posted on 2/15/22? That was the date these were mailed and the dateon page 2 of each."
