Assessments

1. create resources for each insert - can probably use S1SNFIN[1-6].300 for the 9 inserts

-Excessive NSF insert is in production - S1SNFNSF.300, can reuse this for 7th insert

2. read in each file list into array in SNFBMS11.dfa

3. after the PRINT_CHK... format, check

-if account exists in array list, assign insert flag=1

 ex. Excessive NSF variable will be insert7_flag.

    If account is in the NSF array, assign insert7_flag==1

4. check to see which insert flag is on then display that insert

-there should be a max of 3 inserts - 1 Excessive NSF insert, 1 Sign&Save insert and 5 Change in Terms inserts (should only be 1 of each account) -*confirm if more than 3 inserts, display all inserts but put warning???*

-order of inserts should be as :

 a. For Savings statements: Savings Change in Terms, Sign&Save Match and then if the savings has an Excessive OD notice add it last.

  b. For savings accounts that are combined with a checking, and the checking is on the Excessive OD list: Excessive OD list, Savings Change in Terms and then Sign&Save Match
