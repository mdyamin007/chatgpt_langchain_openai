I see two ISD ticket. I don't think that was intentional, right?

Customer responded on ticket 19853:

FYI, we were testing the end-to-end file transfer process and there is a new test file in the \Test folder of your FTP site. We had to rename the file inside the zip to Solar Loans Data. Would you be able to provide a sample for this test file in addition to the first test file?

As for the questions from your IT team:

1. Yes, you may use the Account Number + Loan ID to uniquely identify the records.

2. Yes, we request that the welcome letter be emailed to those members who have opted to receive communication electronically vs. printed. All the rest, should be printed and mailed.

If the words regarding the blank page may be added, that would be great.
