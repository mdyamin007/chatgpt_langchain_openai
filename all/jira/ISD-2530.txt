title: 12119 - APCU - Research Why YA1 Was Set Up as mortgage instead of Escrow
description: Seems like the client wants to use a different email template for ya1. It was set up as Mortgage instead of Escrow. Talk to AC and figure out why; and whether it should have been set up as Escrow. Also determine whether we want to switch it to Escrow so it has its own email template.
