title: STAR: DDA Check Images - Updating Check Image Display
description: We can adjust the image width and height in the PRINT_CHECK module.
 Update STARMS11.dfa 
 IMG_WIDTH = (8.5-$MR_LEFT/1440-$MR_RIGHT/1440-(COL_NUM-1)*
 &H_GUTTER)/COL_NUM ;
 IMG_HEIGHT = (11-ROW_NUM*TEXT_HEIGHT-$MR_TOP/1440-$MR_BOTTOM/
 1440-(ROW_NUM-1)*&V_GUTTER)/ROW_NUM ;
 ImgPerPage was dynamically extracted from Primary tag.for each account.
 For this update, we need to create a customized PRINT_CHECK module.



Check display logic
 * 0 = none
 * 1 = Fronts only
 * 2 = Fronts and Backs
 * 3 = Debit/Credit Fronts & Credit Backs

Note:

We can adjust the width of check images. Currently at width=2.375

Check image height was fixed and controlled by number of checks per page.
