title: SFCE - [22603][pvt] KEYS-117 New Daily Notice
description: Current, I see only one SFCE daily notice application (DLA). The data file for that application is xml data files and come inside following zip file name (/d/infoftps4/switchthink/sfce/dn/sfce_mmddyy_dn_1.zip.pgp).



Here is a few items to confirm with client:
 - Can the client sent this new data file inside same zip file?

 - What is the data file naming convention this notice, when we go live?

 - Can we use all black and white (including logo)? Because the PDF template has color log.

Nar - wondering if you need to update the procs file as well? Because this is the new notice

Daphne - please attached updated SOW

Gnana - please continue with testing


author: dyuen
comment: Sorry about that [~Igor.Khosid], here is the updated SOW:

comment: Daphne:

I am not sure why the SOW's letter codes are so different than the program letter codes.

SOW are 1 to 13.

The program starts at 102 to 110:

!image-2021-11-03-09-17-54-596.png!

So I use 111 for the new letter to keep flow with the logic.


author: william.kong
comment: [~dyuen]: The deadline I set for 11/8 is putting is too close. Looks like there is still some internal back & forth. If you think we can get QA & Parallel to finish by 11/5, then we can go with the 11/8 date. [~jira_naru]may have a bit of wiggle room to adjust.



However, if you don't and you feel it is putting too much strain in the internal team, then I can propose the following:





QA Completion: 11/5 (Please confirm if [~Igor.Khosid]agrees)

Parallel Start: 11/8

Code Release: 11/10

First Cycle Using New Logic: 11/11





Please let me know your decision because I want to update this ticket to the correct Due Date so that we know when the code will be released.

QA almost completed the testing. We were waiting for the actual print samples.


author: william.kong
comment: [~dyuen]: Please advise on the revised timeline i mentioned above unless we can get commitments from OPS that they can finish Parallel by Friday after QA is done today.



Please advise [~jira_naru]& [~TunA]with your feedback. Thanks!


author: dyuen
comment: [~William.Kong], [~Igor.Khosid]is validating print samples. Once validated, i will submit a parallel to OPS and confirm if they can commit to finishing the parallel by Friday. Thanks

comment: Thank you [~Igor.Khosid]!

[~gthillaivel]and [~jira_naru], Masterparallel #23907 created and assigned to Nar. Thanks!


author: jira_naru
comment: TS23907, completed.




author: william.kong
comment: Per [~jira_naru]: Currently in Parallel.



[~dyuen]: Once parallel passes we need to determine revised live date. For now, i will mark tentatively next Wednesday. Please advise if Wednesday is ok. If not, please let us know which date will work.


author: dyuen
comment: [~William.Kong], why are we pushing out the live date? I confirmed with OPS that parallel will be completed today.


author: jira_naru
comment: Daphne:

It looks like the parallel has completed.

I am reluctant to release over the weekend since SFCE has not confirm the production file name for this new letter.

Could the production file name be,YYYYMMDD_XXXXXX_XXX.Opt_In_Overdraft_Protection_Letter_Pipe_Delimited_Output_{color:#FF0000}Log{color}.txt?


author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~jira_naru], sounds reasonable. Let's hold code release until SFCE can confirm the production file name.

Thanks


author: dyuen
comment: [~jira_naru], the client agreed to your suggestion for filename:OPT_IN_OVERDRAFT_PROTECTION_MMDDYYYY.txt

However, they won't be ready until 11/15 for a go live. Can we push out the live to then?

Thanks


author: jira_naru
comment: Daphne,

OK, that is fine with me.


author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~jira_naru], just a friendly reminder from the client. The Opt In Data file will be included inthe daily notice package: sfce_[MM][DD][YY]_dn_.zip.pgp

Thanks


author: jira_naru
comment: Daphane:

That will be great.
