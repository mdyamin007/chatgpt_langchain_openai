title: Enrollment Process - Update to Prevent Notification Preference From Being Updated Without a Valid Change
description: The function that update the notification preference blindly sets all notification preference to N first. This causes the NP record to always be updated even if there was no actual change.

Change the code to make updates based on the np data. The setters should already be comparing the values and checking for a difference in the existing data, so we only need to change the logic on where the setters are called. No need to compare the values.
