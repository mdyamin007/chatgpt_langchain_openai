By how much does the logo need to be shifted to the left?

Since the blue lines had measured horizontally until the end of the logo, it seemed that the logo is outside of the box by 3/8". I moved the logo over by a little more than 3/8"

As for the vertical position of the logo, the blue lines are confusing comparing both screenshots 2 and 3. Screenshot 2 measured from the middle of the window to the bottom of the date which is outside of the window and screenshot 3 measured outside the top and bottom of the window so I just moved it down by a little more than 3/8".

The letter is from the pdf that the client sent and it's displayed as is. The only thing I had to add is the mailing address and logo.
