author: yameelee
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]Per Peter, we cannot start on this project as we do not have SOW for this setup. Do you have that?


author: yameelee
comment: [~jasonV]in the main time please go through the PDF on redtitan and also print AFP to see if there is any issue with OMR since the margin for the statement is too close to OMR.


author: JIRAUSER11003
comment: [~yameelee]I will see if there is any issues with the margin for the statement


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~yameelee]- SOW Link added to description.


author: yameelee
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com], since this has its own SOW and also a different zip file from Daily Letter B, please advise if it is supposed to be set up as a separate application or to add on to Daily Letter B, as the CID name on the JIRA.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~yameelee]- This will be setup as it's own app since it's coming from a 3rd party vendor.


author: yameelee
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] Please include Jason and this application in today's turnover meeting.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~jasonV]- From the bank...The file attached contains about 16 pages of letters. It is data from another credit union, so please be very restrictive with your use and make sure to delete it once your testing is completed. These letters are in the same format that will be used for First Financial Bank.

Stephen - 
1. It sounds like the logo address need to be moved to the right about 1/4"
2. Could you please check with the client if it is ok to display "App Source" >> City
See below

author: yameelee
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com] ,

Jason will update the return address block.

Please confirm with client to make sure they are ok with the "Salt Lake City showing on the window, otherwise Laser might have to fold it a bit off to not have it show on window.

We won't make the LIVE date of 3/1. I don't think we can do parallel until after monthend either. So new LIVE DATE might have to be 3/10 or 3/11. Please confirm if OK for those dates.


author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: [~yameelee] [~Igor.Khosid] [~jasonV] - Salt Lake City showing is fine. Can we try to push this through next week so we can parallel test the week of 3/7? I'd like to try to get this out sooner.

author: JIRAUSER11003
comment: [~stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com]can you please have the client send a new datafile with valid addresses. The Program cannot create IMB as the full zip code and delivery point is needed. I tested with the datafile [^Allegro_Sample_AA_02082022.pdf]

author: stephen.yee@infoimageinc.com
comment: Hey [~jasonV]- One update request from the bank. See below and attached.

Based strictly on the formatting of the letter, the only change I would request is that the dealer name & address be moved directly under App Source. It is shifted to the right and can interfere with Date field.
