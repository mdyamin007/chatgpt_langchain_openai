title: Color mismatch in logo and text headings
description: Color green in the customer's logo and the rest of the document is not the same.
The difference is, subjectively, rather slim (see the attachments), but I can spy it in print samples with naked eye.

The customer did not insist for the colors to exactly match and approvals will take time so I think we should proceed for the sake of speed. I'mjust noting the issue if we need to come back to it.
