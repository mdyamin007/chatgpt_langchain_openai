comment: As soon as possible, we would like to move towards using the Brisbane Jenkins for deployment entirely. There is a way to set it up so that jobs can share configurations. So if we start using the Brisbane now to do deployment for Menlo, any configurations we change will also be used for when we deploy to Brisbane servers after the move.

comment: Hi Kent,

I tried ssh to webapp-prod09 and webapp-prod10, but the terminal just hangs.

All the other servers are good.
