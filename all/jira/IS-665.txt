If "REGULAR PAYMENT" or "payoff" verbiage found in transaction description, do not print anything in "Other" column and print 133-146 value in transaction description like we used to do. If those verbiages are not found in transaction description, check if 133-146 value matches with "principal" column value. If not matches, print 133-146 value in "Other" column, otherwise don't print anything in "Other" column.
