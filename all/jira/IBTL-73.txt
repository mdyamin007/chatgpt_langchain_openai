comment: [~hkhosravani](07:58) K Hosein: "(Offline) Hi Will, the initial issue was resolved by yamee's solution. but the other issue i got was the I3.socket.pl : Per your Spark comment "



I3.socket.pl is a known global dependency issue that we are waiting for ISD to create the pui-stage.infoimageinc.com system.


author: william.kong
comment: [~hkhosravani]: Can you re-test this? I believe the ISD pui-stage.infoimageinc.com is up now which mean I3socket.pl should be able to communicate. If it still doesn't work, please re-assign to me.

comment: [~William.Kong]My test is failing because RHS2 doesn't have papyrus authorization keys. keys are on rhs server now and ill need to wait for it to move back to rhs2.

comment: [~hkhosravani]: Please re-test this on rhs2{color:#de350b}*parallel environment*{color} before Friday? Please re-assign back to me with your results (good or bad).

comment: [~hkhosravani]: Thanks for completing this task. This is issue is related to ISD not having system setup. I've expedited the request and hopefully it will be done 'soon'. i'll keep this ticket assigned to me until they are ready with it.
