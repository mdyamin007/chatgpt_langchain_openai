We are not creating new accounts from etax process. Those warning accounts are not present in ISD database. That is why there were those warnings. Do we need to create new account from Etax process?

Please check Client's IRS data file and provide 10 error accounts for "Account#|Name" to [~mamunur.rashid] .
So he can check in production ISD database to make sure those account# are for correct member.

We need to review we are not posting to wrong member.

Thanks,

Tun

 As attached on Jira IS-1485, I obtained 5 accounts from the screenshot attached to this bug tracker ticket, BT-418, and is attached as: [^1098_accountNum_with_warning.txt]

Please check to see that thename and account numbers are matched in the production database

I checked the prod database and noticed that only the below two accounts are present there.

MARY O MARKOE => 1474850

MARY E EDINGER => 1478720

The other 3 accounts are not present in the production database.

We are past due on providing a sample to the client and they are asking for a new timeline. Any update on this item?

As previously mentioned, this issue that QA provided showed that there were errors with some account numbers when posting to stage. According to ISD, 3 of the 5 sample accounts I obtained from the screenshot provided in BT-418 are not present in the ISD database. Please confirm with the client that these sample accounts are the correct member numbers to use.

To be clear, these are just *sample* accounts not in the ISD database.

The sample accounts:
Member name   | Account # | Suffix
MARK LACHANCE  1474350  142
STEVEN CHARLES  1481200  144
DUANE A LITZAU  1485040  142

The client said these accounts are good to use.

A few sample accounts were taken from the error screenshot and provided to ISD. From those sample accounts that they couldn't find in the ISD database were confirmed with the client to be the correct members. Please let ISD know if they need to be added

[~Shun.Kuwashima]--Can you add these acct #


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~gthillaivel] Mamunur is the one assigned to the ISD story, please ask him for assistance.

[~Kbittmann] We would need to enable etax acct creation to post those accounts, do we want this temporarily just to post these etaxes onto stage or do we want this flag permanently for production as well? Keep in mind that if we do enable etax acct creation, the index file content must be correct or else we may end up posting to the wrong acct by mistake.

We can't add accounts manually in our DB. We need to create accounts from etax process.

[~TunA] Can you help on adding the accounts manually in DB


author: tuna
comment: Hey [~Shun.Kuwashima],

Can you help [~mamunur.rashid]to add new accounts to post. Client confirmed those new accounts are correct member.

I think you guys call "turn on account creation on stage"?



Thanks,

Tun


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~TunA] [~gthillaivel] Yes that's correct, etax account creation was not enabled on stage. I've enabled it and reposted the 1098 and 1099 jobs, the new accounts should be created now.

[~Kbittmann] I checked a few accounts from the files posted on stage and they don't exist on production either (e.g. 1473310, 1474350). As I asked previously, do we need to have etax account creation enabled on production as well? If so, then please let [~mamunur.rashid] know so that it's part of his release.

Do I need to re-post the index file "etax_1098_12312021_311_10042022_105627_nvcu.txt"  to verify the changes?


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~gthillaivel] No that's one of the files I reposted, you would probably need to release and approve the jobs on stage Job Status again in order to view them.

E-tax is posted successfully in stage for 1098 and 1099int
