comment: Hi [~Peter.Dang]

What is the font code for the font mentioned in description?


author: rony
comment: Hi [~William.Kong]

Do we have this *Montserrat* font installed? would you please provide me the font code.



Thanks


author: william.kong
comment: [~rony]: Not yet. Per Papyrus Support, they are still investigating the font issue. I think you were cc'd in the email.


author: kdishroon
comment: Hi [~rony] - Per the client, we can use the ariel font. Please proceed with working on the samples with Ariel font.


author: william.kong
comment: [~rony]: I've changed the status from "Blocked" to "In Progress" now that the major blocker of font issue has changed from Montserrat to now "Arial" font. Please use Arial outline font for this project.


author: rony
comment: Hi [~William.Kong]

Existing are already in Arial outline font.


author: rony
comment: Hi [~kdishroon] [~William.Kong]

Repeating, the existing letter is already using Arial outline font.


author: kdishroon
comment: Hi [~rony] and [~William.Kong]

The client is pushing back and insisting on the Montserrat font. However, can you please provide samples with the current font (Ariel) and the new logo?

Thank you,

Keri


author: rony
comment: Hi [~kdishroon]

So the new logo is for archival only per description?


author: rony
comment: Hi [~kdishroon]

So the new logo is for archival only?

And a total of 9 letters to change, right? I don't see letter 010(Turning 18) in production.


author: rony
comment: Hi [~kdishroon]

Please see my previous message and confirm.

Attached are some pdf samples with new font.

author: kdishroon
comment: HI [~rony],

I apologize for the delay, I did not see your question; the logo should be updated on the letter as well, not just archival:

Just to confirm this b/w logo will be used for paper , enotice and archival for hfcu daily?

author: rony
comment: Hi [~kdishroon]

Confirming again, will this b/w logo will be used for paper, enotice and archival? Or there is a color version of this logo. I don't see the color version logo here.


author: kdishroon
comment: Hi [~rony],

Yes, please use the b&w logo for paper, enotice and archival; this is what they currently have.

Thank you,

Keri




author: rony
comment: Hi [~kdishroon]

Any feedback on the provided sample.

Extremely sorry for misleading here.[^HFCUDLA-1.zip] . Here are the updated samples.




author: rony
comment: Hi [~kdishroon]

You got the updated sample, right? Let me know.


author: kdishroon
comment: Hi [~rony],

Yes, thank you! Here is the client's feedback with my notes in red:

We received the Daily Notices samples with our black logo this morning. Our teams reviewed and the black logo looks good.

On letters 6, 7, & 8, the date is placed below our return address. Can the placement of the date on these letters be changed to match letters 1  5? {color:#de350b}- I am assuming this would need to be on a separate ticket; please confirm.{color}

Also, a date did not map for letter 9 (W8 letter). Will the date map in correctly on our production W8 letters? -{color:#de350b} Again, I am assuming this would need to be a separate ticket; please confirm.{color}

{color:#172b4d}Thank you,{color}

{color:#172b4d}Keri{color}




author: rony
comment: Hi [~kdishroon]

Here are the updated samples.

[^HFCUDL009.pdf][^HFCUDL008.pdf][^HFCUDL007.pdf][^HFCUDL006.pdf]

Yes, the date will appear on our production w8 letters.

No need for separate ts. Updates are done.



Thanks


author: kdishroon
comment: Hi [~rony],

DL letter samples were approved; can you please provide the DPVS so I can request print samples? Also, can you please work with [~abdullah.baki] on ISD-6469 to get samples uploaded to InfoTRAC pilot?

author: kdishroon
comment: [~William.Kong]/ [~rony],

Has this gone through QA yet?


author: igor.khosid
comment: [~rony] [~kdishroon]
The print samples were provided only for the letters ## 8 and 9 ( see above attached). Please give the print file to include the pieces for all letters


author: rony
comment: Hi [~Igor.Khosid]

I don't have a data file that includes all the letters. The changes were mainly to use MT font and a new logo and I am assuring you I added those to all the letters as you can see in the approved samples. So testing one or two letters just to see font and logo looks ok will be enough.



Thanks


author: kdishroon
comment: [~Igor.Khosid],

Please proceed with QA with the letters you have; we can't hold this up any longer, the client escalated the Daily Letters to go-live ASAP.

Here is the client's response:



*We have attached updated copies of both our TIS Disclosure and TIS Disclosure Share Certificates to this email.*

*We believe both of these need to be updated as they are included as inserts for the following notices:*
 * *Turning 18  Needs to include the TIS Disclosure*
 * *Certificate Maturity Notice (Auto Renew at Maturity)  Needs to include the TIS Disclosure Share Certificates*

That's how the client provided the disclosure.

I don't have any record of where I was asked to release this task but looks like this task is in production.

So should I go for adding the new disclosure?

Rony


author: kdishroon
comment: Hi [~rony],

Production asked in ticket 29263 that the disclosure be updated to print in only black and white so yes, please update the disclosure.

Thank you!

author: rony
comment: Hi [~kdishroon]

So it will be b/w for print and color for rest? Or b/w for all print/enotice/archival ?

Thanks

comment: Hi [~kdishroon]

Although the disclosure pdf is standard size 8.5*11 inch but it is in portrait mode. Below are the difference between what we are currently displaying and the new disclosure:



!image-2022-06-30-18-33-32-871.png!

Does the change to Landscape make it 2 pages, or is the current version also 2 pages?


author: rony
comment: Hi [~kdishroon]

Please check the current version sample for 006[^HFCUDL006-2.pdf]

The disclosure client provided has 2 pages but the orientation is not the same as the current sample.

comment: Hi [~kdishroon]

From my coding perspective it's same as previous. This is horizontally 11 inch and vertically 8.5 inch right? Which is the opposite directory of the paper used for printing. So in the output it would be like below which ishorizontally 8.5 inch and vertically 11 inch .

Anyway please give me the tiff version .
