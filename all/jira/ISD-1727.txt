Please see the attached wiki page for context.

In short, there is a version issue with Meteor. Meteor 1.9.0's node package needs a certain version of GNU C Library. Some of our hypercube servers is using a version of the Ubuntu OS that does not have the appropriate libraries. I have figured out how to resolve this by targeting version 1.2.1.

However, for some reason, in the /home/meteor/.meteor/packages/meteor-tool folder, the 1.9.0 folder and its symbolic is still created. I think it was created when I start hypercube for the first time. Please research into how this gets created and if there is a way to prevent this. This 1.9.0 folder is the reason why the issue occurs.

Hi [~tai.trinh],
h3. @isd



I did some research regarding this problem. If we install meteor using the command :
"*curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh*",it install the latest release versionsalong with 1.1.10 but when we run hypercube then it runs on version 1.2.1 which is defined in *.meteor/local/release* file.

At thisscenario, */.meteor/packages/meteor-tool*this directory contains both 1.1.10 and 1.9.0 release versions folder.

I tried to delete 1.9,0 folder and run hypercube butmeteor executable could not startthat implies meteor is installed as version 1.9. Then i uninstall meteor by deleting .meteor folder and run the meteor installation command as bellow to target the meteor version 1.2.1,

"*curlhttps://install.meteor.com/?release=1.2.1| sh*"

Once theinstallation of meteor release version 1.2.1 is complete. At thisscenario, */.meteor/packages/meteor-tool*this directory contains only 1.1.10 release version folder.

Also after run the hypercube using "*meteor --settings settings.json*" command, there was no change in*/.meteor/packages/meteor-tool* directory.It still contains only 1.1.10 release version folder and runs properly.

Another thing i notice in this scenario that , when we run "*meteor --version*"command in version 1.2.1 then it automaticallystarts updating meteor-tools of version 1.9.0.

*Possible Solution :*

You can try deleting the .meteor folder and again install release version 1.2.1 using this command : "*curlhttps://install.meteor.com/?release=1.2.1| sh*". This should solve the problem as it works fine for me. I did not face the scenario like having both release version folder in*/.meteor/packages/meteor-tool* directory after install release version 1.2.1 or run hypercube for the first time.

If this still occur then *METEOR_NO_RELEASE_CHECK*environment variable can be used for that while ruining hypercube.So if we run hypercube like this: "*METEOR_NO_RELEASE_CHECK=1 meteor --settings settings.json*"it shouldn't update any packages or meteor releases. It disables thebackground release updates by invoking*METEOR_NO_RELEASE_CHECK=1*accordingtoMeteor API Docs but it is available fromv1.4.1, 2016-08-18. So, you can downgrade the meteor version from 1.9.0 and run hypercube using thisenvironment variable.

I think these information will help preventing your problem. Let me know if any other information is needed.

Thank You.
