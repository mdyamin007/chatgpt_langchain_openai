comment: [~hesham.hanna]: Please re-assign back to me when done; Since this is development box, you can start clone at anytime. You don't need to inform anyone when to start cloning.

comment: [~hesham.hanna]: Can you also look at this box as well:

hostname -i not mapping to the correct address

!image-2020-03-19-14-49-25-187.png!





Also ping ca-isis-ds-01 is not resolving to the IP address of 10.4.18.38
