title: RWCU - [25500][pvt][in-house] DP - RWCU Daily PDF Letter RedTitan error
description: We encountered RedTitan (ca-rtitan-pr-04 ) errors for today's cycle; please look into this and advise. File has been

processed successfully after a few reprocessing.



Error messages received:

RWCU DNA, ERROR: in redtitan convert step

rwcudn401red Error : RedTitan PDF Image Count vs AFP Image Count Does Not Match.

There was an error while verify the total number of PDF pages vs the total number of AFP pages.



Expected PDF page count is: 183

Retutned AFP page count is: 52



The AFP file is located at /d/daily/rwcudna/rwcudn401red.afp.

Please contact the IS Department to research why there is a discrepancy.





File ran successfully after several re-tries, error is mainly due to 'memory' issue on the RedTitan server; DP just wanted

to open a ticket as this happening quite a lot lately, for IS Team to find a final solution to resolve this 'memory' issue.



TS#25112 is also a RedTitan server ( ca-rtitan-pr-01) issue



------------------per Andy--------------------------------

For out of memory issue in ca-rtitan-pr-01, we will track it in TS 25112 (William)



For this job RWCU PDF, if you see it it is still frequently failing with the same memory issue, please ask AC to file a Jira ticket. I can move this job toca-rtitan-pr-03
