comment: Kent,

The team confirmed that they were able to access except for me. I am able to access Prod database but not the dev one. Can you help double check.

Thanks

comment: @Dave- Can you SSH to this machine from a dev machine for now....This requires a temp rule which is more work then its worth. Thanks
