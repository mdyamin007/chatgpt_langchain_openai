title: WHCU [33864] [pvt] Bug Fix for WHCU Statement / Email Posting
description: This is a bug. There were 2 updates we were working on parallell, 2 different developers. One is the migration IS-1162 and another is pdfi to afp2web 64 bit conversion IS-1215.



The migration is-1162 got released earlier but when the 64 bit conversion got release the migration code got replaced. Now I need bring back the migration code to the latest pdfi to afp2web release.



Rony will turn over to QA.

Hi[~Igor.Khosid]

Parallel id:20220922164244

This is a release issue whenIS-1215got releasedIS-1162 code that was released earlier accidentally got replaced, we didn't merge the code.

Now I brought back the IS-1162 code to production so now the parallel code has both Jira updates.



I ran in parallel already to test both Jira updates.

/z/isd_input_dev/I3/process-files/whcu/ds1_20220921_1_20220922_1700_whcu.txt is the ISD index.

And/z/pdf_afp/whcu/whcuds1/zip is the archival output.



I strongly believe you don't need to go for posting the ISD index, just taking a look is enough. I just brought back the previous version code of production to the latest version, didn't write any new code.



Thanks
