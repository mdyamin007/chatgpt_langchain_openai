Below is the client's feedback; shouldn't we be able to see the new tab in InfoTRAC pilot?



Hi Keri, not sure if I'm doing something wrong but I randomly picked a few accounts which had Visa Annual Statements and none of them came up in the pilot site.

Acct:

*344625*

Hi Keri, there was an issue on my end, that should be fixed now. Can you tell the client to check again on InfoTRAC pilot? Thanks.

Hi Keri,

It should be 12/31/2019. My apologies as I set the date to 9/30/2019 to confirm the document showed up up under the new tab during testing, but the date is corrected now.

The client is asking"Can the new 'Visa Annual' tab be moved next to the 'Visa' tab?"

Let me know if this is possible.

Thank you,

Keri

Hi Keri,

For the Account Management in InfoTRAC, they are using Account Management V1 and the reordering of tabs isn't supported. We will also not be making any changes to the V1 as we have an Account Management V2 where the reordering of tabs do work.
