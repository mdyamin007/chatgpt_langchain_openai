title: Missing working folder for Redtitan
description: Missing working folder for Redtitan jobs.

Working folder was mount as:

/d/Iswk_new on Linux server

D: drive on Redtitan server



Currently on 10.4.20.40 rhs2, it was empty and not mounted.

For 10.4.20.34 rh2, it was mounted to D drive but it did not have all the working sub-directories.

Here is the current sub-directories in Menlo production servers.

comment: [~andyp]: I've fixed rhs2 mounting issue. Please try again now. Please note, the there are no folders right now so you will need to create the folders manually. There's only 199GB of "temporary" storage on D:\. 



Network Dept is working on getting the Isilon server setup.



Please confirm if this works or not. If not, please re-assign back to me.

comment: I saw the Iswk_new mount drive from rhs2

[oper1@rhs2 Iswk_new]$ pwd
/d/Iswk_new
[oper1@rhs2 Iswk_new]$ ls -l
total 4
drwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Sep 2 2020 k
drwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Mar 6 18:07 New Folder
drwxrwxrwx 1 root root 4096 Aug 14 13:20 $RECYCLE.BIN
drwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Aug 14 12:50 System Volume Information
drwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Sep 1 13:28 test



which is the same mount drive from rh2.

This drive is from D drive of Redtitan server.

So the mount configuration is correct.

I already manually created folder test/cambdl401 for testing purpose.



Will: could you copy all directory structure from production Redtitan D drive to this Brisbane Redtitan D drive. We need this one time. No daily sync is needed.

Since other tests will fail if we don't have this working directory structure. Program will not create these folders on the fly. This is intentional so that program will not create bogus folder if it is passed with the wrong arguments (program will error out in this case). These folder would be created one time during initial setup.

comment: [~andyp]: I'm creating the 'blank' directory structure right now... It's still running right now. I will re-assign this ticket to you after I am done.

comment: [~andyp]: the blank directory has been created. Please check in a few minutes. Hesham and I need to reboot the brisbane rhs2 server for a different issue.


author: andyp
comment: I saw the blank working directories were created correctly. I also saw it was mounted on both Brisbane rh2 and rhs2.



So Redtitan testing should be good to continue.
