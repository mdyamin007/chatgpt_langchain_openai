Hello, client said there were some additional verbiage changes on their edit.

1. Removal of the verbiage "Please deduct the total fees charged from your balance. "

2. Changing first line of 2nd paragraph verbiage to "If the reason for the returned unpaid item was due to insufficient funds in your account, you may wish to consider applying for an overdraft line of credit. "

Thank you!
