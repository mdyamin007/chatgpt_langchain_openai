DP Requested Tax enhancement

Hours for development: 7 (IS hours) + ISD hours required
Turnover Date : 09/14/2021
1st Sample to QA: 10/21/2021
Sample Approval Date: 10/26/2021
Go live date : 10/29/2021

Assessment Details (IS):
- Parallel required: No (but need to test with DP for processing speed)

- The DFA uses 3 cross-reference files. 1 of them is already using searchfirst() and the other 2 aren't. The slow processing speed should be from this array called &ESUP_ACCT_ARR. There are over 26000 entries and it loops every time for each account #. Using searchfirst() will reduce processing time.

- Steps to update:

&ESUP_ACCT_ARR :

In BEFOREDOC, construct the array with elements for cross ref requirement.
Switch to use searchfirst() to check if there is match.
