title: TKCU:  Daily Notices:  PDF Archival Add Cleanup Logic (In-house)
description: Parallel Required: Yes (Run Paper, eStmt & PDF) to make sure all service perform without issues.



Please review the /home/master/tkcu_dl_process.sh shell script. There is a bug where the program does not clear the /d/pdf_afp/tkcu/tkcudla folder+before+ beginning the PDF archival program.

First I want to mention that These tkcu statement and daily notice scripts are very confusing specially the archival part.

I could not create pdf using pdfi option. I tried the following command:


_${home_master}/master/isisdisk.sh tkcudla pdfi /z/daily/tkcu/tkcudl038.dat format_


This give the following output:

_processing formatting step for straight pdfi generation..._
_/z/daily/tkcu/tkcudl038.dat_
_cleaning up /z/pdf_afp/tkcu/tkcudla/pdf/..._

_generating individual pdf files into /z/pdf_afp/tkcu/tkcudla/pdf/_

_----------------------------_



This does not give any error but does not create any pdf either. It creates _/z/daily/tkcu/tkcudla_pdfi.afp_but I am not sure how it suppose to create the pdf and why it doesn't. I tried it in RHS, RHS2 and RH2 environment.

I need help to find out why PDFI option is not creating any pdf.



Thanks,

Rahat

comment: [~amirR]: I haven't found time to review with my team on this one processing question. Please continue with the other projects in the mean time as I would like to get this rolled out before we run out of disk space in our servers during tax season.



Thanks!

comment: [~amirR]: I am able to reproduce this issue as well. I'm going to see if [~jira_naru]can spare some time to see why it does not work in parallel under rh2.



[~jira_naru]: This the test file I used. Just need to see why PDFi does not create files under parallel.
