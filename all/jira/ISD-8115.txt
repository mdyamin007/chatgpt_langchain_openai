title: [35476] - TFSL - InfoTrac Name Update [pvt]
description: per Shun:

Since the index file postings (or meta file as you may call it) updates the account owner name in our database, we may not need to do this manually. However if the client still wants to proceed, this would usually be billable for 2 hours. 

 

Tentative timeline:

Turnover: 11/9

Live: 11/11
