comment: Hi Rony,

Customer responded to sample:

The only issue I noticed with the letter is the formatting on the withholding percentage sentence. Currently the letter reads as follows: "backup withholding (%30)". Can we change that so that it reads (30%)?

comment: Hi [~billr]

This is coming from data file.
