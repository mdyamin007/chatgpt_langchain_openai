title: BANB - CD Commercial Report Automation for Accounting Dept In-Hse
description: Update Processing logic to automatically place the Commercial CD reporting to the \\dell-2100\Accounting Reports\commercial_cd_reports\$cid folder
 * Program will automatically create the cid folder if it does not exist in \\dell-2100\Accounting Reports\commercial_cd_reports\ folder
 * Update the logic to also copy the cid_MMDDYYYY_HHMM_DPVS.txt report to the commercial_cd_reports\$cid\ subdirectory
 * Update processing script to not use preprocessing02/03 /home/afp2web/script/COMMERCIAL_CD.prod.pl script, but start using /home/master/COMMERCIAL_CD.prod.pl script instead
 * Remove COMMERCIAL_CD_TEST2.pl logic. It's the same as COMMERCIAL_CD.prod.pl script with the difference in email notification recipient distribution logic. Instead, use global email script and introduce maillist_commercial_cd email distribution list maillist_commercial_cd so it can be used differently between prod and test
 * Remove hardcoded email address in script


Miscellaneous Logic Updates:
 * Fix indentation & remove unused variables & commented codes
 * Fix logic to create log directories automatically for new installation of new CIDs so that developer does not create folders manually during setup
 * Update banb & eqbk processing script to check for missing CD Master List that is required for Commercial CDs. If it is missing, program should break prior to re-running
 * Update func_set4.sh global script to improve STDOUT messaging to print the file names the script can not locate vs just complaining file is missing; It will help developer trouble if issue arises in the future
