Here is the client's feedback:

"Reduce logo size 10-15% and add space between bottom of logo and top of address. Ideal is 1 "x" height of "Westerra" safe space around logo."

Please let me know if you can resize the logo per the client's request.

To clarify on 1 "x" height of "Westerra" safe space around logo; there should be the same amount of white space around all 4 sides of the logo. Attached is the style guide if needed. [^REB21-055_WCU_BrandStyleguide_V1.1_EXTERNAL (1).pdf]
