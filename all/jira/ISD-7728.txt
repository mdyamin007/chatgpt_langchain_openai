title: FCBT[pvt][30831]: Enable automated advanced online proofing for print/electronic
description: As a permanent solution for L3 30831, configure setting up AOLP for electronic for the below CID's/Applications;

CID's:
CAFC
CTFC
FCBA
ALFC
MILB

Enable electronic AOLP as well for ALL of their LIQ applications:

LIQ Simple Bills
LIQ Simple Statements
LIQ Complex Bills
LIQ Complex Statements
Funds Held
Daily Notices

This will allow for the auto-posting needed to fully automate for these associations to eliminate the manual posting needed on the DP side once print samples are approved.

Note that this should ONLY be done for the above CID's. All other CID's (aside from PLBA which doesn't have AOLP) still have bills generated from their other core.

Enabling/Automation should be for the following:

Print AOLP
Electronic AOLP
Auto-posting
Auto-email trigger

ADDING ISD Assessment from ticket:
We can do auto-email and electronic AOLP without any splitting of application group. Estimate is 8 Hrs for this update. Timeline can follow IS.

comment: [~phoebe.george] [~Ricky Lopez] We've gone over this in past tickets but just a reminder, some of their LIQ apps share the same tab (aka same statement type) as their monthly, patronage checks, and prefix ol1(forgot what this app is called). Below is our configurations showing this, see the prefixes sharing the 'default' type:

global.ms1=default -- Monthly
global.ol1=default -- ??
global.ck1=default -- Patronage Checks
global.lq3=default -- LIQ Complex Statements
global.ls1=default -- LIQ Simple Bills
global.lq1=billing -- LIQ Simple Statements
global.lq2=billing -- LIQ Complex Bills
global.ml1=mortgage -- Funds Held
global.dla=enotice -- Daily Notices

Therefore, AOLP would be required for the non-LIQ apps as well. Please confirm you are aware of this, if so then I can work on setting the configurations on lower environments.

comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] - All 5 CID for ls1 (LIQ Simple Stmts) are posted on both pilot and stage. In Pilot, CTFC is posted as Tax 1099-q. Can you please check? The index file is: ls1_20220731_1_20220919_1034_ctfc.txt

Thanks!

comment: [~rukmaniR] I'm holding off until further confirmation from [~phoebe.george] since this update does affect a few non-LIQ apps.
