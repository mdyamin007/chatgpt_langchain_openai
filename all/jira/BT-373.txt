comment: [~gthillaivel] - I don't think IRA has estatements. 
[~Kbittmann] - Please advise if 1098 has estatements. The procs file says no but looks like estatements were processed last cycle for the very first time in the ran file. I had to write a new script for this app and will need to update it if so.
