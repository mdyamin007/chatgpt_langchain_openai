There was no invalid address on the data files provided. So we made one with custom data..

Thanks,

comment: Fahad, 
TXOPS reported they do not see any print files for proc id 699886, please check.

Diego,
The client could not find the invalid address report in the client pick up, can you please move it there and reply to the client's email once done?

I think the proc id is wrong or I might just reran by mistake and the print file got overwritten.
 Here is the updated dpvs attached.

Hi Fahad,
 # What did you use for the anchor?
 # Do you have data with more records?


author: andreav
comment: Fahad, not sure if you saw my email but Calvin Choy reported that the dpvs is from a 9/1 process and they no longer have that file in their system. Can you please check if you provided the correct recent dpvs?

Index file naming doesn't match SOW. Please see below
 As per SOW 
 *ufcu_EA_Index_mmddyyyy.txt*
 Actual
 *ufcuea1_index.txt*


author: igor.khosid
comment: [~diegof] [~fahad] [~andreav]

Diego - thank you for your help

Fahad - please disregard my previous comments - index file naming - is correct "*ufcu_EA_Index_mmddyyyy.txt" >>>ufcu_EA_Index_08262021.txt*
