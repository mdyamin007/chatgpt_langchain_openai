what is the invalid address file naming? Did you add in the sow? If we need to encrypt the report then we also need pgp key for this.

Thanks

File naming should be as follows.

SUCU_STMT_invalid_mail_address_<mmddyy>_<seg#>.csv.pgp

SUCU_NOTICES_invalid_mail_address_<mmddyy>_<seg#>.csv.pgp

I have attached the updated SOWs as well.[^SUCU Daily Notices  SOW 06.25.12.doc][^SUCU Print Monthly statements SOW.doc]

since we need to encrypt the report we will need PGP key. If you are not sure, would you please talk to Stephen or Peter about it?

Are one of you able to assist with the PGP key that Rony is requesting?


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~rony] SUCU doesn't use PGP key, please copy the report "as is" for client pickup for the setup.

Below are the invalid address reports. Those are generated from fake data.

[^sucu_notice_invalid_mail_address_01192022_1.csv]

[^sucu_stmt_invalid_mail_address_03162022_1.csv]

I also forwarded you the emails for invalid addresses. subjects are:

SUCU Monthly Statement Invalid Address File Ready for Retrieval
 SUCU Notice Invalid Address File Ready for Retrieval


 Thanks

Any feedback?

Please see questions from client below.



I completed my review and here are my comments. Thank you
 # Can we change the account number column to state Member Number since that is not the account number? It will be confusing to staff.
 # Can we add the complete address on one line? It is confusing the way it is displaying backwards with the street number after the street name.
 # The first report showed all the information but started on line 9 with blanks before it and the second report had an incomplete address. Can we get a sample that is better formatted? It does not look great right now.
 # The application type column is there but there is no data in it.
 # Can we add the reason why it is invalid?
 # Will this be running once a day? If so, can you provide the timing each day?

We generated the sample from our modified data. Would you please refer to us a cycle for each app to process.

For point 5 -Can we add the reason why it is invalid? - No, we don't do that

For point 6 -Will this be running once a day? If so, can you provide the timing each day? - whenever we process a cycle if it contains invalid address , this report will be generated. There is no separate process just for invalid address report generation.

I also forwarded you the email for the invalid address report. Subject: "SUCU Monthly Statement Invalid Address File Ready for Retrieval [TEST ENVIRONMENT]"

Need to release this again. We accidentally didn't copy(commented out the code) the invalid address report in client pickup.
