BANB wants to know if we can also suppress the escrow shortage information in paragraph one and two on page 2 within the notice? Please advise.

We can only suppress that verbiage if it is unique to that notice and also if it is unique to that part of the statement and only occurs on page 2. I did some research and it seems like it is unique enough however it would be great if client can also confirm the uniqueness of the verbiage.

Also, if we conclude that verbiage is unique and can be suppressed, we will need to re-evaluate work order since this out of the scope of the original work order. We will also need to do a parallel test since we are dealing with print image format.

I will have to get a new release date from Peter since client took so long to approve.

However, before release, we will need to do a parallel for this since the scope of work changed and we had to suppress verbiage.
