THe samples - ready for the client review

Please, request the print samples - after client approval


author: dyuen
comment: Samples forwarded to client for review/approval.

[~jharvey], FYI


author: dyuen
comment: [~rukmaniR],

Please see below questions from GCBK:
 # If the font in the top paragraph different than the others?
 # Does there need to be that much space between the name/address and the notice? If you do that for folding, it is fine.
 # And it will have the enclosure [insert]with it right?

These were my initial responses, but I would like you to confirm:
 # The font should be the same.
 # I believe we can move up the body of the letter since the other daily letters don't have that much spacing.
 # Yes, the insert is just not included with these samples.

Please confirm and provide an updated sample with less spacing between the address block and body of the letter.

Thanks!

1. The font is the same for the whole body of the letter.
2. Moved up the body of the letter and attached the new sample. - gcbkdm01.is_new.pdf
3. Insert will be added later.

Thanks!

Sounds like the form # - incorrect should be GC-1(R 03/17) instead of  (GC-1(R 02/18) as on the actual print samples
