While we are still waiting for the bigger test file from the client, do you have any questions about this project?

Also I have confirmed that the maximum number of recipient's address lines are going to be 4.

Thank you,

We had a status call with the client today and there is a question from them about 2 different names for the zip file, whether they can use something else as the identifiers for English and Spanish letters? As [~diegof] mentioned on our turnover call, he recommends the client to use the different files names (as per SOW) to be able to add the English or Spanish Medical form accordingly, but it is hard to fulfill this requirement for the client.

Could you please advise?

Thank you!

If client is not able to name it accordingly, I think we can capture the words from the pdf to differentiate the letter, but I will need to test it first. I will get back to you as soon as the testing is done ;however, please make sure client keep the format and word position constant when they send the file in the future. 

Thanks,
Tevis

Client has uploaded a larger test file to the test FTP folder:

Could you please confirm the receipt?

Thank you!

There is one more question:

During our TO call [~diegof] mentioned that client has to follow with 2 file names for English and Spanish version in order for us to identify which Medical Form to attach to which file (pp 2-4 of the Letter). This requirement is difficult to fulfill for the client.

Client is asking if they can add the application Medical forms to the letters themselves before sending to us, so that the files doesn't have to be separated by English and Spanish files?

Thank you!

Data has been received under /d/ftpbu/ccmcbu/test folder. 

It will be great that if the client can include the forms with the letters in a same pdf.

Thanks,
Tevis

Do you think we need to request from the client an updated test file combining letters with the forms accordingly within one pdf? Or whatever we have from them at this moment is enough for you now?

Thank you,

I will be updating the project's timeline for settling the QA new dates, can you please confirm the new coding dates first? When can we expect the first sample?

Thank you!

I'm working on it now and I will need more time for setting up the script to test on stage. However, I can generate the pdf sample for you to review by this week, but I will need the client to provide the logo in 300dpi so I can add it on the sample.  

Thanks,
Tevis

comment: [~Tevis Mak] the client has passed over ccmc_dl_10272022_1.zip.gpg to /d/ftpbu/ccmcbu/test/ folder. 

This should be a good test file going forward.

 _Why doesn't the header look like my sample? Can you make it look like it below?_

Per our turn over meeting, the logo will be removed and replaced with logo that fit the left top window of the envelope.

Thanks,
Tevis

OPS confirmed that the company name does not need to be part of the return address.
So we can keep client's design that they initially wanted by positioning the return address to show through the window of the envelope #10 and keeping the larger logo in the middle.
Can you please revise the sample accordingly?

Thank you!

I just process CCMC with the datafiles ccmc_dl_10272022_1.zip.pgp on our test environment and there are some issue with the address. We are using USPS software to sort the address. However, the address in the pdf file are invalid which prevent the program process successfully. We will need valid address from the pdf to pass the USPS software in order to generate output from test environment. Also, I notices some of the pdf files are named in LTR_POC_XXXXX and LTR_SUP_XXXXX, but I checked it's the same format letter. Do you know what is the difference? If there is no difference, it's better to name it in a same pattern. 

Also, there are letter with different format inside the data folder. Does the client want to include this letter as well? I attached the screenshot below.

Can you please advise?
