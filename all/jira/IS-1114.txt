2 hrs - Convert PDF disclosure to PSEG and update 2 DFA's to use new disclosure. Same PSEG is used for both paper and e-notice. ISD will need to upload new resource. Same PSEG is also used for both DFA's (ACBKDL032 & ACBKDL033). (1 hr to convert PDF to PSEG + 1/2 hr to update DL032 + 1/2 hr to update DL033 = 2 hrs)



1 hr - Testing



1 hr - ISD Update resource.
