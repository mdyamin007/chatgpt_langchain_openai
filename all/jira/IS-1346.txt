comment: [~berezinez] - Please review and confirm the samples are ready for the client's review.
I believe IS-1345 - will be in QA today (08.26) or Tuesday (08.03)


[~MattL]
1. Please attach updated SOW 
2. I'm not sure when the samples are due date. 
QA received the story late *{color:red}08.25.2022 06:25 PM{color}*. 
If this is today 08.26 -  please submit, and we can review them in parallel with the client.

I'd prefer to send samples of IS-1345 & IS-1346 together. It's looking like IS-1345 will not be ready until Tuesday 8/30

EPCUDL001 hasn't been updated:

!image-2022-09-01-18-24-27-709.png!


author: thomasy
comment: [~MattL]I checked and that letter is print using image meaning all the content is coming from the data. All of that will need to be updated on their end. If they want samples for this letter they'll have to provide test data.

comment: Hi [~thomasY],

On notice#19, please change "officer" to "Department".

On notice#42, the "2. IRA Share Certificate - Moved to IRA Plan" line is still showing above the greeting line "Dear Member FUll Name". Please remove that.
