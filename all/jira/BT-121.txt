comment: [~gthillaivel] On infotrac the message 'eStmt job was not tracked.' is due to estatement tracking not being enabled. PC needs to assist with that.
[~dyuen] Can you ask PC to enable estatement tracking for this dtjobid 133796-C01.01-V21937 on stage? Once that's done, it should be good after reposting the index file.

comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima], sure thing. I requested PC to turn it on in the ticket. Pending their response/confirmation.
