comment: [~Tasneem]-Do you have a possible sample date for this application?


author: mousumis
comment: Hi [~Ricky Lopez]
We can provide on 12th Sept. 


author: mousumis
comment: Hi [~Ricky Lopez] can you provide the logo? 
And should we use b/w for paper? 


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~Ricky Lopez] Please confirm with COLU if the notices should print in b/w or color like the consumer statements.

[~mousumiS] You can use the same logo as the MS1, but need to confirm if it should be color or b/w based on as soon as COLU responds.

Let me know if you can pull the same logo/return address as the ms1 application for statements.

Thanks!


author: JIRAUSER11400
comment: [~mousumiS]-Client confirmed these can be b/w


author: JIRAUSER11400

comment: [~kericapote] Disregard this.

[~mousumiS] The same return address needs to be added to the logo for the notices as used for monthly statements; highlighted below. Please be sure to shrink logo enough to be able to display the address through the house #10 dbl window envelope. Thanks!

The fixed sample is attached here. Now, we have used width 2.020 inches
height 0.970 inch as same as monthly. Is it enough to see through dbl window? Please suggest. 

Thanks

[~terrencet] are you able to confirm why the font is not defined/missing. Would you be able to assist to resolve, or let me know which IS programmer I should tag?

comment: Ricky,

I discussed with Anwar. Anwar will track down the program to change the AFP to use outline font instead. COLU cold storage require the PDF to use True Type font. When the AFP is using outline font, during the AFP2PDF conversion it will automatically use True type font. Else mapping from raster font to True Type font is require.

Is there an update on the new set of samples? There is an open bug - the tap test failed.


author: igor.khosid
comment: [~Ricky Lopez] [~mousumiS]
Please do not submit or create any new MPT - if there is an open not fixed bug

[~berezinez] - FYI

comment: Hi, [~berezinez]



I think you are testing it with a scanned copy of this document, which would not give you the correct output.

Can you please try with the pdf attached below?

[^coludla1014.2o1.pdf]



Thanks.


author: igor.khosid
comment: [~infoimage]
Still trying to figure out to whom I'm replying too. Yes - with the latest pdf file, looks better. 
The only I would move to the left is just the endorsement verbiage about 7/16". see - attached
and BTW -  the scan copies have always done from the actual copy and so far we never had any issues

comment: [~berezinez]We are updating the logo to be consistent with Loan Statement application, which passed the tap test a few months back. I will need to have sample re-approved. Once done I will attach to story.


author: berezinez
comment: [~Ricky Lopez] [~Tasneem]

I verified the tap test using the print file provided yesterday
 # all the way to the right - part of the left side of the logo "the trees" are covered by the envelope
 # all the way to the left - partial endorsement type is covered.

do you need to inform the client? and are you going to fix it?

The endorsement issue needs to be fixed and fit the inside envelope. based on the USPS requirements.


author: JIRAUSER11400
comment: [~Tasneem] [~mousumiS]- can the endorsement line be moved over 7/16", as Igor suggested? !Tap test 11072022.png|width=417,height=196!
