title: SOW: incorrect envelope assignment
description: Envelope 5627 is assigned as Envelope 1 and 2 in SOW (8.0).

However, that is a non-permit envelope and is only allowed to be used as Envelope 3.

For Envelope 1 and 2, we must use envelopes with permit like, for example, 5624.

comment: Update as per meeting 09/23. The envelope used will be mostly hvy one, but the question is open if envelopes 1-3 will be used if the number of pages is low.
