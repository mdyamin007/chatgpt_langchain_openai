comment: Hi [~jira_naru] can you advise why this says waiting for approval? Samples are not due until 7/13


author: jira_naru
comment: I am not sure, 'Waiting for approval' is how came to me when was assigned. I think it should be 'In progress'

comment: Hi Nar client is requesting that we update "joviafinancial.com/locations" to our new domain "jovia.org/locations".






author: mattl
comment: [~jira_naru]Client also would like to know;



Will this be it's own job type? Can we approve before autoreleasing these to our members to have a chance to validate them?

comment: Matt:

Revised sample attached,

[^IS-189_necudl002_sample_071420210237.pdf]

This letter is part of the daily application. So, this letter 002, will run along with the other letters that we received for the daily application process.

I belive you can request OPTs to hold the job so that you can audit sample before releasing. Check with OPTs

comment: Hi,

Per the client:

*yes these are approved* with the two changes below, the date in the upper right and the location url pointing to jovia.org.

When this goes live, we also want daily notices to be moved back to manual approval so we can look at these for a few runs before putting back on automatic approvals
