for ASFC email address is mandatory as they do not have SMS as their Notification preference type, SMS is only available to get MFA. So, Is it safe to assume that *ASFC will always provide Email in their index file and they will provide SMS as an optional field in the index file*? cause if they don't provide email in ecl and from front end we ignore email (as doesn't exist in the file so won't let the user enoll) user won't be able to enroll ever. if we bypass that and let the user enroll with just matching the SMS number(assuming that only SMS was provided from the index file) we will run into an ambiguous situation as user can't update their email from profile page so they will never have an email address and thus won't get email notification . also our previous MFA logic was implemented based on this business that, there will always be an email. these are the corner cases, let me know your thoughts on this.

Thanks,

This ECL part is ready right? ALCU also need this update. Can you commit into pilot trunk for me to review?

Thanks,

Coding is done. I will pass it to testing tomorrow and commit it to trunk as soon as it's done. The change was made global so I will ask QA to test for ALCU as well along with ASFC.

also, Do we have a deadline for the ALCU ECL process Update?

Thanks,
