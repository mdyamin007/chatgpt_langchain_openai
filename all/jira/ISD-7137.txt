title: GCBK - [29084][pvt] Switch accounts to Paper
description: Set up a Revert to Paper process for GCBK



#2: We have a Revert to Paper process which can take in an account list (similar to what they provided but probably with a couple tweaks) and switch those to paper. If we do set this up, then they can also utilize this for future similar requests. If GCBK is interested in this approach, we can have someone assess the work for it.



Approval Needed By: 5/25

Pilot Date: 5/27

Approval Date: 5/30 (If this date was missed, the next live date will be the following Monday due to month-end processing)

Target Live Date: 5/31

It is ready on pilot. If they want to confirm if this works. They can send a file containing the account numbers with it's account type they wish to revert to paper. I provided an example which contains accounts from pilot.

comment: [~mac], new file sent. Per GCBK, this file has actual accounts so it should work.

Hi Daphne,

So, these accounts weren't processed as they didn't exist in our pilot database which is fine, they exist in production. "3469970,3469988,3470069,3475928,3475936,3475944,3475977,3475985".

However, the rest of the accounts in the file were all reverted to paper.

First, I manually set the accounts to paperless as they all were on paper. Then, after running the process, they were reverted back to paper.

Please ask the client to validate on pilot.


Thanks,

Mac

Thanks

Hi Daphne, QA is complete.

Is this request where they will send us a revert to paper file at anytime on some sort of regularly basis and we automatically process it, or is this something where they will open a ticket to request us to process a revert to paper file they are going to send?

Thanks,

Mac

comment: [~mac], GCBK said they will open a ticket to request us to process a revert to paper file. Please confirm once code has been released.

Hi Daphne,

The code is released. They can go and make that request for us to process a revert to paper file to verify if everything is working as intended.
