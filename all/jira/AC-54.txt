title: CFCU - test Jira Temporary Logo Change for all statements.
description: Per client: we need to update the logo on all statements and anything else it may be on. Effective 7/1/21 we can no longer use "Federal Credit Union" and will replace it with the attached logo until further notice. I included a color and black and white version.
