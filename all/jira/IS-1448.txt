comment: Sample is attached  [^sacume2.pdf] . Please note that I added a blank page on the back of page one, this is where the backer/disclosure will be displayed when printed. This is so the disclosure eform won't overlap with page 3 if a statement has multiple pages. I also updated the code to use two trays instead of one. Page 1 will print duplex and the subsequent pages simplex.

the print samples look good,

does this need to be sent for client approval? or I can release it for PR?
