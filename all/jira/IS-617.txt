Volume: 300,000



Turn Over Date:12/6/2021or earlier (Final version of Cover Letter and Terms & Conditions must be delivered by Turnover Date, if not we will not be able to meet the Go Live date)

1stSample Date:12/10/2021

Approval Date: 12/15/2021

Live Date: 12/22/2021

Processing Date: 12/29/2021

Mail Drop Date: On or before1/7/2022



Add 2d barcode in upper right corner:

The value is the member number. Please refer to Member Statement Program (APCUMS21.dfa) for the logic to code the 2d bar code in the upper right corner (see below for example)


Add 3 digit hardcoded value of *tc


Because of ignoring the mail code we want to add this special code above address block (for return mail)*tc.

This is similar to many documents we sent out already including the Member Statements (see example below and also refer to APCUMS21.dfa)


Cover Letter [simplex] & 2 Page Terms & Conditions [duplex]

No Inline Insert. This new letter needs to be coded to receive physical inserts.

Program will use the date in the file name for the letter date.

Use existing APCUDLC Program

No BRE

Stock Code:

PP1="3346"
ENV1="5147"
ENV2="5147"


Print and PDF Archival ONLY

Mail all statements. All statements are forced to be mailed. There will not be any suppression.

NO eStmts (i.e. e-suppression = 'z')

Include two line insert (pages 2 & 3 will be the Terms & Conditions and will be printed duplex on 4000).

PDF archival file output file name will remain the same (i.e. APCU_DN_Archival_MMDDYY_<SEG#>.zip.<SEQ #> )

zip file name: APCU_DN_Archival_<mmddyy>_<#seg>.zip.<seq#>.pgp

e.g.:

APCU_DN_Archival_110921_1.zip.001

APCU_DN_Archival_110921_1.zip.002

APCU_DN_Archival_110921_1.zip.003

...

...

This means, moving forward all files will this will be the permanent file naming convention for the daily notices process.

seq # is a 3 digit number to identify the multi-part batch number whenever zip file reaches 10,000 files.

Zip Logic will need to be changed to zip files by 10,000 file each.

Please see attached final draft of letter for APCU Terms & Conditions. I submitted the pages 2 & 3 which will be printed as a physical insert to Gabriel via the Team Support ticket.

comment: Hi [~William.Kong] 
We need the updated sow including following information:
1. In existing project ltr 095 has been archived separately and rest of the letters have been archived together. so new letter will be archived with rest of the letters except letter 095 with newly added splitting logic(previously no splitting logic). And new splitting logic will be applicable for letter 095 as well, as this one being archived separately
2. Letter code for new letter
3. " No Inline Insert. This new letter needs to be coded to receive physical inserts." so we need insert bin information, which one will be used.
4. Data file naming convention
Thanks
Tanmay

comment: [~tanmay]

We will use Bin 1. I don't have the insert number to update in the SOW, I spoke to Inventory Control and they said we won't get that until it is received at the end of December.



Yes we understand the insert will not be available in archival only the letter that is being coded.

This looks good to me, are we able to move to QA?


author: jharvey
comment: [~tanmay] [~William.Kong]

The client requested that we make the following changes in the cover letter per their compliance department. Are you able to update and provide new samples?

Hi Joye,

Our Compliance team noticed a few mistakes we made and are wondering if there is anyway to correct them. It's nothing too major (see screenshot below), but let me know if this isn't possible. I have also attached an upda[^Notice Cover Letter regarding 2021 changes to TC including arbitration provision - updated.DOCX]ted word doc.

Do we have an updated sample for client to review?


author: tanmay
comment: [~jharvey]
We will send it friday since we arescheduled to other projects.


author: jharvey
comment: [~tanmay]

We really need this today or tomorrow because we still need to gain approval, complete parallel, and go live on the 22nd. If we don't get the sample until Friday we won't be able to keep the timeline.

Sample (apcudl0103_12162021.pdf) has been attached generating from local. But you need to review since QA is pending at our end, if okay you can send it to client.

Please see mapping information and approved samples attached below.



*Delimited file**name*:*_Terms_Conditions_Update_NOTICE#_***(with typical 10 fields just like our normal daily notices)

Member Number|Member Name|Street|Extra Address|City|State|Zip|Country|Current Date|Mail Code.

*NOTE*: Though Mail Code is included (for consistency sake), no letters are to be suppressed for any reason. Mail out all letters. We understand that many will come back to us as a bad address.



Because of ignoring the mail code we want to add this special code above address block (for return mail)**tc.*

This is similar to many documents we sent out already including the Member Statements (see example below)





*Add small 2d barcode in top-right corner:*Just like with our Member Statements we want to add a 2d barcode that simply includes the member number so we can scan it to keep track of those that come back in the mail.

I received word from Jared that the wrong letter name was contained in the archival he received for this job. I included a screenshot below. Would you please make sure this is corrected? Once we release code for the update to the archival naming convention in IS-704, we need to reproduce the archival for this job for APCU.



Episys - Annual Donation Notice was used in the index file when it should have been Episys - Terms and Conditions Update. See below

comment: [~jharvey]: This ticket is closed and the issue reported above is out of scope and unrelated to this ticket. I will allow this to be part of the new Jira ticket. Please go ahead and update the other Jira ticket. But bear in mind, this update will delay the project by a day which means 1/6 afternoon code release as originally planned.
