title: DSi Windows Server:  JumpStation/Shared Resource Server
description: Hi Kent,

Per my text message request. DSi made the following request that I reviewed:



Setup Windows GUI Based Shared Server:



This server will server the following goals:

#1. The ability for DSi to preview/view resource files (e.g.: Images: Logos/Preprints/PDFs/Check images) w/o having to download all the files from InfoIMAGE to DSi, unzip them, and view them. 



#2. BA does not have access to the output of DSi's work. So I plan to also give BA RDP access to this server and so that they can review the output from DSi. 



This is a rough flowchart I'm proposing. Only the windows server and the BA/IM/AC/IS & DSi groups is new. !image-2020-03-18-08-45-33-379.png!

comment: [~hesham.hanna] & [~kent.chan]:  Thanks for working on this old ticket to be applied to Brisbane. We will definitely need it.



[~hesham.hanna]: If DSi currently has sharepoint accounts, can we reuse the same usernames? Please discuss with Kent to get his approvals:



If so, the username are documented in Smartsheet for sharepoint:

comment: [~rony]: Once you have your VPN working, can you test out this system:



ca-DSIJump-pr-03 10.5.20.110



Use the same sharepoint username and password that you currently have. Thanks!

Can you please add this entry in this sheet [https://app.smartsheet.com/sheets/mFf6v3fj63jmPqX5GwHQ7cF563hfF4mJ8pPmMhP1]

and also give permission to all our users?



As I already know that you are busy with Brisbane migration, we can wait on this one.

We also need to install some necessary software on this machine.

If you want I can notify you later on this after the migration.
