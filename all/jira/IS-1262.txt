See samples attached. For the second account on page 9, the amount -$1,451.10 was originally in the deposit column but it's been updated to show in the withdrawal column.

comment: Hi [~Andrey.Kutsenko] (FYI [~lemoy28] )

The client found additional issues with the mapping, I apologize that I did not realize everything that was affected:
 * *On page 7 of the samples[^hfcu_stmt_updated_dep_wth.pdf] the draft section is incorrect now.*

 * *The Account Activity Summary pie chart is now also incorrect*

Here is the client's feedback; let me know if you want to have an internal call for clarification on what they are asking for:

*"Based on the screenshots of the .xml data you provided, it would be most convenient for our members if transactions with a Category of Deposit are posted to the Deposit column of the statement and transactions with a Category of Withdrawal are posted to the Withdrawal column of the statement rather than relying on the negative sign of the dollar value. When the transactions are posted to their respective columns, they should be posted using the exact value that appears in the .xml data  if the value is negative, post the dollar amount as a negative value regardless of the statement column and vice versa. With this change, when our member total all deposit and withdrawals in their respective columns, their totals will match the totals found on their pie charts and at the end of their checking transaction history. If InfoImage is able to add Adjustment to the description when applicable, this should help members to discern whether or not the item is a credit back to their account or a debit from their account for any returned funds.*

*Please see the attached for an example of our proposed update in comparison to the current formatting and the last update:"* !Screenshot 2022-06-23 114332.png!

I've also added the word "Adjustment" to the description when there's a correction.

first account - withdrawal adjustment

second account - deposit adjustment

third account - loan payment correction

Sorry, I must have misplaced the name when I extracted the data to create the samples.

The samples have been corrected. See attached.
