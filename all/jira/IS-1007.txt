comment: Hi [~thomasY]

Sorry to bother you here.From CVS log, you were also involved in contributing to this dfa.

Please see if you can help me here with this:

In main docformat of RWCUDLW1.dfa it is assigning LTR_TYPE to TAX if SBA is found so that prevents LTR_TYPE to be equal to SBA. but in print_doc it is also checking if LTR_TYPE is SBA. Is this correct?

comment: Hi [~dyuen]

Can I get a test data file for it?


author: dyuen
comment: [~rony], I requested an update TIF from RWCU. They should be able to provide. If not, I will ask Wilson.

I updated the description with the test file.


author: thomasy
comment: [~rony]That's correct. The SBA in the print doc is old logic. Those letters are disabled and the data with SBA is being routed to the 3 TAX letters instead

Any feedback for the artwork?



Thanks


author: rony
comment: Hi [~dyuen]

Would you please also ask if the client is ok with the current footer? Because the client didn't mention this change, I just noticed it in the doc file ( mapping provided by the client) and hence asked for new artwork. Please check with the client if they are ok with the current footer then we don't need any artwork and that is actually convenient for us too.



Thanks

Rony


author: dyuen
comment: Hi [~rony], I'm checking on this with the client. I'm inclined to say that they do want the footer updated even if they didn't mention it. However, I will wait for a final confirmation from RWCU before letting you know.

Thanks


author: dyuen
comment: [~rony], please proceed with original updates/request. We will revisit updating the footer another time.

Thanks
