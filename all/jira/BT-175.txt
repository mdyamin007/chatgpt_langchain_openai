What is the expected value here? Can you check with ISD for this issue?

comment: Hi [~tohidulI]
I expect "HTML Notice", but got "HTML Statement"

I don't think we ever had specs to determine that the over-hover popup should be "HTML Notice". "HTML Statement" is not incorrect. Everything is a Statement. The eNotices can be seen "Notice Statements" or "eNotice Statements". Similarly, this also extends to Tax Statements.

If you hover the PDF, it would also say "PDF Statement". I think this is more of a design choice. I don't think it would confuse anyone.

comment: [~Andrey.Kutsenko] [~tai.trinh] Yes, we can leave as is based on hovering over the icon. Thank you!

comment: [~Andrey.Kutsenko]Can you test on this. Change is deployed on stage. Instead of 'PDF Statement' or 'HTML Statement' now new verbiage is 'PDF Document' and 'HTML Document'

This is fixed.
