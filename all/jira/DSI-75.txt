title: Add Customer validation not working IE11
description: GCBK admin site allows creation of customer profile.

Account number should be a number but they have gotten a non-number through the production site. I tested on IE11 and it skips the validation completely.

Also please review if chrome & firefox correctly validate the create profile workflow.

Create profile validation works in chrome & firefox. There were issues with IE11, I have fixed those and committed the code in brunch.
thanks.
