*enrollPreference:*Data will be paginated according to the account.viewLimit. Previously for a large number of accounts, it took much time to draw HTML elements on the enrollPreference page. Now the element drawing time has been reduced. Test all the functionality on the enrollment page.



If the number of accounts is less than 20 (or less than account.viewLimit ) then pagination will not be applicable.

We will not support odd numbers as "account.viewLimit".

Test all the functionality in sso enrollment for byUfa, byUsr notification type. Also for bySelective paperless and non selective paperless. Test with only email, only sms and both sms and email.

*Code has been deployed on stage.*

Here are the sample sso test files:

[^ffin_multiple_account.html]

[^dacb_multiple_account.html]

[^banb_multiple_account.html]

[^acbk_multiple_account.html]

[~rifat.mahmud] [~mamunur.rashid] - who is the project manager for this project?
Would it be possible to *extend *the  *due date?*

Can you confirm the due date? We were planning to release it on the 24th.

comment: [~Igor.Khosid] [~nprimak] We can move the due date to the 26th. Is that enough time?

 - Any updates?

[~nprimak] - while testing "prints" we are very often using "DEMO" versions ... FYI

It is okay if FFIN has DEMO statement in the enrollment step. They wanted it this way. It is in production too.

You asked for users with multiple accounts. The four sso test files that I provided have multiple accounts.

Thanks.

Verified enrollment pagination and performed regression test for FFIN, DACB, BANB, ACBK staging, no issues.
