comment: [~gthillaivel] I mentioned this as well in IS-1554, I believe PC needs to enable some estatement flags in order for the All/Paper/Estatement tabs to show under job status. [~phoebe.george] requested already so I think we're just waiting on their response.

comment: [~gthillaivel] [~Shun.Kuwashima] - PC has enabled eStmt job tracking for pilot, staging and production. Thanks!

comment: Thanks [~phoebe.george], I reposted the index file and I can now see it under job status on Infotrac stage. Please note that ivbk does not have extended tracking enabled, therefore the envelope button is expected not to show (this is how it is on production as well).

[~gthillaivel] Fyi, see above.

comment: [~phoebe.george] -  Please do not change the "Assignee" the assignee should stay the same as initially assigned by QA

[~gthillaivel] - FYI
