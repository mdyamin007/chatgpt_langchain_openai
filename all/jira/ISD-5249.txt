comment: Hi Tui and Shun, the client received a test email today for return mail. I just want to check that it is all set up now? Do you need anything?

comment: [~andreav] I was just assigned this last Friday, so I haven't done anything yet. I think I should still be able to make the live date of 10/12, however there are a couple things I need to know before I can start:
* Does the client want to use pgp encryption?
* Which FTP location should we drop off the report? I see a ufcu folder in both Secure3 and Secure4, not sure which one they want.

Thanks,
Shun

comment: OMG! We have to make the live date since this has been on our radar for some time. To answer your questions:

* Does the client want to use pgp encryption? {color:#00875A}My understanding is the report is available on InfoTRAC under the "Return Mail" tab so no need to encrypt. (See SOW on parent Ticket IMPL-1692){color}
* Which FTP location should we drop off the report? I see a ufcu folder in both Secure3 and Secure4, not sure which one they want. {color:#00875A}Does not go to FTP. See answer to #1 above.{color}

comment: Hi [~andreav],

Interesting, yeah I just checked and the Return mail tab is already enabled on production. If there is no need for encryption and no necessity to drop it off via FTP, then I'm not sure if I really need to do anything else. Let me check with the team and I'll provide an update to you tomorrow.

comment: [~andreav], I think we don't need to do anything else on ISD's end. Most of the work is usually revolving around encryption and setting the client pickup path, both of which we are not doing. Since the tab is already enabled on production, I think we are all set. Let me know if you have any other questions.

Thanks,
Shun

comment: Also let me know if I can close this ISD ticket if there is nothing else needed.
