title: Hypercube - Enhance SSO7 to Accept stmt_type Parameter in SSO Request to Set Statement Tab
description: Update due date accordingly.



Requirements:
 # If *overrideStmtTypeLanding*={color:#00875a}{color:#172b4d}true, look for stmt_type parameter during SSO request{color}.{color}
 # If stmt_type parameter is not found, normal logic entails.
 # If stmt_type parameter is found, we'll use the value to determine the default landing tab. (Normally default landing tab is the "default" statements? or the first type defined?)
 # If the value is not one that we recognize, we will also use normal logic, e.g. SSO pass something like STMT, which is not a type that we have.
 # If the value is one we recognize, we will always land on that tab, regardless if there are statements or not.
