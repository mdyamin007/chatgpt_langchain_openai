title: PFCU - Hypercube DP "both" support on SSO enrollment for non-selective  
description: !image001.png!

1. On SSO enrollment the Both option only shows up when selective paperless is enabled. It does not otherwise. We should fix this.

2.There is a difference in verbiage for DP, the first column is shown from the flag, and the second column is shown from CSS. This is how it works.

3. Change verbiage for session time out error page.

4. Customize session timeout time based on the client-wise flag.

comment: Hi [~Ethan.Yu],

I have committed and deployed the PFCU code on pilot.

Chnages are,
 # Changed the DPverbiage as "Electronic", "Paper", and "Both" just like the Profile page instead of the verbiage that's currently there..
 # Introduced a new flag "sessionTTL" to customized the session time out time. Currently set to "900sec" that means 15mins.
 # Now non-selective user can see DP "Both" option in sso enrollment page

I have added the release note to the ticket. Let me know if you want to know something.



Thanks,

Sadman
