comment: [~shahadet.hossain] [~Azad] [~tai.trinh] EWBB is working with their HK team to get new files sent. Because this may take time, Karen at EWBB is asking if we can manually update the file to MMDDYYYY and test for posting to pilot. She wants to confirm if any other issues with the posted version so that HK can address any additional changes needed all at one time. Let me know if possible to complete and target ETA (if 2/4 is possible). Thanks!


author: shahadet.hossain
comment: Hello [~phoebe.george],

We have posted that cycle after updating the zip file name in the index file. The posting was successful in the pilot.




author: phoebe.george
comment: [~shahadet.hossain] Can you confirm if the posted eNotices should show up under an eNotice tab? I tried checking on Admin Site pilot and when through with customer through SSO pilot and we did not see a separate tab. Please confirm, thanks!


author: azad
comment: [~phoebe.george], [~shahadet.hossain]

The issue was that the begin date and end date in the dnb index file was on wrong format (MMddyyyy). For that reason, in the database the closing_date was saved outside the archival range. As no statement was found on the archival period, the Admin Site did not show any enotice tab. For testing purpose, I changed the date on the database and was able to view the enotice statement on pilot Admin Site. Here is an screenshot. The client can search account with this account number and view the enotice on the pilot Admin Site.

!Screenshot from 2022-02-09 21-58-37.png!

The begin date and end date in the index file should be on yyyyMMdd format.

Thanks.


author: phoebe.george
comment: Thanks for the feedback, I have informed EWBB. Thanks!


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~Azad] In talking with the customer, they are having their programmer update the index file to update the format of the date for the begin/end date.

One request to see if this is possible - as the update to the index file will take some time, EWBB is asking if we can assist to test load the file into the pilot site by manually updating the format in the index file for begin/end date correctly.

They have a separate team that needs to validate the display of the eNotices once posted to ensure it is displaying as expected. Although you provided a screenshot, they are hoping to review this site via their pre-prod SSO to access pilot. I know this is not a normal request, so let me know if this is possible - they ensured that the date format is being worked on to update so we can re-test that file accurately when it arrives. Thank you!


author: azad
comment: Hi [~phoebe.george]

I've manually updated the date to correct format (20211201) and re-posted the index file. Please take a look.

Thanks!


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~Azad] EWBB had some feedback. They are only able to view the notices on the Admin Portal - can you confirm if these should be visible on customer site pilot also?

Separately, each of the eNotices posted have a description of 'Document' - but there should be specific eNotice descriptions based on notice name. These are the names (tied to the notice number):

Transaction Advice = 301
Deposit Confirmation = 302
Remittance Advice Debit = 303
Remittance Advice Credit = 304
FX confirmation = 305


author: azad
comment: Hi [~phoebe.george]

The description of 'Document' displays if the database does not have a description stored for that specific letter code. Provided letter codes (301, 302, 303, 304, 305) are stored with their respective descriptions. But all enotices in the processed dnb index file has letter code '002', which is not stored in the database. For this reason 'Document' is showing as default description.

Also, about the issue for the enotices not showing in the customer pilot site, I am looking into it.

Thanks

Azad


author: azad
comment: [~phoebe.george]

Can you try again, customer site should be able to show enotices now. Let me know if you can't view them yet.

A point to be noted here, the accounts for which the enotices have been processed, do not have any user associated with them, as the process does not create user-account mapping for EWBB. So, if EWBB wants to view the enotices from the customer site, an AUTH process should be run for those accounts to be able to login in the site.

Thanks

comment: [~Azad] EWBB provided the following feedback on the pilot site - can you confirm if the information they are requesting is dynamic based on the tab for the right panel changes?

I let EWBB know that I believed this area was global for the site itself, but please confirm. Let me know if you can update the headers/tabs though as indicated on attached document. Thank you!



[^EWBB_Pilot_Feedback_HK eAdvice_Validation_032322.docx]


author: azad
comment: Hi [~phoebe.george] [~Tin.Chak],

Currently there are 3 view templates that are being used to display the statements(different list_inc.jspf pages). One for displaying the etaxes, one for the enotices and one for all the other statements like default, mmidas, HK etc. 
The section heading and the right side disclosure panel changes can be done as these views are loaded for eNotice(eAdvice) tab only. So, other statement types won't get affected.


So, we can change all the eNotices to eAdvices in this page. But here's an important thing to note that, as of now EWBB does not have enotices for any user and currently only Hong Kong users are going to have enotices. If we make these code changes, they will be reflacted for all the EWBB users who will have enotices in the future. That means, they will be restricted to view the tab and other headers and also the disclosure texts as "eAdvice", not enotice.

Thanks!




author: phoebe.george
comment: [~Azad] Sorry for the delay, I just talked with EWBB on the feedback you provided.

Can you confirm if there is a NEW eNotice setup in the future (separate from these HK eAdvice notices), if they are setup under a new application prefix and tab name, will these updates that are being requested still impact? Because these are 'PDF notices, they are not running through the current IS program for setup, so these would for sure be a different prefix for setup.

[~Tin.Chak] FYI


author: azad
comment: Hi [~phoebe.george],

I am not sure if there is any new eNotice setup (apart from HK eAdvice) in the future for EWBB. If there is then, these updates will impact the future eNotice setups. In the backend (PUI and Database), HK eAdvice and general eNotice are same in terms of statement type.

The prefixes might be different for same statement type but the description (for HK it is 'eAdvice') is same for a particular statement type (for example enotice). So if we change the enotice description to eAdvice, all future EWBB enotices will be called 'eAdvice' only.

So in summary, we can't change the enotice page as per HK requirement. However, we can change them if there is no new eNotice setup for EWBB in the future.

Note: previously I've updated the tab name to eAdvice. This update will have to be reverted back to eNotice also.

[~Tin.Chak]FYI.

Thanks!


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~Azad] Thanks for the update! I talked in depth with EWBB on this item tied to the 'eNotice' setup and future jobs. 

[~Tin.Chak]FYI

The bank would like to proceed with the following changes:
 # Please update the header bar (item #1 from the original list) to read as: 'Notice' (instead of eNotice).
 # Update the disclosure and contact information to the following:

Important Disclosures:

This is on online version of your bank document. You will receive an email when new document is available for viewing. 

To view your document, you must have Adobe Acrobat Reader 6.0 or higher installed on your computer (click on the "Get Acrobat Reader" button below if you need to install it.)



Need Help?

If you are having trouble using this site, please contact Customer Care at 852.2218.9010, Monday through Friday 9:00AM to 5:30PM HKT.



3. Please see remove the Account Reconciliation button/verbiag.

4. See above for item #2 (includes updated contact information).



Note, that EWBB is hoping we can still go live by end of April, I'm going to update the live date for now. But please let me know what the ETA for making these final changes, and I'll set a final due date for pilot site approval.

Thank you!

comment: [~Azad] Thank you, we are pending final approval on the pilot site based on the latest changes.

Separately though, EWBB has sent a final test file to load to the pilot site so they can review the final updates made to their scripting as well for the data files.

I have attached here - can these be loaded to pilot?

Also, in order to automate their file transmission, they are asking if we can accept a file name with the hour time stamp, example would be: ewbb_dnb_MMDDYYYY_1_1_hhmmss.zip.pgp

Also, Current configuration will not accept a file name like this (ewbb_dnb_MMDDYYYY_1_1_hhmmss.zip). We need to change the configuration on Scanner to accept this.

Thanks

comment: Thank you! EWBB is reviewing the pilot for final approval.

They would like to move forward with the outer file name change, this will allow them to fully automate file transmission. Here is the file name: ewbb_dnb_MMDDYYYY_1_1_hhmmss.zip.pgp

Let me know if any issues to move forward with this final change. Thank you!

comment: [~shahadet.hossain], please set up the ftp scanner so that it will take the zip file as named asPhoebe mentioned on the previous comment.

author: phoebe.george
comment: [~Azad] Thank you! One other separate question came up from EWBB, not sure if you are able to answer this.

_We had setup a monthly accumulate enrollment report to be pushed to the HK side for eStatement. So with the eAdvice rollout, HK team would like to ask if this report can be sent daily? And I want to verify that if a user havent enroll to eStatement but they want to review eAdvice first, will the enrollment be captured in the enrollment report?_

[~Tin.Chak] Not sure if you can assist to help answer above question from EWBB as it ties to their eAdvice/notice setup.


author: shahadet.hossain
comment: [~Azad], I have updated FTP scanner to accept the file names such asewbb_dnb_MMDDYYYY_1_1_hhmmss.zip

[~phoebe.george]will it be a *.zip.pgp* file or *.zip* file? We have updated and tested for *.zip*file.


author: phoebe.george
comment: [~Azad] [~shahadet.hossain] There is one final cosmetic change for the pilot site, EWBB would like to update the following:
 # Update the eAdvice page display with a minor update  change the Important Disclosures to Important Messages: on the right side of the landing page.

!image-2022-05-19-08-39-01-293.png!

Once updated, they will do a final check and provide approval on the site. If you are able to update tomorrow, they can provide final approval targeted for 5/23.

Once approved, they are also finalizing their automation for file transmission (as the previous test files were sent directly to me). They would like about 5 days of file transmission, and asked if we can post some of these to pilot once transmitted to confirm automation.



Based on this, let me know if any questions, or if you feel we can target a live date for 6/3.



Thank you,

Phoebe

As per above descriptions, the letters names should be as follow:

Transaction Advice = 301
Deposit Confirmation = 302
Remittance Advice Debit = 303
Remittance Advice Credit = 304
FX confirmation = 305
However, all processed on-stage letters on the Admin site are the same.
"Remittance Advice Debit" also the content of the letters - are the same

[~phoebe.george] - wondering if you have the mock ups?


author: azad
comment: [~Igor.Khosid],

I've run the file now. Document date is June 11, 2022. Account and letter mapping is following:
 * 000028 = 301
 * 100786 = 302
 * 602279 = 303
 * 602519 = 304
 * 603022 = 305

All the statements content are same. I did not have different types of letter sample. So I've used same type documents as mock up and processed with different letter codes, just to test the functionality and presentment from both Customer and Admin site.

For this reason, all of those documents content are same like "Remittance Advice Debit" - as those are actually 303 type letter.

[~Igor.Khosid] The location of the file is in the new AC secure share folder: V:\dsi_eservices\ewbb_dnb_06272022_1_1_161824.zip

File name: ewbb_dnb_06272022_1_1_161824 (this file is decrypted by DP already)

Let me know if you can access so you can see what the PDF looks like for posting.

Thanks,

Phoebe

Code is released to Production

Thanks

comment: [~Azad] EWBB does not have email approval for their other apps, yet it is enabled for enotice.  This caused some issues around email sending, I manually approved it in the database so we can send those out. Can you perhaps update the code and disable email approval so that the approval status no longer shows for only the enotice template?

Also I didn't see any test enotice email jobs on lower environments. Please make sure to test emails for any new app setup so that we can catch these issues before releasing to production.

comment: Thank you [~Shun.Kuwashima]. I've updated the code. Email approval is now disabled for enotice.


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: Thanks [~Azad], can you also deploy that to dev and stage so that we can maintain consistency between environments?


author: azad
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima]dev and stage environments are also updated.

comment: [~Azad] Not sure if you are able to check anything on your end, but EWBB reported an issue with the eAdvice. I created ticket #30845 if you can view on Team Support, but I assigned to Shun to research. Thanks!

comment: [~Azad] Per the client's last response on 7/20 around 10:54am PT, the issue resolved itself. I tried looking into it but I was not able to find anything related to it. Can you double check?

comment: HI [~Shun.Kuwashima]

I rechecked the logs and did not find any differences to make out the cause of this issue. Also, I am seeing the team-support ticket is also being closed.

If this issue occurs again we can recheck then.

I am moving this ticket to done. Let me know if any issue occurs.

[~phoebe.george] [~Tin.Chak]fyi.

Thanks

Azad
