comment: Hi [~Shun.Kuwashima], I just noticed that this story doesn't have ISD hours quoted. IS already assessed it. Hopefully this isn't too late to assess and match the timeline IS gave.

Thanks!

comment: Hi [~dyuen] no worries, this looks like an update to a couple of the notices themselves, so I assume at most it's either a resource upload or just estatement verification/testing. Please add 1 hour for this story, we can match IS timeline.

Would it be possible to rename the resource to S1SEFCD3.300? I just noticed S1SEFCD2.300 is being used already.

Are you able to check if this index shows the new resource? We had to rename the resource name because S1SEFCD2.300 was used already.
