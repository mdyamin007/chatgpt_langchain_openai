Previous pseg name for ALFC is S1FCBTAL.300, new given pseg name is S1ALFCLG.300. can we rename it to previous one.
FYIS1FCBTAL.300 has used only daily and monthly and no other project.
Thanks

comment: Hi [~Peter.Dang]Can you advise on this.



Samples were due yesterday.


author: mattl
comment: [~Peter.Dang] [~William.Kong] [~TunA]



Please advise. Samples are two days late.


author: peter.dang
comment: Tanmay,



As long the daily notice and fund help application does not have estatement, you can use the current pseg name.

comment: Hi [~MattL]

I couldn't find a data for fund held for alfc. So I am providing samples from my local machine with random data. Would it be possible to ask client to send a data file for alfc fund held.
