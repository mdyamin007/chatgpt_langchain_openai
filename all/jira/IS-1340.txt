/d/ac-secure-share/imp/juliana/is-1340/sscuml4_073122_1_1.zip is the archival sample. It is pass protected . Pass is:*safecu*



[~Juliana Vannik] [~phoebe.george]somehow we missed this story to work on for good amount of time, which is very bad of us. Would you please knock me in zoom also if this scenerio happens where there is no activity for significant amount of type just to confirm that we are aware we have this job to do.



Thanks
