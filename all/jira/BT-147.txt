I am sorry to say, I don't have much knowledge about how to test the imb bar code and detect if it's correct or wrong. Would you please share this knowledge?



And also the bar code is generated from a standard script that is being used for many projects. So if the bar code value is incorrect we might need to talk to the manager say, Terrence.

Most likely, IMb code is not needed for heavy letters.

[~Bryanl] Do we need to print IMb code for heavy letters?
