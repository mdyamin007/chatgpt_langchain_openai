description: [~premraj.patil]: Can you confirm nfs port is opened:



!image-2020-09-09-13-14-26-217.png!





Unfortunately the ca-isis-dv-01 (10.5.20.39) and ca-isis-ds-01(10.5.20.38) does not have telnet command for me to troubleshoot:

this is the error message I'm getting:

!image-2020-09-09-13-15-31-767.png!





Also, can you update the hostname for ca-isis-dv-01 -> rht

and ca-isis-ds-01 -> dsi
