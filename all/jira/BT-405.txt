This is because the message manager message that comes from the server(Infotrac stage) is empty. But in local papyrus, the message is not empty.

This is a test message was printed in the print sample and in the Papyrus PDF ,it displayes the MM text.
Passing this bug as per Rony as this is MM verbiage
