title: PFCU - [22871][pvt] Develop method to keep email addresses current in InfoIMAGE
description: The columns needed for the auth file will be - cif | usrname | acctname | acctnum | accttype | firstname | middlname | lastname | acct_restriction | nickname | email | delivery preference | notification preference

(difference is adding email column, delivery preference column, and notification preference column at the end)



So the valid values to pass in for delivery preference field are: "P", "E", or "W" (P for paper, E for electronic, W for both). Keep the letters capital.

The valid values to pass in for notification preference are: "email" (just keep it as email for all records)



Here's an example record taken from the first line of the sample file the client provided:

21|JOHN BEMENT|JOHN BEMENT|14857928|00|JOHN||BEMENT|0|Savings|jdbement@statestreet.com|E|email
