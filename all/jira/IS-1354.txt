Can you please give a breakdown of the hours? Client is asking why posting to e-notices would require print programming as well, thanks!


author: rony
comment: Hi [~Bryanl]

Because currently from print side we are suppressing this notice to post to enotice. So we need to remove the suppression logic from our code. The isd can be able to post it. Let me know if that make sense.

isd index file for pilot isdla_20220514_1_20220722_0602_wash.txt. Please post and you will see 048 has enotice now.



We couldn't find any production data file where 048 letter is included. So we ran it with local data file.
