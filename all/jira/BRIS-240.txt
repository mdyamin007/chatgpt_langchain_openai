title: Unable to access link externally
description: Kent/Ferhat,

Can you help check these URL as we are not able to access it externally.

For InfoTRAC, can you also confirm if the secure infotrac Dns has been created as well.

[https://bb-infotrac.infoimageinc.com/login.do]

[https://bb-cb-prod.infoimageinc.com|https://bb-cb-prod.infoimageinc.com/]



BTW: Can we have access to these proxy so that we can also validate some of the configuration.



Thanks

David

Before I look into the bb-cb-prod page, what should the page look like? I checked the menlo URL and it gave me access forbidden which is what I get for the BB URL

comment: I am not 100% sure how the proxy has configured but it should route the traffic to the following URLs which will give 400 if you hit them from your browser

When I hit infotrac-infoimageinc.com for secured clients it will navigate url to infotrac-secure.infoimageinc.com

When I hit bb-infotrac.infoimageinc.com where should I redirect url,{color:#de350b} bb-infotrac-secure.infoimageinc.com?{color}



Is bb-inoftrac-secure.infoimageinc.com valid?

Below is the Menlo infotrac secure url. Brisbane should also show login page if it is set up properly.

I tested the [https://infotrac-secure.infoimageinc.com|https://infotrac-secure.infoimageinc.com/]URL from my cell to ensure there was no internal network dependency which may lead to false results and I was given an access denied page for the Menlo secure URL. Again, I also received a denied page for Brisbane URL as well, so for our side, it seems consistent.

comment: Right now infotrac external url issue is resolved.



Updates done:

-server.xml is updated to support apache url.

-Updated ssl conf files of secure and normal urls
