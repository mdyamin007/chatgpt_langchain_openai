comment: RWCU did not mention anything about an endorsement on this letter. Either way, I'm confirming with them. I'll update the bug once I have an answer.

comment: [~misbah.uddin@dsinnovators.com], [~berezinez]did not see an endorsement on the letter. Can you provide a sample with a "Return Service Requested" endorsement verbiage on the letter itself? RWCU would like to see what it looks like since they need an endorsement on the letters.

Thanks
