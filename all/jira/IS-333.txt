The file named TransRepo will always contain checking accounts, which is an account type of 6 and need to be posted to eNotice site,

The file named TimeRepo will always contain Time accounts, which wouldnt need an account type specified since its NOT to be posted to eNotice.

We have not finalized the input zip file name convention.

Could you check with customer what the file name convention for input zip file?

Also check whether they can send the test zip with that file name.

I can manually rename the PDF files to create the zip file for testing.

If so, please request app # and version # and also the DT_JOB_ID for parallel testing.

Thanks

 As a result. The name of the bank is hardly visible in the logo through the top window in the envelope.
