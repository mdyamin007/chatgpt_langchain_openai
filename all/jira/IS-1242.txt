comment: [~Igor.Khosid] - I made an update to msbkdn1_daily_process.sh to identify and move empty data files to download so DP won't have to manually move it. Check if the file size is less than or equal to 25684 bytes and if md5sum value is 587a28fabd5b52c966e3a6fc0518ce30 to determine if the pdf is empty.
