**From the ticket:

Total amount due: should be the total due without past due amount. In file it looks like this is TotalAmt from thePayment Detail Type="DUE"{color:#FF0000}There is no Payment Detail Type="DUE", I only see Type="PAID" and Type="YTD"{color}

Interest due: in file as InterestAmount{color:#FF0000}Payment Detail Type="PAID" or "YTD"?{color}

Fess/Late Charges: in file as LateChargeAmt{color:#FF0000}Payment Detail Type="PAID" or "YTD"?{color}

Other Charge: in file as OtherChargeAmt ,{color:#FF0000}Payment Detail Type="PAID" or "YTD"?{color}

{color:#172b4d}I'm looking at the 1129 file as an exmple: 1425.1129.437483.LN_BLXTR{color}


author: dyuen
comment: [~thomasY], I forwarded your questions to SEFC. Pending response.


author: dyuen
comment: [~thomasY], please see response from SEFC:

I believe the reason the Developer cannot see the info is due to the LN_BLXTR that is being used.1425.1129.437483.LN_BLXTR only contained paid off HELF's and therefore the info being asked for would be missing.

I am attaching the 01.31.2022 LN_BLXTR. This file has active HELF's that would contain the info the Developer is looking for.

Please let me know if there are additional questions.

It should go through QA; however, it looks like the samples are due today. So we can check on that after the client approves the samples

Final testing will be after the client's approval.

[~dyuen] please provide an updated mapping file.

Please;
1) move the story to "Waiting for QA", if additional development doesn't need;
2) attach IS checklist
