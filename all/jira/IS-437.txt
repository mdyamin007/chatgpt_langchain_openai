comment: HI [~andreav],

Just follow up. This Story is create in 09/01. But we didn't get any deliverables and turn over. Do we have estimate turn-over date?

Thanks!

Tun

comment: Hi Tun, the related TS is 24267. The client does not want to provide last years files for testing because it was from their old core. He is working to get us test files for 2021 but no ETA yet. Here is the SOW link: http://sharepoint-svr/AS/Shared%20Documents/SOW%20Directory/UFCU%20-%20United%20Federal%20Credit%20Union/UFCU%20-%20Tax%20Form%20Print%20Statement%20of%20Work.docx

I will schedule a call with the client to confirm pending items then turn over to you next week.

comment: Hi [~rony],

Could you please assign to [~amirR]? Today [~andreav] turn over SOW to [~jun]and me. Please review SOW andcheck with detail xref files and archival requirements with [~diegof]. We got 1099INT and 1042S IRS test data files today too.

Let Jun or me know if you need anything for internal team.

Thanks,

Tun

Archival samples are in/d/infoftps3/Vend_DSI/client_pickup/print_process/UFCU/tax/archival/ for:

ufcu_1099INT_010622_0132_prod.txt

ufcu_1042S_011222_0132_prod.txt
ufcu_1099Q_010622_0132_prod.txt
ufcu1099MISC.txt
ufcu1099NEC.txt

both zip and pgp versions are there.

One thing to mention about the zip files. It's zip files have sequence no at the end. If client extracts the first sequence of say1099-INT all the sequences will be extracted automatically.

Thanks,

How did you get the zip file naming convention? According to the SOW, I see the following:

comment: Hi Rony, see client feedback below:

	1099-INT forms are approved
	1042-S forms are approved
	1098
Real estate property taxes paid has typically been reported in Box 10 for us.  The data is in the file, but we dont see it reported on the form anywhere.
We identified that PMI (would be reported in box 5) is missing from the data file.  We are reviewing this on our end and will need to get you a new file as soon as its corrected.
	1099-MISC
Sample documents have 2020 data.  Do we need to repost the 2021 files?
	1099-NEC
Sample documents have 2020 data.  Do we need to repost the 2021 files?
	1099-C
We are getting data updated in our core and expect to have a file by the end of the week.

comment: Thank you, I will have DP move the sample archival to the client's FTP pick up folder.

Please see client's feedback and approval below:

The 1099-INT sample from last night didn't have an index file in it.  Do you have that you can send over so we can verify?  All the others looked good.

comment: Rony, can you provide an update on these 2 items:

Can client double-check?

comment: William - For the recipient name missing on the 1099-NEC, Rony reported the data has the name starting at column 248 when it should be 288 per our documentation.

Client says, his documentation reads differently: "The documentation we have says first name starts in 248 (where it is now) and second name (if there is one) starts in 288."

Please confirm which documentation is correct.

comment: Hi [~andreav],

The client needs for review 2021 IRS P1220 publication. IRS updated the Record-B mapping in 2021 tax year. I think client is looking at old 2020 P1220 publication.

comment: The following forms are approved:

Can we move to QA and parallel on these or do all forms have to be approved first?


author: andreav
comment: Hi Rony, we no longer need to produce the 1099-NEC and 1099-MISC forms this year as client sent them. See client's message below and provide a complete archival sample for the 1099-C. Please move rest of forms to QA today.

For the 1099-C, thank you for the additional attachments.  We only received a PDF that had 80 out of 82 records in it.  We didn't receive the full archive file.  Our Accounting team would still like to see the complete file if that can be reposted today.

Are we able to move forward with the forms that have been approved?  Or do we need to wait for each individual form to be approved before everything can move forward?  Particularly the 1099-INT and 1098 since those are the highest volume by far, can those go to production while we work our the data issue with the NEC forms?

No need to modify anything for 1099misc. That sample is actually run with the previous year ( in the insert file ) which is why it didn't pull the correct backer. If you check the sample the front page you probably see 2020 instead of 2021.
