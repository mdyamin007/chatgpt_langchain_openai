comment: Hi [~MattL]

Any update on this?



[~Igor.Khosid]



Thanks


author: mattl
comment: Hi [~rony]/[~Igor.Khosid],



Client advised on some changes.



1 - we have an updated privacy policy, please use the updated attached version replacing what we sent before. (attached here & on comment 102 of ticket 27692)

2 - Can the terms and conditions be printed two pages per page? this was designed to be a smaller brochure. we are fine having it print on 8x11, but they can be half sheet, 2 pages printed vertically on each side of each sheet. Does that make sense?

[Terms and Conditions Sample.pdf|https://app.na3.teamsupport.com/dc/1/attachments/15440834]what the client is looking for however he was wonder if we resize to fit the entire page.


author: rony
comment: Hi [~MattL]



So you are saying the pdf you attached which are currently displaying in 2 pages front and back, should be displayed in one page say, front page?



[~Sheikh_Fahim]



Thanks


author: mattl
comment: [~rony]Yes 2 pages front & back should be displayed on the front page, then the next two pages should be the back page.

Does that make sense?


author: rony
comment: Hi [~MattL]



Yes got it. But would it be possible for client or wilson to provide us the tiff images like how client wants?



Thanks


author: rony
comment: Hi [~MattL]

Any update of getting tiff images?



[~Sheikh_Fahim]



Thanks


author: mattl
comment: [~rony]



No, followed up with client on Friday, still no response.


author: mattl
comment: Hi [~rony]& [~Sheikh_Fahim]

Updated TIS TIFs are on comment 129 in InfoCARE ticket 27692.


author: rony
comment: Hi [~MattL]

Need to discuss here a bit. The client provided the tiff images which are now horizontally 11 inches and vertically 8 inch which is the opposite of the paper it will be printed. This is a little bit confusing to us. Maybe we can change the orientation of those tiff images while displaying, kind of like below (which we did for hfcu monthly):

!image-2022-08-04-12-18-13-271.png!



But we need to discuss a little more before making an update. Maybe we should let the manager say Terrence knows about this to get his opinion.



[~Sheikh_Fahim]

Thanks

Rony


author: mattl
comment: Hi [~rony]I am aware.



The client changed based on our operations teams (Wilson's) recommendation. the T&S portion will now be 8 x11 portrait duplex. because it is easier to read.

Client is inquiring about the first page of the document "your statement is attached". Is that page necessary because this is a Hvy?


author: rony
comment: Hi [~MattL]

Yes, that's our normal convention to put this on the cover page.



[~Sheikh_Fahim]

Thanks


author: mattl
comment: [~rony] [~Sheikh_Fahim],



Client approved. Please advise on which DPVS to use for print samples, file name, and print range.



Also please insure that this file can be printed in Texas.



Still waiting to find out if NECU would still like print samples send to them. In order to determine live date.
