My understanding for this update is that it is to improve the security of DSO only, right? SSO is not affected. I do not see any updates related to SSO.

Thanks,
Tai

Yes, for DSO there are more code changes but this update hasalso some effect on SSO after login. After DSO or SSO login every time any request comes from the frontend side it goes to *Router.before* where I change some code to validate the cookie.

Okay, understood. It is okay to deploy trunk to Pilot now. Please do so.

That said, there's now scheduled Pilot deployment time in place, so that there's less downtime for the client who uses pilot for testing. Please discuss how this will affect DSI deployment tomorrow with Joe. We might also allot specific times for DSI to do Pilot deployment.

Thanks,

Tai

Yes, Today I have deployed this to both pi-01 and pi-02 and tested SSO login. Seems it's working fine.

Thanks,

Okay, you can close out this ticket. We'll have this update sit on Pilot for a month or so.

I have put ISD-3852 in the backlog. That's the ticket for releasing this to Production. Whenever we want to start that initiative, I'll let you know.

Thanks,
