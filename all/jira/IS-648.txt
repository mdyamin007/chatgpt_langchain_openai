comment: [~Bryanl]: Can you help create a parallel for this job so that OPS can verify the in-house changes for the blank page is corrected. Please initiate the parallel so that we can run on Monday. We may be 1 to 2 days late on this project. Currently live date is set for 12/13. We may need to change it to 12/15 so that we complete parallel.



[~mahbubS]: FYI.

comment: [~mahbubS]/[~rony]: Live date is today (12/13/2021). I think [~mahbubS]may have been OOO. Please submit program transfer form and inform [~TunA]to release tomorrow instead (12/14/2021). This job runs once a month so thankfully missing today's live date would not be an issue.

comment: Hi [~William.Kong],

Generally I provide tranfer form after we get/submit the parallel form.

We didn't get any parallel form for this that's why I didn't provide tranfer form and do cvs checkin.

Today I will do cvs checkin and provide transfer form as you requested in your last mail.

Thanks


author: mahbubs
comment: Hi [~Peter.Dang],

Cvs checkin is done for this task.

Attached is the transfer form.[^IS_PROGRAM_TRANSFER_FORM-2.doc]

Parallel form is not given to me yet. So don't know should you release the code now or later.

[~Bryanl]please provide parallel form ticket ASAP.

Thanks
