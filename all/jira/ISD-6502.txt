Hi Keri,

I will not be able to make the pilot date today. Can we move the pilot date for this to Monday (2/28/2022)? I will be out of office Thursday and Friday.

Hi Keri, this is ready for Pilot, please have the client verify.

comment: Hi [~mac],

Here is the client's feedback; do you know how they can test this?

"I am still having difficulties viewing the preview or sending a sample (same issue that I reported in the first comment of this ticket). I'm not sure how we can verify the notices are displaying correctly. Please let me know."

Thank you,

Keri Y.

Hi Keri, so a preview of the email by pressing the Preview button has no issues. However, sending a sample there was an issue with it, but that has now been fixed. Can the client please try sending a sample?

comment: Hi [~mac],

Here is the client's new feedback:

"The sample is sending the email now, but it's still showing "$sdv_txt_acctNum" in the sample rather than XXXXX9999."

I have attached the screenshots with samples they received.

Thank you,

Keri

comment: Hi [~mac] - I don't believe this requires parallel so I think we are good to move to prod when you are ready.
