title: 39968 - HFCU New Client Setup - Document Processing Update
description: Document processing needs to be updated such that the AccountName field will truncate to exactly 100 characters if the account name is longer than 100 characters. The database table only support up to 100 characters. HFCU have accounts that have names longer than 100. 

Just need to update the DataHandler if I'm not mistaken.
