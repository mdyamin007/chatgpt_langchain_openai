There is no print sample available because the special character in the data file exist only for 1 account with "Hold Mail" address which is not available in print sample.

check account number:400020995 of letter 001 for an example.



letter 015 does not have e-statement according to SOW.

I asked DSI to confirm on Scrum, we are waiting on a response from them.  I see only one error in letter 015 from the production file. 


author: tohiduli
comment: Hi [~jharvey], [~Igor.Khosid]

the issue happened in the 015 letter but I updated all the letters in case this issue happens in other data files for other letter also. Should I only change the code for letter 015?
