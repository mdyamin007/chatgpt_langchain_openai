This is from the printer using eform, so no dpvs is needed.

Range is 1-20.

We could scan the print sample for client approval. OPs could update any encountered issue to ticket 23684.

Looks good to me, please send to client for approval.


author: william.kong
comment: [~dawnl]: Please ask client to provide their approvals no later than 11/29/2021 end of day. We have to schedule code release by 11/30 to not further delay this project in December code freeze period. In the meantime, I will update the target live date to be 11/30/2021.

Per Calvin, there is no need for client approval unless there were updates/changes made to the form overlays (front & back) per client request.  Were just adding the color e-forms to their Visa application to replace the current preprinted paper stock.  See comment #22 in TS #23684.
