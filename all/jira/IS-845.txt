Hi Thomas,
Could you please explain how you reprocessed the index file? 
We still see on the PUI the same record (04/05/2022 16:58:43). 
Yes, DataTrac shows now the entry on the Job Status tab. However, we cannot approve it, and noticed the exclamation points.

comment: [~thomasY]: please release tomorrow as scheduled and schedule a rollback date for 4/15/2022.



[~MattL]: Per my understanding with Thomas, this project is to process once and rollback. Please ensure communicating to Thomas after DP is done processing so that it can be rolled back after processing is done.


author: mattl
comment: Hi [~William.Kong]It may take more than one day to reprocess as there is a total of 12 files to run.


author: william.kong
comment: [~MattL]: Thanks for clarifying!

[~thomasY]: Let's target 4/21 as the code rollback date.
