title: Add "Delete" Feature to Source Code Repository System (IS-Dept)
description: There are several exercise we need to do for Brisbane move that involves updating code. However, as part of this exercise, there are tons of old code we are no longer using. This clutter is creating more and more overhead in researching.

So as we identify old code, we need to start deleting the code. Because we do not have this ability to delete, this is a ticket to add a 'delete' feature to our check in / check out wrapper script.

comment: Done with the standard files. Peter and I tested successfully.



However, we see that there are some files that does not follow standard names (ex. isisdisk.sh.log).



Updating the script to check if filepath is included, we do not need to get the filepath for those for those nonstandard files.



I am still working on a couple issues due midmonth. Will get this done by 3/31/2020, or earlier possible.
