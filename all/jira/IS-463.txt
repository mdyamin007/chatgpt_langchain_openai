comment: [~thomasY] also please let me know what letter code we are using for each letter as well as which type (A or B). 


author: thomasy
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima]It will be letters i and j. What do you mean by which type?


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~thomasY] for some reason MOCU has a unique enotice setup where by defining type A or B, we can reuse the same letter code to have two different enotice descriptions. They also use binary codes, so each letter code goes in sequence of 1,2,4,8,16, etc rather than 1,2,3,4,5. For example:

Letter 16:
A - Overdrawn Fee Letter
B - S13 New Checkcard Letter

Based on your comment tho, I think we are using type B given that 'H' seems to be the last enotice of this type. In which case, can you confirm if this is correct:

letter i (4096) - ACH NSF Return Notice 
letter j (8192) - Share Certificate Notice


author: thomasy
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima]Yes, that is correct.
