title: SURU [26671] [pvt] InfoTrac Fix
description: SURU InfoTrac Fix

My proposal to solve is to update the auth file. I think the file (Example: ml1_SURU_AUTH_03162022.txt) is coming from the print processing. Currently, there are 3 fields: account number, account name, and email address. I want another field for delivery preference. The value will be either be E for electronic and B for paper. On your side, if the NP value is PAPER, then you will include it in the eStatement index file for posting, and in the auth file, the delivery preference value will be B. For the current statements that are already in the eStatement index file, still include them in the index file, but in the auth file, the delivery preference field will have a value of E. This way, all the statements will be posted.
