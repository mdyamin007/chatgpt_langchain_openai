comment: [~phoebe.george] I've disabled the schedules for both the COOP and the accumulative paperless report, so we shouldn't be seeing those run anymore unless we decide to manually run it. Did you want me to also remove them entirely or is it fine to keep them but just have no schedule attached to it?

comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] Thanks! As discussed via Zoom chat, please keep these reports, just only remove the schedule attached to it; we'll be re-enabling in the future. Thanks!
