title: 5545 - BANB - Switch accounts to paper
description: None


author: admin
comment: I attached the file from the client. Ignore the other fields. Take only the account number and type field to find a match. If the account is on E, switch it back to paper.

Do some analysis on the accounts so the client will be aware how many of the accounts that they provided will be switched back to paper. Do this for both pilot and prod.
