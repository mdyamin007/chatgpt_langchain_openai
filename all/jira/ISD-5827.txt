Would it be possible to include some descriptions when turning over the story to QA?
Also, the structure of the stories is not providing an epic?
Please update the due date - all three stories were turned over to QA today, 11.24.2021. All available QA resources are already assigned to other projects

 * *Prevent batch download option for closed accounts.*

 # After clicking the batch download button, in the account number checkbox, the closed account can be selected to batch download its statements. It is prevented by hiding the checkbox if that account is closed.

*NOTE:*showClosedAcctStatement flags business is preserved i.e. if this flag is true, the closed account will behave like an active account(by showing the statements) and this accounts statements can be downloaded in batch.



Thanks

If two accounts are closed and flag = false I don't see batch download button and I can't go to batch download site - confirm if it correct.

But if one account is closed and another account is active, or both accounts are closed but for one account flag =false and for other account flag = true, then I have Batch Download button, and on Batch download page I can select closed account by checking checkbox - this is an issue

1. For closed account, batch download button will not show. This behavior is correct. (Unless "showClosedAcctStatement" flag is true)

2. There was some issues with Stage build. It is fixed now. Please, re-test again.

Thanks,

Azad

Azad, can you please check if BANB flag is still true, the banb accounts you provided have same behavior as if flag will be set to false. I have message 'This account has been closed since 01/01/1801. You have no access to this account since 03/02/1801' and I don't have Batch Download button for them

BANB flag (batchDownload) is still true. That means, you should see a "Batch Download" button if the selected account is active (i.e. not closed). And if the account is closed, the Batch Download button will not appear whether the flag is true or not.

You did not see Batch Download button for them because both of them were closed account. You can try again with the following data. One of them is active account. So, you should see Batch Download button for one of them. Also, in the batch download page, you will not able to download statements for the closed account. Only the active account can be selected to download statements on batch.
 * CIF_NUM:ABA9646
 * ACCT_NUMBER1:2005186419
 * TYPE1: DD
 * ACCT_NUMBER2: 2006020507
 * TYPE2: DD
 * USER_TYPE: P

Thanks
