Description of Work:

Fix bug where exist xml parser programming is pulling the subsequent joint owners middle name into the previous joint owners name.



Change logic to use the new xml2bar_parser_v3.py. The following is an example of the command line:

/home/master/xml2bar_parser_v3.py spcu_stmt_043022_1 /z/anwarH/spcums3/control/spcums3_template.control /d/iss/willK/cid/spcu/ts29067/spcu_stmt_043022_1.new multiprocessing=true



Replace the existing spcums3_template.control with the /z/anwarH/spcums3/control/spcums3_template.control

8353a9bd7921b6f24c37174ff3a1be83 spcums3_template.control

comment: [~Bryanl]: Per my comment on[IS-1089] SPCU - [28455][pvt] Include additional transaction narration for IRA accounts in Monthly Statements - Jira (infoimageinc.com), i will tentatively mark 6/13 as the live date to release both these projects.



Please review the "spcu_stmt.pdf" that [~thomasY]attached in this ticket. It has a few accounts for SPCU to review to make sure there is joint owner middle initial corrections we made are ok.



Thanks!

[~thomasY]--Attached above print sample is incorrect.
Can you send the request again to print that have the joint owners middle name in the statement

comment: [~gthillaivel]Those samples are for IS-1109. We didn't request samples for this.

Hi Gnana,



I discussed this with Igor yesterday, those print samples were mistakenly attached to this ticket and were for IS-1109. This is an in-house update that is just pending client approval for sample.


author: igor.khosid
comment: [~Bryanl] - I believe [~gthillaivel] is asking for the print samples reflecting the current updates 
[~thomasY] - let us know your opinion if the samples are needed


author: thomasy
comment: [~Igor.Khosid] [~gthillaivel]We should not need to check print samples for this update.

comment: [~thomasY]
Can you update IS checklist

comment: [~thomasY] - thank you

Per client: the samples look good for several accounts. I confirmed that the issue account looks good. Also confirmed that #1347305 S0001 is properly showing a middle initial. Based on these accounts, I approve the change and request you to move it to live

Thank you!
