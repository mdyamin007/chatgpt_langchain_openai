Hi[~abdullah.baki],

Sorry, I should have clarified. The download button is for statements. Each one should have its own download button. There is an issue currently on mobile devices where clicking on the statement link does not download the statements.

If possible, have it as an if else. If it's a browser, we have the statements as link. If it's mobile, we do not display them as link (the links wouldn't work) and have a download button instead.

Let's maybe use a download icon. I'll leave the UI design up to you.

Also, here is how you can test the mobile app:

The login name is "volunteer" and password is "Welcome2021!!".

Architect CERT - iOS: [https://install.appcenter.ms/orgs/architect-ps/apps/allsouth/distribution_groups/all-users-of-allsouth]



Some browser may prevent the download link from working, so make sure you try a few. I had success with Chrome.

Thanks,

Tai

Hi [~abdullah.baki],

There's a bit of a ui issue for mobile. How do I resolve this? I thought changing the % of the width for each td would work.

It is inside a mobile app, though, so maybe it's not resolvable. This is non-essential for now. But do let me know if you have any ideas.

Thanks,

Tai

Hi [~abdullah.baki],

On the iPhone, when using Safari, the download button downloads a file, but the statement show "There was an error getting the requested file". When the download prompt appear, it seems like it is downloading the file as closingdate.pdf.html instead of closingdate.pdf, which is the behavior for Chrome/Firefox/Edge on Android. I don't know if this is the issue.

I haven't tested with the other browsers on iPhone yet.

Thanks,

Tai

Hi [~tai.trinh],

I have fixed the issue for etax and enotice using the percentage so I think it will work with percentage. Updated the monthly list_inc logic for mobile, please have a look in the commit history.

I believe the downloading issue was an afp2web issue. Let me know if there is anything else.

Thanks,

Abdullah
