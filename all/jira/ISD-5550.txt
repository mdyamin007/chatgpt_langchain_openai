Hi Eric, I posted the file onto pilot. However, in the file, about half has account numbers and the other half doesn't. For the ones with the account numbers, their eTax are showing up.

The one without member number in index file are the ones without matches in xref file. If the ones posted are good, please post them on pilot for client to review.

Hi Igor, we are still working out some issues that we have ran into while moving the code onto stage. I'll update you when we are ready for you to test.
