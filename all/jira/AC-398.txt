title: WECU - [25044][pvt] RUSH fix of PromoBalTfr mapping
description: After further review we aren't going to ask for a new column. What we would actually like is the following:

*If you see an account feature called PromoBalTfr we want the balance subject to interest rate column amount mapped from the following location in the raw data file.*

<AccountFeature>

 <Name>PromoBalTfr</Name><CurrentBalance>

 <CurrentBalance>5827.66</CurrentBalance>

*All other account feature names will continue to map to*

<AccountFeature>

<Name>

<Balances>

<Balance Type="Average Daily Balance" Amount=" " />
