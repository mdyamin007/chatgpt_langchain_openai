comment: Hi [~Peter.Dang]

Can you help with this issue? The pdf sample has the correct font with bold but the html sample is not producing the same font. Please see the attached image. Is there anything we can do to fix it?

comment: [~tohidulI] [~Andrey.Kutsenko] Customer also viewed these on InfoTrac pilot site, so the posted version if good to proceed as is without the bolding. I will inform the client. 

[~Peter.Dang] We still want to try and confirm though why there is a discrepancy for future notices for setup. However, this bug is not a show-stopper in order for us to move forward.
