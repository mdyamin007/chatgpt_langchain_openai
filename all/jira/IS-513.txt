comment: Hi [~eric.yan]Will samples be ready today?

The sample is ready for review.


author: william.kong
comment: [~MattL]: Please see if we can get approvals before eod today. We will need to check with QA if they can rush this.

[~Igor.Khosid]: FYI. Live date is tomorrow. First round of samples was provided yesterday and client is reviewing. According to this timeline live date is tomorrow (10/28)

Thank you Will

The first-round sample has never been provided to QA for review. Why are we not following our workflow?


author: eric.yan
comment: [~Igor.Khosid]

The sample was first provided yesterday on 10/26. We are trying to do both client approval and QA simultaneously to meet the live day tomorrow 10/28.

The job only has verbiage change and we could bypass parallel.

I've exported the project to qa\EPCU\EPCUDL038.zip

I'm assigning the ticket to myself, so when it ready, I'll start on this

Please be sure to change the status to Waiting for QA and this should be done before submitting for the client review


author: william.kong
comment: [~MattL]: We have not received confirmed approval last night. Live date of today is not feasible. Depending on when QA finishes and when client provides approvals, we will need to reschedule on our next availability.


author: mattl
comment: Client Approved today.

Since it's only verbiage, please let me know if physical print is needed. The letter format or spacing didn't get change.

William, per Igor we should be able to pass QA shortly. No print samples required, no parallel required, just pending release once QA provide offical approval we should be ready for release this evening/or tomorrow if possible.

comment: Hi [~eric.yan]unfortenly the client sent us the test data filing using Comma delimiter:
