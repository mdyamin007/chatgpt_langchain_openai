title: Demo Upgrades - Sales Request
description: This epic is to address the list that James and Sales have come up with to update and upgrade the demo for them to use.


||Request||Date of Start||Est. Date of Completion||Completed||
|Responsive Web Portal||||
|Improved design and banner add design and placement||||
|update documents dates i.e. not 2014 but 2020/2021||||
|Ability to show combined statements which could be tied to multiple accounts||||
|Ability to show a joint statement (husband/wife scenario)||||
|Online proofing has not been updated in the static demo||||
|Create sample reports||||
|Transfer statement should show more than 1 document||||
|InfoDocs needs to be updated||||
|Batch Download to Show 24 documents||||
|Banner ads do not show in the pilot infotrac||||

Providing context for above - it shows really well when I can show a responsive web portal - go in and add a banner ad or change - log back in to web portal and it displays new banner ad.
