comment: [~premraj.patil]: Can you help me check why I cannot RDP to ISD production input server. My Brisbane IS Jumpstation (10.4.20.127) is in the same subnet as ISD input server (10.4.20.20).



[~kent.chan]: FYI.

Its a Linux server (ca-input-pr-01). You have to ssh in to it.

Thanks!

comment: [~premraj.patil]: Thanks Prem. Current this production version of input server in Menlo is windows. However, ISD has changed to Linux to Brisbane.  David clarified last Thursday that it is Linux. I'll close this ticket out.
