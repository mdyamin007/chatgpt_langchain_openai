comment: [~fahad] Pilot has been approved for IRA and HSA. Note that eTaxes from other Jira ticket is still pending approval.

I will schedule internal turnover together, but please prepare for QA when ready. I'll work with [~Igor.Khosid] to get this scheduled and set a new live date. Will change it to 4/22/22 for now.

Thank you,

comment: Hi [~phoebe.george],
Isn't HSA/IRA both supposed to go live at the same time? It seems tax (IS-932) and this both have different live date now.

I Contacted the ISD team ( [~Azad] ), He let me know that the code hasn't been released in stage yet. That's why you are facing this error. I'll let you know as the team release it to stage ASAP.
Thanks.

It missed the due date. Are we waiting for star taxes to finish up so that we can move both of them to production together?
Thanks.

Thank you!
