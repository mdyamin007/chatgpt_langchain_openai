title: CENT - [31539][pvt][in-house] Commercial Loan Need Approval Status in ETA Board
description: -----------------per Fahad------------------------------

I've turned off the AOLP. Also re-ran the process in Pilot and Parallel.
Please have a check. If everything is alright then request Tun to release.
I'm attaching the transfer form and also did the cvs check in. Resource is in my xfer directory ( /d/is/cvs/xfer/fahadK/centml1.control )



I've checked already. It seems everything is alright. I don't think DP needs to check anything.
