comment: [~yameelee]/[~Peter.Dang]: I understand this is an in-house project. If you are too tied up, please update the Due Date to next year so that it does not look past due.

comment: [~Igor.Khosid]I exported the house #10 and 6X9 to qa/ENVELOPE/

Please take a look and see if you have any questions.

We do not have the specs for the heavy env and the house #9.

comment: Hi [~yameelee] please advise.
Why do we have a specification for printing a return address (see attach file 'Preprint Paper Specifications.pdf'), the Tap Test sometimes Fails (like [here|https://jira.infoimageinc.com/browse/IS-734?focusedCommentId=42467&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-42467])?

Sometimes the logo is bigger or smaller etc and programmer didn't check the actual specifications or is not sure. So that's why Peter wants to have this project and he wanted the programmers to use these 2Ds to check the envelope windows before it gets to QA.


author: JIRAUSER11104
comment: Thank you [~yameelee]. This is a good idea.
Tell me pls, how I can these 2Ds in projects, which are exported to the QA folder.
