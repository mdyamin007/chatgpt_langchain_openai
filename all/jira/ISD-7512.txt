comment: [~eric.yan] On the Pilot Site, there are duplicate copies of the forms that are displaying. I saw that they were posted twice on the Pilot PUI - can you pull down the first set?

Thanks,

comment: [~eric.yan] Just wanted to check if possible to pull down the original set of eTaxes. The customer is in pilot site review and wanted to confirm that we are truly only posting one set of eTaxes for each of the forms. Thank you!

Is there any update from the client?

comment: Hi [~eric.yan] ,

As per [~phoebe.george] please note we are pending a new xref file from SUCU due to the number of exceptions when posting their last file

Thank you,
