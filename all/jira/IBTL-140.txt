comment: [~rodriguez]: Can you review this brisbane{color:#00875a}*production*{color} testing issue?


author: rodriguez
comment: [~William.Kong]: Looking into it


author: rodriguez
comment: [~William.Kong]: same issue as IBTL -138


author: william.kong
comment: [~rodriguez]: You are right. That ticket IBTL-138 is global issue on RH2.

I did not create the zip directory correctly. RHS2:/d/zip local and not shared. RH2 & RHS /d/zip was shared. I fixed it now.



[~Velasco]: Can you please retest?

comment: Looks like it went all the way through this time around with the exception of the high cripple.

Everything is Ok
My commercial CD Maillist = dp@infoimageinc.com
comm_cd_clean_up_set4(): My CID = eqbk ; My JID = ms1
/d/pdf_afp/eqbk/eqbkms1/eqbkms1_comm_cd_cripple_rpt.dat
Cripple for CD is greater than 5%

Can you work with Surekha on this. Look like there are 404 error in the tomcat log.

comment: Bryant,

      Looks like prism is calling the non-html version of the wrapper service. Is the updated code deployed on prism ? Please check wrapper service url in the api.props file and match it with what we have on production.



Below is the request : We should not have /pdf in the url

comment: Hi Surekha,

The fix has been fixed. I built i3-core on prism-pr-02 since it was using code prior to the HTML document code. It looks good now.
