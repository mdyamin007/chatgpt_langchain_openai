title: GCBK Return Mail Two Reports
description: Gate city is seeing the possibility of having more than weekly reports for Return Mail Processing what is the effort level to make this "custom"?

comment: We discussed this with Sr. Management and have discussed that this will be a possibility. But it really depends on the data/volume etc. that we receive. It is not up to us when we receive this mail so the frequency of the report may have data but it also may not have data.
