The Account Analysis statements are still using the year of 2021 when it should be 2022. I can confirm they are all are wrong on analysis statements from 1/31/22. I have an example in the attachment for your review. Please notify when the change is made going forward and if there a way to prevent this from happening next year? Thanks!

For account analysis statement date, program has the end date as end month, end day, and begin year. Will need to make update to use end year for this date.



Dawn please create a programming request for DSI. Per Peter, it would need to go through QA and sample approval process.
