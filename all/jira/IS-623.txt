Please see client feedback below:

The date is incorrect on the "your credit score box" for the credit rate increase letters. It should be 9/8/21 based on the file we uploaded but the box has 12/15/21 in error.

See attached template showing where the data should come from, the original spreadsheet we uploaded showing the rate change date for the file, and a snip of one of the sample notices.

Please fix this error and send updated samples.

comment: [~Kbittmann]: Approval date of 2/21 is missed.. Please advise if we can get approvals today to squeeze parallel in before we go live by 2/28. If not, then project will be on hold and we will need to re-assign a new developer for this project in a couple of weeks.



Thanks!
