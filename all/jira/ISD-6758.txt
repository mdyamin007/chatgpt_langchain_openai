title: 27840 - GCBK - Emails did not send out
description: None


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: Triggered emails at 5pm for all loans, escrow, and enotice email jobs not containing any Non-sufficient Funds (NSF) notices between 3/15 and 3/25. Enotice index files containing NSF were split into two (one with, one without NSF notices) and reposted so that we can send out emails for all notices that were not NSF notices (001, 017, and 019).

All non NSF notice emails should send out at 10pm.
