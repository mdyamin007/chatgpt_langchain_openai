comment: Hi [~jharvey],

1. Which daily letter applications are these letters being added to? apcudlc, apcudle, apcudld?

2. If the new letter is added toapcu_dn_<mmddyy>_<segment>.zip.pgp for apcudlc application, will the structure be something like below? Please ask customer to send the test files zipped and encrypted.

apcu_dn_<mmddyy>_<segment>.zip.pgp

  ->LossMit-BRP_mmddyy.zip.pgp

    -> LossMit-BRP_082521.txt
  ->21-31_day_letter_mmddyy.zip.pgp

    -> 21-31_day_letter_mmddyy.txt

comment: [~jun]& [~TunA]: I'm still waiting to get the specs updated. But in the meantime, please continue progress on the format step. Most likely we can probably get an extension to 11/15.

[https://app.na3.teamsupport.com/?TicketNumber=22308]

We most likely will be using apcudle processing program instead.

Please remind me or Tun on Wednesday's scrum meeting to see if get the final specs if I forget to discuss during the meeting.

comment: Hi [~jharvey],

There is usually a current date field in the data file that's used for archival and enotice posting. However, "apcu_21-31_day_letter_082321.txt" doesn't have current date field. Can customer advise what date I should use instead?


author: jharvey
comment: [~jun]

Please see the client's response below. Please let me know if we need to try to do something different.



Since this file comes directly out of FICS we don't have the ability to add fields in. But let's use the date within the file name as it should be one in the same.

Does that work?


author: jun
comment: [~jharvey]Yes, the date from filename will work.
