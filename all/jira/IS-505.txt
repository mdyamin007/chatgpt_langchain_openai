comment: [~Bryanl]: Did we get approvals for this project? Live date is today. Based reviewing the comments, I don't believe we have approvals. Please advise status on this project. Ideally if we need to revise the timeline, live date needs to be on or before 11/30/2021. Any dates after 11/30/2021 will need to wait until next year.

comment: [~Bryanl]: Any updates on this this? Per my comment above, live date of 11/17 is missed. I will tentatively mark the live date to be 11/30; Please be advise, if we are late again after 11/30, most like we will not resume until February 2022. Please advise client of this expectation.
