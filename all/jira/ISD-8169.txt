title: DACB - [34044][pvt] New Disclosure for eStatement
description: This is for the unenrollment route where we need to update the disclosure, unenroll all users, and then having users log in as a "new" user so they have to accept the new disclosure.

*Note*: On production, generate a full external enrollment report right before unenrolling all users so that the client has the report as reference for who was enrolled previously.


Tentative timeline:

Turnover: 11/16

Pilot: 11/21

Client pilot approval: 11/28

Turnover to QA: 11/30

Live: 12/07

comment: [~eric.yan] Can you assist with updating their enrollment disclosure with the final esign disclosure provided attached to this story? Their current disclosure is in html format so we would need to convert the new one from pdf to html.

comment: notes:

unenroll all users:
 # get the external enrollment report before unenrolling all users.
 # change SSO date to null. (usr_session).
 # change in auth file acct-user relation will switch account to paper (client aware).
