Client just provided a couple updates for this:

1.I haven't been able to find anyone who has an update internally on this ticket. No one has made any mention that Delinquency Notices are not producing correctly.

Can we continue to monitor and address if this comes up again? Without anyone being able to provide additional knowledge or context, I'm not sure where to even begin.

Based on the samples you sent me back in April, it looks like we have moved to general delinquency notices--not specific to Consumer, HELOC or Mortgage. Would you be able to confirm? (Please see attached InfoImage Samples_Delinquency Notice 14 Days (001).pdf andInfoImage Samples_Delinquency Notice 27 Days (001).pdf)



2.I have a case where a Direct Unsecured Consumer Loan account output from the LN_LATE to a mortgage delinquency notice template. Not sure the frequency or the mapping but this loan should not have output to a mort. del. notice. Thank you and let me know if you need additional information (Please see attachedUFCUClient24899Screenshot.png)
