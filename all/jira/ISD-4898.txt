comment: [~kdishroon], the visa backer is updated on pilot SSO. I attached two images of the new visa backer with the pilot url included (visabacker_pilot_1.PNG and visabacker_pilot_2.PNG). I believe they should have SSO pilot access, but if not then we can provide these screenshots to them.

comment: Thanks Keri, I've moved the update to stage.

Hi [~Igor.Khosid], can you help verify the visa backer is updated on stage SSO? Below are instructions:

SSO test page: Use q2sso Hypercube
orgId: 5844
Everything else can remain the same/filled in as usual

Upon login, at the top please click on the Reconciliation tab and then click on 'Visa Statement Reconciliation'. The new visa backer should display. For reference, I've attached the old backer (old_visa_backer.pdf) and the new backer (new_visa_backer.pdf). 

May need host file entry for this, let me know if there are any issues with SSO and I can provide it.

Thanks,
Shun

comment: [~kdishroon] as I requested on spark, Visa backer on the member site was released to production today. I think I can close out this ISD ticket, as well as Tye's ticket, once parallel is all passed.
