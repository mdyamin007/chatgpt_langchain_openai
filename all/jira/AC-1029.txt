title: EQBK - [34838][pvt][in-house] DP - EQBK Daily Letter #25.01 / Processing Error
description: Can you release the EQBKDL015.dfa and EQBKDL015.prj? I have attached the transfer form.



A special character in the address line causing the contents of paper index file shift 1 character to the right. I have updated the program to replace that character with empty. Please see comment 3 and have an onshore developer to release the updated code.
