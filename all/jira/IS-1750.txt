comment: Hi [~Andrey.Kutsenko],

Previously we thought that we have to enablenew_e_index flag, but later we noticed that the index file was in old style in production. That's why we don't need to update the control file.

We ran the code in pilot. Actually initially we provide the pdf sample and after client approval we provide the index file and etc. Please provide the index file to client to approve. If client approve the index file then we will provide the parallel id and update the procs file. But If you need the parallel ID before client approval then we will provide.
