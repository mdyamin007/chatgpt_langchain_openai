title: Update Disclaimer to InfoTRAC - 14830
description: Tyler - We currently don't have "User Agreement" language for InfoTRAC. Eric had agreed to upload after updating InfoTRAC UI; however, the project was never completed with DSI. Per Jessica, we need a pretext to request click agree to the disclaimer since this was never done during the inception of InfoTRAC. Per David, if there are annual updates or system updates, then this would be good way introduce the disclaimer language when client signs on (one time) and "agree to the terms of usage." See first draft of User Agreement language.



Per David, I should also open this ticket and assign this to you as part of PD project.



Thanks
