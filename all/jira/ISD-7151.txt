 # I have resolved the issue. It is deployed on PILOT and tested on both DEV and PILOT environments. It's working fine now. Please have a look.
 # The issue was related to frontend. A javascript if condition was restricting assigning new data to a vue-store data "npId". That's why using the same browser or multiple tabs was creating this issue as the value remained the same. It was only happened for newly created users who don't have any record on notification_preference table. If any user didn't find any notification preference, then it was using the cached value which produced this issue.
 
 You were asking about using account management v2 with multiple tabs. Actually we don't have that support to use multiple accounts on multiple tabs. When you search for an account, our frontend is populated by data from APIs which is stored in a temporary storage called vue-store. So when you searched for a different account from the same browser, APIs are called again and vue-store refreshed with those new data. That's why you can only use one account at once from a browser. We can't also use other modules for instance message manager in multiple tabs.

3. And we also cross checked if there is any cross communication of data between tabs or browsers. We found none. Everything looks fine.
