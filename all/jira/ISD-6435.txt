Hello,

We are still waiting for network team to finish things on their end before we can do the Internal QA.

Hi Igor, this is just a heads up, we were suppose to have the QA team QA SLCU's Hypercube site on Pilot. However, this will be delayed as we are still waiting on the network team to finish things on their end before the QA process can happen. I will keep you updated.

I'm turning this over to QA. This is ready for QA on pilot.

comment: Verified on pilot member site, no issues, ready for client review

Note:

SLCU SSO does not have enrollment process and profile page.

Thank you,

Natasha

comment: [~mac] client says:

When we looked into this change it was our understanding that the 
process for the SSO shouldn't change, just the URL. From the 
information below it looks like the request format has changed. I'll 
share the information with Connect but due to this being a larger change 
than just the URL I'm not sure how quickly they're going to be able to 
accommodate the update. Stay tuned! Take Care

Hi Igor, SLCU's Hypercube Migration is ready to be QA'd on staging.

When you SSO into the eStatement portal, the URL should be:*https://slcustage.infoimageinc.com/*

I will be out on 9/23 and 9/26, if you have any questions please let Sean know, or leave them here.
