title: NCOA Not Working
description: [~William.Kong]: NCOA fails to process. Hang at one point for a long time and ssh connection got lost after a while. Nothing saved to log. Here is the command:

/home/test/master/ncoa_process.sh idcums131 idcu idcums1 /z/idcu/idcums131 idcums1

Not sure if I should assign this to Ernest. So I assigned to you for now. Please distribute to the right person. Thanks



Update: I ran just the command above and it seems to work fine. Not sure why it wasnt working yesterday when I ran the entire processing script. Let me try again....

[~William.Kong]NCOA is working. Now there's this error. Please let me know if you want me to create another ticket for this.

Will: The DB error looks to be corrected, and NCOA seems working. I could see the DPVS now. However, there's another different error about ssh to Texas server to copy print files. Please see below:



/home/test/master/cp_to_texas.sh idcu /z/idcu/idcums131
where /z/afp/idcu
prefix idcums131
cid idcu
fn /z/idcu/idcums131
jobid 91f
ssh: connect to host texas port 22: Connection timed out

comment: [~tient]:  Ferhat is able open up the ssh port. This means we should be able to copy files from Brisbane to Texas via SSH (i.e. scp).
