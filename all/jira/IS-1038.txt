Can you please drop the sample in the client pickup folder? The client can't find it.

Please see the below note from the client:

Thank you, I think this should work for the report. What would the frequency be for generating it? Will it be daily or can we have it run once a month with a recap of all the suppressed accounts?

Any update on the last question posed?

comment: [~Kbittmann]: DSi is still on holiday since last Thursday morning. They are schedule to return tonight. Hopefully he can respond either tonight or the following day after they are all caught up.



[~tohidulI]: I'm assuming the frequency of this report will be available towards the end of running the WECU Loan Bill processing program right? (i.e. at the end of each cycle).



For sure we will+not+ accumulate a monthly report as our typical SOP is to generate report after each cycle is completing processing towards the end.



Thanks!
