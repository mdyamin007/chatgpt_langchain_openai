title: SACU - [31246] [pvt] Daily Notice Fix for Delinquent Notice Files
description: Permanent change to modify script to check to see if there are any 2nd or 1st Delinquent letters within the Delinquent file AND then create the .dat files accordingly. This will prevent the program from failing each time the customer sends a Delinquent file that contains only one type of Delinquent letter (1st or 2nd).



Update logic letters 6 and 7 (Overdrawn Letters) as well (as it currently follows the same logic).



NOTE: Based on error message tied to ticket #31246: This failure is due to the logic in the script. The script arbitrarily looks for the Delinquent file and creates two .dat files, one for letter 2 and one for letter 3. These .dat files are then fed into Papyrus for formatting. Since there were no 2nd Delinquent letters, the formatting step produced an empty txt and the process failed.



Start date is 8/8/22

Live date is 8/10/22
