author: phoebe.george
comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] Can you load this additional resource for IVBK eNotices for production?

[~Tin.Chak] FYI per our zoom chat.


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~phoebe.george] resource should be uploaded now.

comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] Thank you!

One more request from DSI:
||Hi [Phoebe George|https://jira.infoimageinc.com/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=phoebe.george]
can you have isd to enable auto trigger for this file pattern *"ivbk_1342.\d\{4}.\d\{7}.(CK_NSFNT\|TD_NOTE\|DP-OVDFT).STM.pgp"*?|

comment: [~Shun.Kuwashima] Sorry, one more request in additional to above - based on the previous resource that I sent yesterday, can you replace with the attached from DSI instead?

Thanks!

[^IVBKTS3.TIF]

comment: [~phoebe.george] I've added the file pattern to our scanner for print onto all scanner environments.

I noticed the recent resource attached is named IVBKTS3-1.TIF, however the existing one is IVBKTS3.TIF. Should the name actually be IVBKTS3.TIF? Just wanted to make sure since it's a lot easier if the replaced resource is the same name as the previous one so that we don't have to physically go into every server and remove the old different named resource.

replace the existing IVBKTS3.TIF file.


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~tohidulI] so can we rename the IVBKTS3-1.TIF to IVBKTS3.TIF and then reupload? Just wanted to confirm these aren't two separate resources.


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~tohidulI] I've updated the name from IVBKTS3-1.TIF to IVBKTS3.TIF and replaced the existing IVBKTS3.TIF, so the resource is updated now.

[~phoebe.george] Can you remove both resources from this story? I can readd the updated resource afterward, just want to avoid further confusion. Thanks

comment: I see on IS-1613 that code was released a couple days ago. Resource is updated on production, nothing else to release. Closing story.
