comment: My apologies Tohid, I just realized the question below was from you, not Igor,  on storing approved samples. I think in the future, I will have to work with BA to have approved samples moved to an "Approved Samples" folder on Secure Share . 

_Hi Andrea Vargas

Please provide parallel form also. Normally we run script multiple times so the older sample get replaced. Going forward will it be possible for you to save the sample we send to client? So that we can provide that sample when we turn over to QA._

comment: Tohid, what is the print range for the sample request?



author: ratnam
comment: Hi Igor,



Mtg Stmt - Current Loan. pdf includes mapping for Mortgage Statement.

Mortgage Statement Delinquency Box.pdf includes Mortgage Statement with just Delinquency section mapping.

Construction Bill Statement Example.pdf includes Mortgage Statement mapping for construction loans. The only difference is in the Account Information Section with additional fields and mapping.



Please let me know if you have any questions.



Thanks
