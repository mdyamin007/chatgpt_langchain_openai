title: DT_JOB_ID Auto Creation from PC Dept
description: Per IS/OPS Meeting, they have implemented a procedure to create all the DT_JOB_IDs automatically for most of the applications;  The one-off application still requirement to manually request PC.  The action item is to review the results on what PC did to confirm if indeed what we requested is helpful.  If so, then we should share this info to all the other departments.  Please bare in mind that we have to Query the DataTRAC database in parallel to get all the available DT_JOB_IDs.
