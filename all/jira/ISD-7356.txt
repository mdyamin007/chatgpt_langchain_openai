description: UTCU - Setup eSelective inserts for Statements

*Description:* Setup eSelective inserts for Statements. The eSelective inserts will show on Account Management but not on Job status. The eSelective Inserts will request a selective insert account list to work

*Note: Currently, no selective insert account list and criteria in format program in current production process, This assessment is only for account list provide by client.*

*Timeline:*
 * Work Order Approval Date: 07/05/2022
 * Sample Date: 08/08/2022
 * Sample Approval Date: 09/23/2022 
 * Live date: 09/30/2022
 * Parallel required: (Yes)

*IS Assessment*
=============
Engineering resource:

Assessment Details (IS):
- Parallel required: (Yes)
- setup e-selective inserts for following applications
- ** No selective insert account list and criteria in format program in current production, This assessment is only for account list provide by client.
Monthly Statement (utcuums2)
- General e-selective insert steps:
1. define "eStmtSelInsFlag" in control file
2. Update insert file
3. Make sure PC has this feature enable
4. Make sure ISD has this feature enable
5. In insert managment tab, PC or AC need to fill out some information and upload a pdf insert to test either pilot or staging
6. Make sure SOW is updated

comment: [~barnetts] I need to reject this ticket. The description doesn't match the ticket. There's no ISD assessment either.

comment: Hi [~Tin.Chak],

Can you please advise if ISD needs to assess this? 

Thanks, Barnett

comment: [~barnetts] Yes, we need to enable e-selective inserts on our end and also testing/validation. Please add 2 hours. We can follow IS timeline. Also, please correct the description.

comment: Hi [~Shun.Kuwashima]

It is updated.

Thanks, Barnett

comment: Enabled selective e-insert flag on lower environments.

Enabled selective e-insert flag on lower environments, can you please advise if QA needs to check this?

comment: Hi [~barnetts], I need the index file from IS to test whether selective inserts works.


author: barnetts
comment: Thank you [~Shun.Kuwashima],

[~Natalie.Tom], can you please provide the index file to test whether selective inserts works when you can? 

Thanks, Banrett

comment: [~barnetts] I did some further research and turns out UTCU is on an older setup, so it requires programming updates to their member site in addition to the configuration update. I'm not sure if we can make the initial live date, I'll need to see what we can do.

[~Tin.Chak] I'm not sure why, but I think I mistakenly added this into our sprint without proper assessment. UTCU is still on prism so selective insert setup requires code change too. Can you advise on how we should proceed? 


author: 5b1ee5a72eea651bacdeca2e
comment: [~barnetts] Can we move the timeline by 1 week due this? There were some unforeseen update that we need to do.

[~Shun.Kuwashima] I'll have DSI work on the update on the Prism side. Is everything else ready?


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~Tin.Chak] We are still pending the index file from IS in order to verify, however I already made the conf file updates to all lower environments. Insert feature is also enabled on Infoconfig. Besides the changes on the Prism side, I don't think there is anything else we need to update.


author: barnetts
comment: Hi [~Shun.Kuwashima] / [~Tin.Chak],

I will move the timeline 2 weeks, so you don't feel rushed. I rather be safe than sorry. Thank you for catching this and doing extra research.

Thanks, Barnett

I've implement eselective insert update for UTCU(prism) on dev and pilot. Please notify me if you post the index file on lower environments so that the code can be tested.

comment: Thanks [~Azad], currently still waiting for an index file from IS to test, I will let you know once we receive one from them.

Can you post: /z/isd_input_dev/I3/process-files/utcu/ms2_20220630_1_20220810_1453_utcu.txt?


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~Natalie.Tom] I was able to post it successfully onto stage and view on infotrac stage, however this involves code updates on the member site which DSI made up to pilot. Usually we don't move code over to stage until it is approved by the client on pilot. Can you replicate this process onto pilot?

comment: [~Natalie.Tom] [~barnetts] any updates on this? Due date 8/12 is passed, please provide a new due date if possible. Thanks


author: barnetts
comment: Hi [~Shun.Kuwashima] / [~Natalie.Tom],

The due date has been moved to 8/26.

Thanks, Barnett


author: barnetts
comment: HI [~Natalie.Tom] / [~lemoy28] / [~TunA],

Both applications (Stmt and eAccount analysis ) are treated as separate jobs
Please provide a new timeline as well. 

Thanks, Barnett

comment: Hi [~Natalie.Tom],

Householding looks to be added per JEF # 44302 by Lai / Tien on 03/31/2021
Per Alex from DP, because the files are running late. the jobs are ran separated so that might be why Householding wasn't applied. 


Thanks, Barnett 


author: JIRAUSER11103
comment: [~TunA] [~lemoy28]
From the last comment, it seems like they aren't treated separate jobs and just that files were running late so the application still has householding.


author: shun.kuwashima
comment: [~barnetts] [~Natalie.Tom] Are we still proceeding with this update? If so, please provide new due dates since 8/31 has passed.


author: barnetts
comment: Hi [~Shun.Kuwashima] / [~Natalie.Tom] / [~TunA] / [~lemoy28],

The job is currently on hold while we wait for UTCU response.

Thanks, Barnett
