Sometimes we need to convert a lot of pseg at a time. In this case it is very tidious and time consuming to use the Papyrus image editor to convert all the pseg.
In this case we can use the help of /isis/psel3700/pic/psel3pic in preprocessing02.
There is already some scripts that are being used to convert tif images to pseg, such as,
${home_master}/master/pseg_conv.sh
${home_master}/master/conv_pseg_to_fs10.sh
In this post we are going to provide a basic conversion approach. And we only worked on tif image to pseg conversion so far. If you have worked on any other image format, then please do share.
The script "psel3pic" needs a file as profile which contains all the configuration of pseg conversion.
The profile file extension is ".icd".
Try to find template icd files in ${home_master}/master/ directory.
I generally used the base_pseg.icd file for normal color tif image conversion.
If you want to reduce the quality (but still printable for b/w) of the image after conversion, then you can use base_pseg_fs10.icd. You will need to use base_pseg_fs10.icd in case if the tiff file is generating bigger size for base_pseg.icd.
In the icd file PICResolution and PPMFPP value should be "300" and PICDitherMax should be "1024". This is infoimage convention.
You can play around with other variables for experiment purpose.
You will notice that, in base icd files, PPMFInputName and TargetName variables are missing.
PPMFInputName should contain the input tif file name with full path.
TargetName should contain the output pseg file name with full path.
You need to create your own icd file and add these two variables with their values.
You need to run the below code in your /t/test_{username}.sh when your icd file is ready. Suppose your icd file is in $cur_icd_name variable. Then you should assign it to "profile" in below command.
ssh -o BatchMode=yes $LOGNAME@preprocessing02 ". /home/control/daily.control; . /etc/profile; /isis/psel3700/pic/psel3pic /profile=$cur_icd_name >>${log_name} 2>;&1"
For TKCUDL039 project i did the following:
#TKCU01
main_tif_name="Primary"
data_dir="/z/download/pseg_conv_test/res_300/"
template_icd_name="/z/download/pseg_conv_test/base_pseg_fs10_0322.icd"
for filename in ${data_dir}/*tif
do
    # echo "Tiff file name: ${filename##*/}"
    cur_tif_num=`echo ${filename##*/} | cut -d '_' -f2 | cut -d '.' -f1`
    cur_tif_num_padded=$(printf "%02d" $cur_tif_num)
    cur_icd_name="${data_dir}/base_pseg_TKCU${cur_tif_num}.icd"
    # echo "Tiff num: ${cur_tif_num}"
    cp $template_icd_name $cur_icd_name
    ppmf="PPMFInputName=${data_dir}${main_tif_name}_${cur_tif_num}.tif"
    echo $ppmf >> $cur_icd_name
    target="TargetName=${data_dir}S1TKCU${cur_tif_num_padded}.300"
    echo $target >> $cur_icd_name
# log_name="${data_dir}base_pseg_TKCU${cur_tif_num_padded}.log"
# ssh -o BatchMode=yes $LOGNAME@preprocessing02 ". /home/control/daily.control; . /etc/profile; /isis/psel3700/pic/psel3pic /profile=$cur_icd_name >>${log_name} 2>;&1"
# done
