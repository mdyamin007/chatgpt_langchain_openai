Daily letters are small notices that the Bank or CU wants to send to its customers periodically(Daily, weekly, etc..). Compared to other statements, usually the holds at most 1-2 page with small amount information in them. They also usually don't have elements like transactions, checks, check images, etc.
Each daily project has multiple smaller statements. Those are referred to as 001,002,003,004...
You will find them in the SOW like this,
Work Flow:
Data File:
Each of those latter may have multiple data files or a single data file that contains all notices data.
If they need multiple data files, their data file naming conventions can be also found in the SOW.
On the other hand, if the data file comes as a single file, then it needs to be run using some kind of preprocessing script to split it into multiple data files for each notice.
Write-Record/E-Statement Index:
Unlike other statements, Daily dfas only generate print write records. They don't generate e-statement index files themselves. In other words, daily dfa will always generate print writerecord for both 's' and 'f' options. So dont add any job sel filter on paper write record
As there are multiple dfas in daily projects, multiple writerecord file will be generated. Later they will get merged in the processing script as you will see and proceed from there but afp files not gets merged. write record keep track afp based on letter code and afp code.
Ultimately all of the individual daily will be treated as a single project by the processing script.
Example Write-Record file:
Format Step / Print DFA:
As mentioned before, the afp output from each individual daily notices gets combined. This is done using the Daily print step dfa.
