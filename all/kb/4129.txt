Material code is used for the type of physical stock. 4000s are used for inhouse plain white cutsheet paper and each number uniquely represent the perforation or 3ole pattern on the paper. 7000s are used for inhouse plain continuous-feed
roll paper. 7000s paper do not have perforation or 3hole. Any material codes other than the 4000s and 7000s are for non-inhouse paper.
Stock code is used for the following purposes:
To determine what recipe code to use for the page. Recipe code controls whether perforation is needed and the position of the perforation. It also controls whether 3hole punch is
neededEach preprinted paper has a non-4000 stock codeFor color jobs printed on the color printer, stock code is also used to identify the page design. Laser operators checks that against the work order to make sure that it is printing
with the correct version
Note:
4000s can be used for
both material code and stock code because each 4000 stock has certain perforation or 3hole pattern, as well as the recipe code predefined already7000s are for material codes
only and they should never be used for stock codes. We need to assign different stock codes to control the different recipe codes for different applications printing on those roll stocks
