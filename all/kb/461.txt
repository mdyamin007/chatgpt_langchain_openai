tax spec handle script
tax_process.sh is the main file,
prepare_data_file.sh( main/starting script)
Account type is in field 6in e-index in etax index file , in dfa it is from (781-785) column, or 1042s it is from ( 1021, 1025)
for 1042s ssn starts from record Q, column 349 length 9, for rest of the forms starts from record B column 12 length 9
for 1042s account starts from record Q, column 72 length 20, for rest of the forms starts from record B column 21 length 20
normally when we put new account/member no in irs data file we put the no in record Q column 1031 length 20 for 1042s and record B column 751 length 20 for rest of the forms.
