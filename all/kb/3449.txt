Normally "segment", "bypass" must be needed.
"job_sel" is optional. if job_sel is not given then all the options will be taken by default.
Example:
This is ok.
sh -x $home_master/master/hfcums2_process.sh 2 bypass
missing segment bypass
The convention is the 1st argument is segment and 2nd is bypass ( 1 or 0 ). If any of those 2 arguments is missing script should abort
