Hi Neil/Rogelio,
In case you don't see Rony's request in JEF #48034. Could you please help DSI for sample process? DSI cannot create DVD sample output.
Would you please run the ffinms2_process.sh script in parallel for commercial cd and get the sample to the client. As you already know this relates to ticket 17904 and jef description also has the specifications. Run any cycle that already processed in production that had DVD produced.
Thanks,
Tun

<strong>Hi Rogelio</strong>: Per our discussion yesterday, please create sample CD as David T suggestion (The job files are on my share directory so you just need to copy them to CD director machine and then trigger them).
<strong>Hi Matt:</strong> How do we forward physical samples CD to client, after Rogelio create CD?
Thanks,
Tun
Hi April,
Can you please advise how you would like to receive samples of the update on the CD?

If your team can display that grid via the software and send a screen shot, that should be sufficient. if not, a disk can be sent to me to review. Just let me know what works for your team. </p><br> <p>Side question: Once this is in place, would we be able to request prior statements to be reproduced for one of our customers?<br>
Hi Ceasar,
Please create a comm cd for this. It's only 1 CD - 1 account
Here's David T instructions:
The job files are on my share directory so you just need to copy them to CD director machine and then trigger them.
\\dell-2100\share\David Trang you will see the lastes .isc and .lbl files they are the image and label file that you normally select when you create a job on cd director

ffinms2_20210325140350_lb.lbl
Thanks,
Rogelio
Hey Cesar,
Can you display that grid via the software and send a screen shot, as client request to Matt in comment #48?
Thanks,
Tun
Matt,
I created the shipping label for this commercial cd.
Please check if this is correct?
Attached UPS label.
Thanks,
Rogelio
If you would like to send a disk to me, the shipping address should be:</p><br></p><p>First Financial Bank</p><p>ATTN: April Murphy</p><p>PO Box 2122 <p>Terre Haute IN 47802

Thanks,<br>Rogelio
Look like CD director does not have access to parallel environment for burning.
I sent a separate email to Peter for the path and Prem to help mount it to CD Director machine before we can burn them.
Thanks
David
Peter,
Any update?
Per DT - I sent a separate email to Peter for the path and Prem to help mount it to CD Director machine before we can burn them.
Thanks,<br>Rogelio
