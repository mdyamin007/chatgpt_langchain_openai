Scripts Review
There is a server with ip address 10.5.20.38 which is known as DSI server or Jump server. In this server we edit and test our scripts. There are other three servers which are development, parallel and production. We can run our scripts directly in the jump server but there are many libraries missing in the jump server. To run our scripts with all the required libraries we have to run our scripts on rht/rhs2/rhs. We cant directly access those servers. To run our scripts on those servers we use the following command.
ssh rht "sh -x /t/test_username.sh" 2>&1|tee /t/username/log/test.log
Lets briefly understand the command,
Here,
ssh = secure shell,
rht = development server, server in which we want to run our scripts
sh = the interpreter
-x = this command shows every execution in the terminal
/t/test_username.sh = this is the script we want to run
2>&1 = here 2 represents error and &1 represents converting the error to an output
| = use for pipeline. Left side is used as input and right side is used for output
tee = this commands show output both in the file and terminal
t/username/log/test.log = this is the log file where the log will be stored.
