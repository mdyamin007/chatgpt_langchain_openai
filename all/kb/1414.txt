Sometimes we are required to leave the back side of first page blank or print something special on it. This is called backer. We usually do this by maintain a variable to count page numbers and a conditional logic to check if it is the back of first page or not. After finding the back, we print the information if we have to, we manually call the next logical page, which starts the printing from the next page.
Generally Backer Section is Called from Logical Page 1 under FormatGroup Definition . When any doc format is called from FormatGroup this time Footer Section will not call, so page count and TTL_PAGES or other write record information need to define with backer section.
