Normally for new tax set up, we asked the below questions. Reference https://app.na3.teamsupport.com/?TicketNumber=34399 comment 4.
1. Data file naming convention - you can ask Jessica or Phoebe for documentation
2. Find out how many tax forms.
3. You can ask customer for 2021 tax data file if customer wants to see last year tax form format. (You can ask DP to process 2021 tax files)
4. For 2022 tax form sample. Custom will need to wait until December-2022
5. Ask customer will this include print, etax, and archival.
a. for etax, we need to find out from customer, is account # x-reference and account type are require. (Here you can get help from Jessica or Phoebe)
b. for archival, you need to find out what is the requirement. For example: individual PDF with an index file. If index file is require, what is the index format. For individual PDF, what it prefer naming convention.
6. Have customer send us test data file/files
