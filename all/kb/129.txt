In order run a script, the script file and related resources like .dfa, .prj, .pseg etc. had to be kept into predefined
folder. This is done by shell script.
Below is the procedure on how to check in resources on RHT(Development) server.
For example we are considering "ronyD" as the user.
Put your resources (those you want to check in) into /d/is/development/ronyD. (e.g. if I want to check in
test_script_rony.sh )
Login as (ssh command to same server)
Username testmain Password DSItestmain$
Write this command -ssh -t rht "/home/master/dsi_dev_checkin.pl <username>"
Use option 1 to submit /check-in
Press enter and you are done. If everything goes well you will be given an development id for this check-in by
which you can access existing development . Resources will be put into correct directory automatically.
The development ID provided here is necessary for future update.
