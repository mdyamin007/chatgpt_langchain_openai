Hi DSi Team,
Just a random courtesy GENERAL reminder. When setting up programs that use ZIP files, please ensure the processing program validates that all file naming conventions inside the zip file is expected. If there are any file naming convention is not recognizable, program needs to email alert and/or exit out to alert DP on what files were unrecognizable.
In addition, the program needs to run MD5 checksum on the individual data inside the zip to ensure no duplicate data files were processed. The exception to the rule Check Image files that have individual tiff images inside zip.
Also, please ask BA team if there is any mandatory data file expected inside a zip file as part of the business rule. (e.g. maybe the business rule requires a cross-reference file, or there is a mandatory statement/notice data file that is always inside the zip).
Thanks!
