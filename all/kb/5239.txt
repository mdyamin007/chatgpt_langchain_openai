we have to add prefix in paperless.list file so that paper get suppressed for the accounts mentioned in paperless file which we add as an entry of ESUP_BY_ACCT field value. This is also called e-Statement/e-notice suppression. This is done automatically from scripting level. Script sets the mail code 'e' for these accounts and these accounts go to e.sup file.
location of paperless file :
development =>  /home/dsi/keep/paperless/paperless.list
parallel      => /home/test/keep/paperless/paperless.list
If you forget to add your project prefix in paperless file or prefix is missing in paperless file but there is ESUP_BY_ACCT entry in insert file then you will get an error like below
So to solve this issue just add the prefix in paperless file. If you run your preprocessing script in development then add prefix in /home/dsi/keep/paperless/paperless.list . Otherwise if you run your script in parallel then add the prefix in /home/test/keep/paperless/paperless.list like below
N.B => paperless file of parallel server is replaced by production server's paperless file after some time. So you may need to add your project prefix couple of time at the time of running preprocessing script . Generally it happens if your project is new which hasn't gone to live ever.
