Step - 01
Open Papyrus Designer then Go to File -> New Project orpress cntrl +n . Then you will see something like below
Step - 02
Here you will have to provide several inputs in the mentioned input fields. Lets discuss about them.
Document Project Name : C:\ISIS\docdef\PRACMS1.prj (give your prj file name with .prj extension and the path where to save this prj)
DocEXEC Profile Name : C:\ISIS\userisis\Ppde.prf (this is same for all project)
Doc. Def. File Name : PRACMS1 (project name = CID + JID)
Line Data File Name : C:\ISIS\data\pracms1.DAT (mention your data file name with path here)
Output File Name : C:\ISIS\afpds\pracms1.afp (specify the afp name here)
Environment : PROCDATE = '08122021' , JOB_SEL = 's'
providing environment variable is optional at the time of creating new project. But we can set PROCDATE , JOB_SEL etc variables here
to use in our project which will be discussed later.
In C:\ISIS\userisis\Ppde.prf file we can tell papyrus where is the default location of data file in INPUT value and where the generate afp will be stored we can also mention it here in OUTPUT value, DFA, IMP file path. Project Name consists of CID and JID. CID stands for Cliend ID or Client name. For example MFCU, BKPL,SSCU etc. Generally CID is made of 4 letters. JID denotes application type. For example MS for Monthly Statement, DL for Daily etc and usually JID is make of 3 digits. So here PRAC is our CID and MS1 is our JID. If we go to Tools -> Generate and click on this option then pracms1.afp will be generated in C:\ISIS\afpds\ this location. Later this afp is converted into pdf.
After filling up input fields press ok then you will see a window like below
There will be 5 DOCFORMATS by default and they are. $_BEFOREFIRSTDOC,$_BEFOREDOC,$_AFTERDOC,$_AFTERLASTDOC,THEMAIN
Step - 03
There are 4 types of window that we can work with. Those are symbolized below
01 -> Data Window  
02 -> Docformat Window 
 03 -> View Document Winodw  
04 -> Format Group Window 
We can open them from window option as shown in the snapshot. if you want to open all those windows and give them same space then click the icon just below window button like below
Though flow of execution of all these docformats will be discussed in a post later , lets see the flow of 5 docformats in a flow chart quickly
Step - 04
Firstly BEFOREFIRSTDOC is executed then BEFOREDOC is executed.
BEFOREDOC is executed before every document but BEFOREFIRSTDOC is executes just once at the beginning of all document.
After BEFOREDOC then THEMAIN docformat is executed and after the execution of this AFTERDOC is executed.
AFTERDOC is executed after every document but AFTERLASTDOC is executed after all documents.
In our real projects we dont use these 5 docformats only rather we divide our works into several docformats which improves the readability of our DFA and help us to maintain project nicely. Those things will be discussed in detailed later. We should keep in mind that if we create any docformat excluding these 5 docformats then Papyrus wont call them rather we will have to invoke them manually from any of these docformats. But these 5 docformats are called by papyrus according to the flow of above snapshot.
