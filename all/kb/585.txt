Don't check any box of Resource Group option , because it will embed the logos and other external resources with the afp file hence the afp size will be huge.
Also don't check the Concatenate box it will concatenate the all individual afps( not sure)
ACIF index generation is needed to generate index file. Otherwise you might get below like error:
 ERROR: PDF found doesn't match index record counts !!!
 PDF count: 4
 Index file count: 0
Max record length should be big enough otherwise you may get output record exceed error( something like that)
