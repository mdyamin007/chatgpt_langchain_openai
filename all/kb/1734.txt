You have new mail in /var/spool/mail/oper1
To fix this, we need to delete existing entries of that dt_job_id.
This can be achived by a script named cleanup_pdf_archival_process.py, currently located in `/home/anwarH/cleanup_pdf_archival_process`
Bellow is the help of that script:
Shows or deletes entries from 'PDF_ARCHIVAL_PROCESS' table is IS Parallel database!
Usage: cleanup_pdf_archival_process.py <command> <params>
command:
show : Shows result of the queries based on provided params
delete : Deletes entries based on params provided.
Params:
cid : Query is based on CID
2. dt_job_id : Query is based on DT_JOB_ID
Example:
python cleanup_pdf_archival_process.py show dt_job_id=128226-C03.01-V22024
To Run this script, you should run this before:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/home/anwarH/cleanup_pdf_archival_process/
