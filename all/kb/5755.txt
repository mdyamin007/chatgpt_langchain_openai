If an old index format is present, it needs to be processed through the AFP process. A new format of the index file with headers is processed through the DOC format. Different parsing classes have been written for each format to parse line data since old files are in different formats. A single generic parsing class exists for the new R format. Parsing old files with a new parser will result in a missing data type error on the line.
