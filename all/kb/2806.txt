A sample coupon looks like below-
The coupon area covers the 1/3rd portion of the whole page.
After a perforation line the coupon area starts. Sometimes customer wants to print the line, sometimes not.
Some customer wants the coupon to print at the top of the page and some wants at the bottom of the page.
The coupon is torn apart at the customer end. And customer sends that coupon with a different envelop to bank by filling up some fields. So it is important to print the address or logo in coupon area because those things may need to be shown through the envelop window.
If the coupon is at the bottom of the page, it is important to check the 2D bar code and stock code in the print step.
If Micr line or OCR line is required, then it need to be checked for coupon at bottom.
If the other side of coupon page has a backer or any info, it need to be checked.
