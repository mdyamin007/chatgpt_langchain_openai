As we have seen so far, to run our dfa there are over hundreds of scripts that are run in the server. These scripts have to be run on a daily basis as the clients data are coming regularly on a certain time. So there are hundreds of scripts that have to be run on a daily basis which is a tiresome job. Here comes the cron which can be scheduled for each script to run on a specific time. We can set the command for each script in the cron and the script will be run automatically at the specified time.
minute hour day_of_month month weekday command

#15 05 * * 2-6 . /home/control/daily.control; /home/master/plbkdna_process.sh 1 0 2>&1 > /d/daily/plbkdna/today.log

The bottom one is to set to run testmode parallel.

Explanation how to set the time for cron:
for starln by Peter per skype:
#3004 * 2-6 . /home/control/daily.control; /home/master/starln_process.sh 1 0 2>&1 > /d/star/starln.log
and the data file arrival time is Mon-Fri, 4am PST:
so the cron is set to search for data in 30 minutes after 4am . And also need to include dailly.control to set the environment variable . while calling the script need to provide 0 in bypass argument.
Here are some examples set by Tun:
Daily Notices M - Sunday @ 6:30am PST
30 06   1-7 export dp_printer="tx_dp"; . /home/control/daily.control; /home/master/ufcudla_process.sh 1 0 2>> /d/daily/ufcu/today.log
Mortgage M - F @ 6:30am PST
30 06   1,2,3,4,5 export dp_printer="tx_dp"; . /home/control/daily.control; /home/master/ufcuml1_process.sh 1 0 n,s,e 2>> /d/ufcu/ufcuml1_today.log
Escrow EOM from 28th - 2nd @ 6:30am PST
30 06 28,30,31,1,2   export dp_printer="tx_dp"; . /home/control/daily.control; /home/master/ufcuea1_process.sh 1 0 n,s,e 2>> /d/ufcu/ufcuea1_today.log
Monthly Daily Ad Hoc M - F @ 6:30am PST
30 06   1,2,3,4,5 export dp_printer="tx_dp"; . /home/control/daily.control; /home/master/ufcums1_process.sh 1 0 n,s,e 2>> /d/ufcu/ufcums1_today.log
We can not set the schedule on our own. Offshore team sends us the scheduling and we send the command to the offshore manager and the manager sets the command in the cron.
