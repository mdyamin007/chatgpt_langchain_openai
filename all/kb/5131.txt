When we run for estatement/enotice each customer will get their statement/notice through their email.
From our side in dfa we generate individual afp ( single afp for each customer ) and index file in certain fixed format when run for 'f' option.
And from script side we provide those afps (in zip) and index file to isd/estatement team who are responsible for to provide estatement/enotice sample to customer.
Bank/CU can also archive those estatement sample for certain period, so that if for some particular customer a sample needs to be provide again bank/cu can do that from archived samples.
Below video is a discussion of how to implement code for estatement in dfa.
