For the afp_split_count, PDF files are generally 3 to 4 times larger than AFP. So we should use a smaller number. If our standard is 10,000 files per zip, then I would use 25% of 10,000 which would equate to 2500 per zip.
[Standard rule of thumb for afp_split_count quantity. We just want to make sure the zip file size on the average is not bigger than 1GB. Please share this general rule of thumb when working on individual AFP or PDF. If the file is too big, the eStatement system may not be able to handle copying and unzip the file via their Java programming]
