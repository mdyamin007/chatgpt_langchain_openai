This means if any customer pages excess 7( convention) pages then this heavy envelope will be used for it, it is a big envelope where pages are inserted without folding.

Address are put in another location in the colver overlay to view through the window of the heavy envelope.
To pull the cover overlay you need to put the overlay name in control file like this:
