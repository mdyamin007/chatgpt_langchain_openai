Below are some discussion about it between Mizan and Anil:
Mizan,
There are 3 types of statements as per database table storage(ISD database) is concerned. One is E-notices, all e-notice details are stored in enotice table. Second category is taxes and are stored in etax table. Final and last category is statements. All statements other than notices and taxes are stored in estmt_doc table. We have a service called processing-ui which all InfoImage member(DP,QA,ISD etc) would use to insert records on to database. We call process of inserting records as posting of cycle. When we post a cycle, it can be processed via afp processing or document processing. Now NTSB Escrow Analysis statements are stored in estmt_doc table meaning they are regular statement types and not e-taxes or e-notices. Next NTSB Escrow statements are processed via document processing. Document processing can post statements and e-notices. Whenever you see doc posting, you cannot say if it is a statement or e-notice. Your part should be updating code to read content from appropriate table and show data.
Regards,
Anil.
David/Michael,
I had a call with Naim regarding this issue. His team has a blocker of updating code infotrac UI code. When we post a cycle using document processing, database stores type as doc. As per current code, they are querying estmt_doc or enotice or etax table based on type like afp, enotice, etax or doc. Now since doc type processing can post statements and e-notices, they are not sure of which table to search for. In future, document processing can also post taxes, how can they query appropriate table based on type doc.
Regards,
Anil.
Hi Anil,
Please have DSI review the EStmtRegistrarFactory. Based on the application id parsed from the index file and the {cid}.conf we know if the application is enotice or etax.
Thanks,
