[00:00.000 --> 00:07.000]  Charlie can drop, and it will make a change like you can drop.
[00:07.000 --> 00:12.000]  All right, thanks everyone.
[00:12.000 --> 00:15.000]  Thank you. Can you guys see my screen now?
[00:15.000 --> 00:18.000]  Yes, yes.
[00:18.000 --> 00:42.000]  Let me lock in.
[00:42.000 --> 00:51.000]  Yeah, so this dashboard here, basically in monitors, what's going on on the protection floor?
[00:51.000 --> 00:56.000]  So, first thing first, we do have two facilities.
[00:56.000 --> 00:59.000]  We have one in California, we have one in Texas.
[00:59.000 --> 01:02.000]  So, you put your mouse over, this pink one here, it will tell you.
[01:02.000 --> 01:06.000]  F3, four men, or F4, or Texas.
[01:06.000 --> 01:13.000]  You know, they basically, it will, it will segregate, you know, these jobs, depending on the facility.
[01:13.000 --> 01:19.000]  So, passing F3 will give me all the, all the protection jobs that's going on right now.
[01:19.000 --> 01:25.000]  And then you can click on drop date, right over on the upper right hand corner.
[01:25.000 --> 01:31.000]  So, these are the date that, you know, these are the, they were the jobs supposed to be dropped.
[01:31.000 --> 01:36.000]  For example, March 2nd, March 4th, you know, drop names.
[01:36.000 --> 01:42.000]  Oh, meaning that the post, we will drop it off to the post office.
[01:42.000 --> 01:46.000]  Someone come to the facility and pick it up, pick up the mail piece.
[01:46.000 --> 01:50.000]  So, that's drop off.
[01:50.000 --> 01:59.000]  So, yeah, so basically this, the whole purpose of this dashboard is to monitor what's going on on the floor.
[01:59.000 --> 02:06.000]  So, say, you know, when, when DP process a job, so you can see right here, it's DP.
[02:06.000 --> 02:07.000]  Okay.
[02:07.000 --> 02:09.000]  So, when they process a job.
[02:09.000 --> 02:15.000]  So, while they process, if they have not turned over to the next department, it stays yellow.
[02:15.000 --> 02:18.000]  That mean, when it's yellow, it's still sitting in DP.
[02:18.000 --> 02:19.000]  Okay.
[02:19.000 --> 02:20.000]  It's still sitting in DP's court.
[02:20.000 --> 02:25.000]  Once it goes green, that mean they're going to turn it over to laser.
[02:25.000 --> 02:28.000]  So, if it's in yellow, that mean laser still have it.
[02:28.000 --> 02:29.000]  Okay.
[02:29.000 --> 02:33.000]  Now, Tim, Tim, the person who's working on this pin job.
[02:33.000 --> 02:42.000]  And because we, because since we just moved to our new facility and we acquire a new printer equipment,
[02:42.000 --> 02:49.000]  now the printer is a continuous fee and the server is called the PEXMA server.
[02:49.000 --> 02:54.000]  And then I'm working on a project to try to pull the status for these pin jobs.
[02:54.000 --> 02:58.000]  Actually, I kind of got the, you know, I have the code written.
[02:58.000 --> 03:00.000]  It's just that on the user side.
[03:00.000 --> 03:05.000]  They have, you know, it's the way they use the server to print this job.
[03:05.000 --> 03:08.000]  They are not recording the correct information.
[03:08.000 --> 03:12.000]  So, I'm still working with them on that.
[03:12.000 --> 03:19.000]  You know, once they're able to, as soon as they're doing correctly,
[03:19.000 --> 03:26.000]  I'm able to pull the, for each of the print files, save 4.21, 5.20 Z,
[03:26.000 --> 03:32.000]  and I will actually display here and then display the time.
[03:32.000 --> 03:36.000]  Actually, I could do a demo, but I don't think it's necessary, you know?
[03:36.000 --> 03:41.000]  Because I do have the code to pull the, you know, pull in any print file from the PEXMA server right now.
[03:41.000 --> 03:44.000]  But anyway, I don't want to, yeah, let's not spend time on that.
[03:44.000 --> 03:50.000]  And then once laser is going to spot in a mailing, that's the insert document, you know, like here.
[03:50.000 --> 03:55.000]  Like all these file here, you know, these are the file that the start time and time,
[03:55.000 --> 03:58.000]  and these are the file that hasn't been working on yet.
[03:58.000 --> 04:00.000]  Now, everyone is on red.
[04:00.000 --> 04:05.000]  Okay, it's not clean.
[04:05.000 --> 04:08.000]  If it's completed, that mean it goes green.
[04:08.000 --> 04:13.000]  Again, you know, these are the two file, you know, in the start time and the end time.
[04:13.000 --> 04:17.000]  And the person who handling was then, you know,
[04:17.000 --> 04:21.000]  they start an end time means here.
[04:21.000 --> 04:23.000]  Of course, Pacific time.
[04:23.000 --> 04:24.000]  U.S. time.
[04:24.000 --> 04:26.000]  Okay.
[04:26.000 --> 04:31.000]  Oh, I'm sorry, maybe I didn't get the question correctly.
[04:31.000 --> 04:33.000]  Can you answer that?
[04:33.000 --> 04:35.000]  You know, what is the Easter time here?
[04:35.000 --> 04:37.000]  I mean, Easter time for fun.
[04:37.000 --> 04:41.000]  Oh, the start time is they start because when they say after they print it, right?
[04:41.000 --> 04:44.000]  So they are in a flat sheet of paper, right?
[04:44.000 --> 04:47.000]  So they need to insert it into an envelope.
[04:47.000 --> 04:49.000]  So we have an insert a machine.
[04:49.000 --> 04:53.000]  So it's for the insert machine, for each of the job, they actually create a profile.
[04:53.000 --> 04:54.000]  Okay.
[04:54.000 --> 04:59.000]  In the profile, I have the character stick of the paper stock and the envelope stock.
[04:59.000 --> 05:00.000]  Okay.
[05:00.000 --> 05:04.000]  I don't know much detail anymore, but I just can tell you.
[05:04.000 --> 05:06.000]  They set up a profile in the profile,
[05:06.000 --> 05:11.000]  I think the character stick of this job, you know, such a paper, you know,
[05:11.000 --> 05:14.000]  paper stop envelope stock.
[05:14.000 --> 05:19.000]  If they have insert, you know, like return envelope, consider insert a promotional insert.
[05:19.000 --> 05:21.000]  It's an insert, you know, have all those configurations.
[05:21.000 --> 05:28.000]  So doing the insert time, not only it will put the document, it will put the insert if necessary.
[05:28.000 --> 05:29.000]  Okay.
[05:29.000 --> 05:29.000]  Okay.
[05:29.000 --> 05:31.000]  And then the OMR code is very important too.
[05:31.000 --> 05:33.000]  The OMR code tells you how many pages to put.
[05:33.000 --> 05:38.000]  That's why one of the bar is end of document.
[05:38.000 --> 05:39.000]  Right.
[05:39.000 --> 05:41.000]  End of document telling a, you know what?
[05:41.000 --> 05:46.000]  Of course, there's three, there's four bar that tells you how many image to pull.
[05:46.000 --> 05:52.000]  And then the last one would have the end of document bar turn on.
[05:52.000 --> 05:55.000]  So one thing with that bar is okay, you know what?
[05:55.000 --> 05:58.000]  I'm going to pull, just say for example, I'm going to pull two sheets of paper.
[05:58.000 --> 06:01.000]  The second sheet, you know, has the bar, you know, end of document.
[06:01.000 --> 06:04.000]  So it's okay, I'm going to pull two sheets and stuff it into the envelope.
[06:04.000 --> 06:06.000]  I mean, that's mailing, right?
[06:06.000 --> 06:14.000]  And then in, in, in California, we do have, we do have a pre-sorter, you know, right here.
[06:14.000 --> 06:16.000]  Here's a pre-sorter same thing, you know, right here.
[06:16.000 --> 06:18.000]  It's a four dot two one file.
[06:18.000 --> 06:20.000]  It's in the pre-sorting department right now.
[06:20.000 --> 06:21.000]  Okay.
[06:21.000 --> 06:23.000]  But in Texas, because Texas is outsource.
[06:23.000 --> 06:26.000]  So we don't have a pre-sorting Texas.
[06:26.000 --> 06:31.000]  So if you, if I switch over to, to Texas, which is F4, right?
[06:31.000 --> 06:33.000]  So I hit the key F4.
[06:33.000 --> 06:35.000]  It was graded, shaded.
[06:35.000 --> 06:39.000]  That means these are Texas jobs in Texas.
[06:39.000 --> 06:43.000]  All the pre-sort is, you can see it's, it's got block off, right?
[06:43.000 --> 06:46.000]  Because there's no pre-sorting.
[06:46.000 --> 06:50.000]  All right, let's go back to California.
[06:50.000 --> 06:55.000]  And then one of the things that people use is to get the TPVS.
[06:55.000 --> 07:00.000]  If you could get to this board, you could, you could click on the plot ID.
[07:00.000 --> 07:01.000]  Okay.
[07:01.000 --> 07:07.000]  It would dynamically generate the TPVS.
[07:07.000 --> 07:08.000]  All right.
[07:08.000 --> 07:09.000]  So which is very helpful.
[07:09.000 --> 07:13.000]  You know, if there is production job, you need to do any research.
[07:13.000 --> 07:16.000]  You know, first you can locate the, the job.
[07:16.000 --> 07:18.000]  And then you could pull up the TPVS.
[07:18.000 --> 07:24.000]  And then in this case, let me.
[07:24.000 --> 07:29.000]  Oh, because, because it is, we convert the block ID to a barcode,
[07:29.000 --> 07:34.000]  post and con, you know, because now, oh, actually the block ID is right here.
[07:34.000 --> 07:41.000]  Two, three, zero, zero, five, three, one, two, three, zero,
[07:41.000 --> 07:49.000]  two, three, zero, zero, five, three, one.
[07:49.000 --> 07:54.000]  And then mixed with it's a DT job ID. Okay.
[07:54.000 --> 07:55.000]  You click on the DT job ID.
[07:55.000 --> 07:59.000]  It would tell you the instruction, how to handle this pin jobs.
[07:59.000 --> 08:02.000]  It's all here.
[08:02.000 --> 08:03.000]  Okay.
[08:03.000 --> 08:05.000]  You know, what trade do you use?
[08:05.000 --> 08:10.000]  You know, this job has process, process, print, mail, archival.
[08:10.000 --> 08:12.000]  In this case, no Eastamen mailing.
[08:12.000 --> 08:18.000]  You know, it's the insert or not right here.
[08:18.000 --> 08:23.000]  And I don't even machine setting.
[08:23.000 --> 08:27.000]  Oh, this is how they set up the machine, which I don't understand.
[08:27.000 --> 08:30.000]  You know, basically they adjust the paper, you know, up and down.
[08:30.000 --> 08:32.000]  And then mail piece.
[08:32.000 --> 08:36.000]  In this case, just envelope, you know, number 10.
[08:36.000 --> 08:39.000]  If it's heavy, stock code is this blah, blah, blah, blah.
[08:39.000 --> 08:43.000]  Mail handling, we do have, you know, special instruction if there's any
[08:43.000 --> 08:48.000]  information for preset file to mail in.
[08:48.000 --> 08:53.000]  Anyway, you can click on any of it, you know, and then it will give you the instruction.
[08:53.000 --> 09:02.000]  And then, and then the thing that, let's talk about the things you're interested in.
[09:02.000 --> 09:05.000]  Basically right here, this little icon here, job type.
[09:05.000 --> 09:09.000]  So right here, this is where you enter, you know, when you set up a new job,
[09:09.000 --> 09:36.000]  so if you need to edit any of it, you know, you can type over, you know,
[09:36.000 --> 09:39.720]  leave it let me add something yeah it would delete it let me see let me see I
[09:39.720 --> 09:43.080]  could add something just fake
[09:49.480 --> 09:59.840]  put it job type oh there's a job type is j id say why
[09:59.840 --> 10:08.240]  uh since it doesn't have ml just say ml one then
[10:08.240 --> 10:10.640]  uh
[10:11.440 --> 10:14.720]  season co nine version nine nine nine nine nine
[10:14.720 --> 10:27.120]  description this is a test active if you know and then say and then yeah you
[10:27.120 --> 10:36.240]  could now and then look for right here right and then now you're
[10:36.240 --> 10:42.560]  delete delete scon okay yeah so this is the one you're interested
[10:42.560 --> 10:48.000]  um that's simple enough and then right here there's another one uh i am
[10:48.000 --> 10:53.200]  b here you know sometimes you say hey what's the i am b for a particular cid
[10:53.200 --> 11:00.960]  you know basically you could type in the cid it tells you what's the
[11:00.960 --> 11:05.440]  male ID right here and then the male type the male type
[11:05.440 --> 11:08.880]  you know so these are the two piece of information that you might have
[11:08.880 --> 11:13.120]  interest the male ID and then the male type
[11:13.120 --> 11:17.040]  you know other than yeah other than defining in the control valve
[11:17.040 --> 11:20.320]  you know we actually have this information in the database
[11:20.320 --> 11:23.280]  yeah
[11:23.280 --> 11:28.320]  hey bt sorry there is uh how do you determine the
[11:28.320 --> 11:31.920]  version number in a number like oh the version
[11:31.920 --> 11:37.200]  yeah yeah let me let me show you because the dashboard
[11:37.200 --> 11:42.960]  actually tie into uh several database so actually i think you can get that
[11:42.960 --> 11:46.800]  information uh from report you could go to
[11:46.800 --> 11:53.840]  um customer let's see does it have it uh customer profile
[11:53.840 --> 11:58.480]  and then for example we say big good boyer
[11:59.920 --> 12:04.960]  and then let's see i could pull that information
[12:05.280 --> 12:11.760]  here's the let me in basically custom under customer profile you know contact
[12:11.760 --> 12:15.440]  you know customer contact information email blah blah blah and then you go to
[12:15.440 --> 12:19.520]  application tab just click on it it will give you all the application
[12:19.520 --> 12:22.400]  and then here's the cid here's the app code here's the version ID
[12:22.400 --> 12:26.880]  so when when there's a new job for the very first department who set up the
[12:26.880 --> 12:30.640]  job is production control okay these information came from production
[12:30.640 --> 12:34.720]  control so if you say a what was my app number and here was my
[12:34.720 --> 12:39.680]  version number here it is basically you could come here and you could
[12:39.680 --> 12:43.360]  compare their database to our database you know it's the same or not
[12:43.360 --> 12:47.600]  and here it has a status it is job active or not active
[12:47.600 --> 12:53.280]  you know basically on us on us the table do we
[12:53.280 --> 13:04.080]  we put in we put in active and not active do we disclose i forgot
[13:06.160 --> 13:09.760]  over here we do disclose is it active or not active
[13:09.760 --> 13:16.080]  yeah so so if you didn't want to know you know where to get it first it's in the
[13:16.080 --> 13:21.040]  SLW you know second you could pull it out from here
[13:22.240 --> 13:28.960]  yeah um but procedurally procedurally you need to come from SLW
[13:28.960 --> 13:32.240]  because on the those are supplied by the other department
[13:32.240 --> 13:36.960]  easy tomorrow to get to i have so so just to make sure
[13:36.960 --> 13:40.880]  don't you can choose focus on SLW to get the
[13:40.880 --> 13:46.160]  version ID and and i have ID as the procedure
[13:48.400 --> 13:53.360]  yeah and then um
[13:54.160 --> 13:57.120]  there's another report here these are the production
[13:57.120 --> 14:00.240]  target you know basically i don't think you guys will
[14:00.240 --> 14:10.000]  be cared but um oh i need to pick a Texas job one
[14:10.000 --> 14:13.920]  because what happened is if it's a Texas job these uh paperwork actually
[14:13.920 --> 14:20.880]  get copy over to Texas let me pick one
[14:23.680 --> 14:27.440]  so please drop you know see this uh dt job ID
[14:27.440 --> 14:33.680]  you know um here's a dp we asked
[14:33.680 --> 14:36.560]  let's see it shows up
[14:38.240 --> 14:42.720]  yeah that shows up so if you know why now it's this for this particular job
[14:42.720 --> 14:44.880]  seems like it's missing the runtime work order
[14:44.880 --> 14:49.600]  if it has a runtime work order this this this document will actually
[14:49.600 --> 14:55.840]  get move over to Texas or say copy over to Texas
[14:55.840 --> 15:01.520]  okay that's how uh Texas facility get our paperwork
[15:03.680 --> 15:08.480]  and then and then um you know when you do um you know say a particular job is on
[15:08.480 --> 15:13.200]  whole you could click here you know job on whole anything on red is still on
[15:13.200 --> 15:18.720]  whole it is blue you know that means someone released it
[15:20.240 --> 15:24.800]  all right and then right here on this column it is red that means on whole
[15:24.800 --> 15:28.880]  all right and they you know it's supposed to put in a reason why it's on
[15:28.880 --> 15:31.760]  whole but a lot of time it's a job on whole you know we don't know what's the
[15:31.760 --> 15:37.440]  reason you know and then it's released i said it's blue you know job approved
[15:37.440 --> 15:42.960]  by customer and maybe you could say something like job on whole waiting or
[15:42.960 --> 15:45.920]  if it's a waiting for customer approval waiting for approval
[15:45.920 --> 15:54.800]  anyway so if it is like what does it mean it's full it's some good
[15:55.600 --> 15:59.600]  on whole for various reason right here it didn't explain in this case if you
[15:59.600 --> 16:05.040]  look at this here there are the uh the release message was customer
[16:05.040 --> 16:07.760]  approved so you can say the job was on whole because we're
[16:07.760 --> 16:12.160]  waiting for customer to approve oh right the whole can be for where is
[16:12.160 --> 16:19.440]  the reason we made our paper stock usually it made there's an error you
[16:19.440 --> 16:23.520]  know data issue you know under research you know waiting for
[16:23.520 --> 16:27.680]  AS to get to which out to customer waiting for customer respond
[16:27.680 --> 16:33.200]  you know also the reason basically it just it just free flow message
[16:33.200 --> 16:40.080]  anything can be put on here so on that job is put on whole we will not process
[16:40.080 --> 16:44.080]  any kind of they are there all right um no when it's on whole
[16:44.080 --> 16:48.160]  I mean usually it will mostly happen in in the key
[16:48.160 --> 16:52.720]  doing processing you know because there's some uncertainty
[16:52.720 --> 16:58.080]  so they will put the job on whole okay so but once it moved to laser it could
[16:58.080 --> 17:01.440]  be on whole too but i could tell you once it moved to laser when it's on
[17:01.440 --> 17:05.120]  whole because we run out of something you know usually laser what happened
[17:05.120 --> 17:09.280]  run out of paper stock but these day less and less happened because you know we
[17:09.280 --> 17:12.640]  use less and less preprint because we have to continue sleep printer
[17:12.640 --> 17:17.280]  and we use an e-form you know e-form is a just thing of it is an electronic
[17:17.280 --> 17:21.040]  preprint you know image that we laser onto the the the
[17:21.040 --> 17:26.800]  continuous the white paper continuous uh feet uh white paper so we don't
[17:26.800 --> 17:31.520]  really getting less and less you know I don't know how many job out there we
[17:31.520 --> 17:35.200]  still use preprint today if there's no preprint we will never run our
[17:35.200 --> 17:41.920]  stocks but once you got to inserting like a spot and mailing the job can
[17:41.920 --> 17:45.680]  be put on whole too well once you get there we put on whole I could pretty
[17:45.680 --> 17:49.120]  much can guess they want our insert
[17:49.120 --> 17:54.000]  right just say insert is a requirement and because we we ran our physical
[17:54.000 --> 17:58.480]  insert so the job can be put on whole but like that very very seldom
[17:58.480 --> 18:05.760]  usually when it's on whole it's only doing processing okay
[18:05.760 --> 18:10.400]  and then I'll research to narrow down because it's too much business for today
[18:10.400 --> 18:14.800]  you know so if I for today you know like I said I had F3 it will give me
[18:14.800 --> 18:19.680]  all the other job for men love for today but then I want to do
[18:19.680 --> 18:22.960]  with some research I want to focus in then you click on the research
[18:22.960 --> 18:32.000]  you can put in any CID then you put in a day wrench you can just put in today
[18:33.760 --> 18:38.720]  and then there's different type of date you know process day job day
[18:38.720 --> 18:42.400]  and then oh there's facility too
[18:42.400 --> 18:46.720]  usually I don't really because usually I don't really
[18:46.720 --> 18:55.360]  yeah if you you know if you put in all then it makes sense to pick the
[18:55.360 --> 19:00.960]  facility you know but if you but you didn't know of a particular CID then
[19:00.960 --> 19:05.520]  there's no point
[19:05.520 --> 19:08.800]  oh in this case there's none
[19:08.800 --> 19:13.440]  I mean you let's put a day wrench say the first
[19:13.440 --> 19:18.000]  to the fourth let's see where any yeah there's there's a couple
[19:18.000 --> 19:23.680]  yeah so that way you could narrow down a you know what these uh these uh
[19:23.680 --> 19:31.520]  uh this is the job this is the CID where I want to do some research
[19:31.520 --> 19:36.240]  okay and then um
[19:36.240 --> 19:46.160]  and then another thing you might be interested is the CID reporting
[19:46.160 --> 19:49.680]  you know because this is a control break report
[19:49.680 --> 19:54.560]  so we usually uh accounting use it a lot
[19:54.560 --> 20:04.560]  stay I picked an entire February
[20:06.640 --> 20:13.200]  basically it will give you also like pick a boy or then we have three jobs with
[20:13.200 --> 20:16.960]  us they the letter DDA statement and then Rexy
[20:16.960 --> 20:22.240]  Lionel credit and then here's the daily volume here's a sub total
[20:22.240 --> 20:25.840]  here's the volume for the statement and then here's the sub total
[20:25.840 --> 20:30.720]  and then here's the volume for the LC here's a grand total for that month
[20:30.720 --> 20:34.880]  so that's the volume you know this E-table can do volume for
[20:34.880 --> 20:40.080]  whole year even going back to two three years if you can do
[20:41.200 --> 20:46.480]  but it's under a different capital I haven't used this for quite a while my
[20:46.480 --> 20:53.760]  those for me port I'm in January those people for a while um
[20:53.760 --> 20:58.080]  another thing you might be interested the um let's see
[20:58.080 --> 21:08.320]  management report um for example let's pick a FCSB with FSP or FMPP
[21:08.320 --> 21:14.640]  let's see just say between here and here and then
[21:14.640 --> 21:23.200]  you go I want all the I want all of them uh job that is cycle monthly weekly daily
[21:24.480 --> 21:29.200]  and then oh there's no job under it's not FCSB
[21:29.200 --> 21:33.920]  Fort Hood didn't remember first national Fort Hood
[21:33.920 --> 21:44.800]  and D that's what they try yeah Fort Hood and before Fort Hood National Bank so
[21:44.800 --> 21:50.000]  what happened they don't really have this monthly job 44
[21:50.000 --> 21:54.480]  and what happened on production control
[21:54.480 --> 21:59.520]  these three that let it be supposed to be daily but then instead of using a
[21:59.520 --> 22:06.160]  D they they use m instead because they say oh this is a statement job
[22:06.160 --> 22:10.080]  so I kind of talk to them I say you know what you're not using those information
[22:10.080 --> 22:18.720]  correctly they put something like m m 3 or m 4 yeah I forgot I forgot
[22:18.720 --> 22:22.640]  but anyway and then you can click on it it will give you
[22:22.640 --> 22:29.280]  all the other jobs you know it and the same thing here you know you click on
[22:29.280 --> 22:36.400]  here it will give you the DPVS and then you click here give you the
[22:36.400 --> 22:41.760]  you know instruction to handle the job you could print it you're like
[22:41.760 --> 22:51.360]  and then basically if you look here
[22:51.360 --> 22:54.960]  everything was dropped on time there's nothing late or nothing early it's just
[22:54.960 --> 23:00.720]  on time you're to minimize this just click on it
[23:01.680 --> 23:07.840]  and then another one you might be interested is the camera system
[23:07.840 --> 23:10.800]  you can search by account number you know number if you don't know the
[23:10.800 --> 23:14.240]  number you can put in the name let's see
[23:14.240 --> 23:22.560]  let's put in michael j let's see michael j fox put in a big range as
[23:22.560 --> 23:27.520]  anything comes back
[23:28.560 --> 23:32.000]  michael j anything
[23:37.200 --> 23:41.360]  oh something comes back yeah of course you could narrow it down you know because
[23:41.360 --> 23:45.760]  you could continue to type for example
[23:45.760 --> 23:50.400]  those are different methods okay yeah so you could filter it
[23:50.400 --> 23:53.920]  in yeah different michael j is not michael j fox
[23:53.920 --> 24:01.120]  michael j michael j but the whole idea is because when the male
[24:01.120 --> 24:04.480]  piece leave our facility we actually scanned the
[24:04.480 --> 24:09.120]  scanned the the address block so we actually
[24:09.120 --> 24:13.920]  captured it to the that's how we validate you know that
[24:13.920 --> 24:18.080]  this this
[24:18.080 --> 24:20.640]  when you go ahead
[24:21.200 --> 24:24.480]  please come on have the name please ID this
[24:24.480 --> 24:28.640]  this oh when you call it mind block let me put the dv this
[24:28.640 --> 24:32.000]  when you call that the 2d bar the 2d bar the 2d prefix
[24:32.000 --> 24:36.400]  see this 2d prefix 4r u 4a is a file ID right
[24:36.400 --> 24:42.000]  so you could tell this is the 4d 4d 2d 1 file
[24:42.000 --> 24:47.280]  right 4a is 4d 2d 1 yeah yeah and then here's the account number
[24:47.280 --> 24:50.880]  you know yeah of course you could search you could type in the account number
[24:50.880 --> 24:59.200]  and then put in the stay range about it will come up as well let's try
[24:59.200 --> 25:12.160]  you know sometime when when when doing formatting
[25:12.160 --> 25:16.240]  you know how the if it's a print image the address block can strip up and
[25:16.240 --> 25:18.880]  down sometime it doesn't really catch it the name sometimes it
[25:18.880 --> 25:23.040]  catches the address sometime when I try to look for image I can
[25:23.040 --> 25:26.880]  I can locate it with account number or name actually I type in the address it
[25:26.880 --> 25:34.000]  will come up to you know oh no what you didn't come did I type in the wrong
[25:34.000 --> 25:58.720]  or something wrong
[25:58.720 --> 26:11.600]  let's get zero and fun okay I don't know why doesn't come up unless the
[26:11.600 --> 26:15.760]  account number has bleeding zero in front of it if you have leading zero you do
[26:15.760 --> 26:18.800]  have to type in the leading zero but when I display I
[26:18.800 --> 26:24.080]  truncate a leading zero I have to I have to do a little research to see why
[26:24.080 --> 26:30.720]  it doesn't come
[26:30.720 --> 26:46.960]  try different
[26:46.960 --> 26:50.640]  give me a second if you are more on me I'm in a meeting with a call you
[26:50.640 --> 27:09.920]  yeah like so it just comes up okay I guess that particular number has a
[27:09.920 --> 27:22.880]  leading zero yeah I put in a different number it does comes up
[27:22.880 --> 27:26.160]  there's other stuff that you know we could talk about but I don't think it's
[27:26.160 --> 27:30.160]  necessary
[27:30.160 --> 27:34.800]  hey there yeah I'll go ahead for what kind of scenario you have to like
[27:34.800 --> 27:41.200]  certainly specific at the number oh and oh when a customer when customer
[27:41.200 --> 27:45.600]  call for support you know their customers member can report in and say
[27:45.600 --> 27:52.160]  hey you know what I never got my mail then we have to prove it you know
[27:52.160 --> 27:56.640]  because just think you say you have a market
[27:56.640 --> 28:01.040]  long and you call in and say hey you know what how can you charge me a
[28:01.040 --> 28:05.120]  late charge I never got a I never got a notice how can you
[28:05.120 --> 28:08.800]  charging me a fee and late charge and interest so they would try to
[28:08.800 --> 28:14.400]  dispute and then in this bill they took the new the the bang on the credit
[28:14.400 --> 28:18.160]  union we go to info image info image do you got to deliver the mail
[28:18.160 --> 28:22.560]  how are we going to prove it so we need to prove it unfortunately we only
[28:22.560 --> 28:26.240]  keep it for three months because the
[28:26.240 --> 28:33.760]  how do you prove it but yeah no by sewing the the camera image okay
[28:33.760 --> 28:38.240]  that we actually mailed it and then because once you track down the mail
[28:38.240 --> 28:42.560]  the the 2D the 2D you located the print you located the
[28:42.560 --> 28:46.320]  prefix you located the perfect you can locate the the print file
[28:46.320 --> 28:49.600]  because you can locate the part ID you can locate a DD job ID you could get
[28:49.600 --> 28:52.480]  to the print file and you could actually look for the print file and give
[28:52.480 --> 28:56.400]  them an image not only you could give him a scan image of the address block
[28:56.400 --> 28:59.760]  that proved that actually left our facility you also can give them the
[28:59.760 --> 29:03.280]  actual statement image if we still have it because we have extended
[29:03.280 --> 29:06.960]  tracking because turning on extended tracking is by default
[29:06.960 --> 29:11.520]  so basically we keep it in these share ISD folder right it's still there
[29:11.520 --> 29:15.840]  you know if extended tracking is is is is turn on
[29:15.840 --> 29:19.840]  all right okay so we could base on base on these kind of research
[29:19.840 --> 29:24.560]  we we just reverse engineer to get back to the print file
[29:24.560 --> 29:27.200]  once you get to the print file we can get to the image and give it
[29:27.200 --> 29:32.240]  but only if they ask for the the document because what happened is
[29:32.240 --> 29:35.840]  the criterion say or the balance say hey can you actually give me a PDF so I
[29:35.840 --> 29:38.800]  could mail it to the customer so we can give him a PDF
[29:38.800 --> 29:43.600]  and then up to them how to deliver it
[29:43.600 --> 29:47.760]  but we're not usually we don't mail out for you know for these kind of
[29:47.760 --> 29:51.680]  research yeah recently we just give them a PDF yeah you give it to your
[29:51.680 --> 29:58.880]  member yeah okay so infamous mail everything to the
[29:58.880 --> 30:03.440]  USPS right the post office right
[30:03.440 --> 30:09.040]  uh yeah post office I we actually get there's a truck mail truck come and
[30:09.040 --> 30:12.720]  pick up the mail piece and then deliver to the post office
[30:12.720 --> 30:19.760]  okay um what is the proof here that delivered to the post office
[30:19.760 --> 30:23.760]  the camera name is uh there's a thing called mail tracking
[30:23.760 --> 30:27.840]  you know a mail tracking remember we have a feature called mail tracking
[30:27.840 --> 30:32.640]  in the control file mail tracking is turned on then which means the post
[30:32.640 --> 30:36.480]  office is sent us a week back of report but those information is not in
[30:36.480 --> 30:40.000]  this system though that information is in the info track
[30:40.000 --> 30:44.960]  it's handled by ISD okay if I'm not mistaken you know whatever information
[30:44.960 --> 30:49.520]  coming back from the post office actually they ISD the one who's storing those
[30:49.520 --> 30:53.520]  information I think they actually provide a
[30:53.520 --> 30:57.360]  interface for our member to retrieve them I I will I would think
[30:57.360 --> 31:03.360]  make sure it's on the info track system um so I look at job status
[31:03.360 --> 31:10.560]  um and there's an envelope icon um and a globe icon and a truck icon
[31:10.560 --> 31:14.880]  um that's the data stored on the MongoDB so like parents described our
[31:14.880 --> 31:19.840]  laser processing uh tick-free files that we put in the ISD share
[31:19.840 --> 31:24.960]  and they in turn ingest it into the Mongo database um
[31:24.960 --> 31:31.680]  and then post office on a daily basis FTPs all
[31:31.680 --> 31:36.400]  of the informages um mail that we sent out
[31:36.400 --> 31:40.160]  uh so that we promise that proper data and update the Mongo database
[31:40.160 --> 31:44.000]  on a daily basis so that it tracks the activity
[31:44.000 --> 31:47.280]  of all where the mail is moving
[31:47.280 --> 31:51.280]  from post office to post office
[31:53.680 --> 31:56.720]  yeah this that's what here is for internal use
[31:56.720 --> 31:59.680]  just to monitor what's going on in the floor
[31:59.680 --> 32:04.880]  production floor yeah so I don't know how any customer says
[32:04.880 --> 32:08.960]  that I did not receive my email mail
[32:08.960 --> 32:13.760]  um and you check the camera image right
[32:13.760 --> 32:18.880]  for that you the image mail is actually left from the information
[32:18.880 --> 32:23.120]  my name is japan image oh yeah the camera image just keeps track
[32:23.120 --> 32:27.360]  uh just is evident for image produced the mail piece
[32:27.360 --> 32:34.480]  right okay uh once uh uh it leaves uh once it gets dropped
[32:34.480 --> 32:38.560]  mail tracking is to track the performance
[32:38.560 --> 32:41.760]  of where that mail piece is leaving the post office
[32:41.760 --> 32:44.560]  on it's outside info response later after
[32:44.560 --> 32:48.640]  so when the customer reports in the same mail piece
[32:48.640 --> 32:52.400]  um parents described we look at the camera to say that did info which
[32:52.400 --> 32:55.680]  actually print it it shows proof that we printed it
[32:55.680 --> 32:58.560]  you want in prom and did it leave our shop
[32:58.560 --> 33:02.240]  they have the truck that we leave their shop but if they have mail tracking
[33:02.240 --> 33:06.480]  that's an additional evidence we'll say hey since you have mail tracking services
[33:06.480 --> 33:12.080]  we can help uh USPS prove that uh um that is
[33:12.080 --> 33:16.240]  uh USPS is actually mailing it and they lost it okay
[33:16.240 --> 33:20.880]  um so anything after the drop date um
[33:20.880 --> 33:27.360]  it's outside info image responsibility
[33:27.360 --> 33:31.680]  and then um here oh password if you want to change your password just click on
[33:31.680 --> 33:35.600]  it you can change your password you know and then you want to lock in
[33:35.600 --> 33:38.400]  again just go lock in you don't even need to lock up just go lock in
[33:38.400 --> 33:41.200]  it will not automatically lock you up and then here
[33:41.200 --> 33:45.680]  these things here it's not in our concern for example if i want to
[33:45.680 --> 33:49.840]  check in a particular job for laser okay because i'm not in that department
[33:49.840 --> 33:55.520]  i'm not allowed to do so all right so any of these we cannot use
[33:55.520 --> 33:59.200]  you know it's check out spot you cannot because we're not
[33:59.200 --> 34:04.240]  we're not in that department so don't worry about those
[34:06.080 --> 34:12.160]  it's a main reason two thing you will eat for IS is this here you know
[34:12.160 --> 34:18.640]  and then if you want to know the um the IMB information then you come here
[34:18.640 --> 34:22.080]  these are the take we use of course for research you know we do use this
[34:22.080 --> 34:29.040]  dashboard yeah yeah i don't have anything else you know to
[34:29.040 --> 34:34.000]  to disclose further okay or to discuss further
[34:34.000 --> 34:40.000]  okay one side question turns out what is
[34:40.000 --> 34:47.760]  the mail type like aac3 oh oh
[34:47.760 --> 34:51.360]  uh yeah before yeah right
[34:51.600 --> 34:55.440]  but yeah if if if if there's mail tracking in the
[34:55.440 --> 35:01.760]  control file it has to be aac3 but aac1 aac2 i don't really know what they
[35:01.760 --> 35:05.680]  you basically obviously they have no mail tracking uh between one and two i
[35:05.680 --> 35:17.040]  don't know what it means i mean it's the same but aac3
[35:21.920 --> 35:24.800]  right you probably you you've got said there are many time you know is i
[35:24.800 --> 35:36.400]  right yeah without knowing that so if if if mail mail tracking you
[35:36.400 --> 35:42.160]  know is weak is uh it's a it's customer a sign of feature
[35:42.160 --> 35:46.400]  then when you configure the control file
[35:46.400 --> 35:50.400]  and you have to say mail full service equal to aac3
[35:50.400 --> 35:57.360]  that's wrong but yeah and tracking is on
[35:58.800 --> 36:07.040]  normally we put here aac3 or aac4 but and
[36:07.600 --> 36:14.880]  we don't get this information from sw we just reference other project
[36:14.880 --> 36:20.800]  that's a this is sfc new app then we just take the old app
[36:20.800 --> 36:26.960]  and see they are the aac3 is different so we use aac3 in the new app
[36:26.960 --> 36:32.000]  that's it well it's not defined in the sw
[36:32.000 --> 36:35.600]  yeah you might want to bring of course
[36:35.600 --> 36:41.920]  doing the project turnover uh my me review the sw the sw along with the
[36:41.920 --> 36:46.000]  PA uh and the implementation person that's the time when you raise the
[36:46.000 --> 36:50.640]  question you know if it's not defined because i could tell you
[36:50.640 --> 36:55.360]  they know that them aac3 is full oh yeah because they know
[36:55.360 --> 36:59.280]  yeah but then i could tell you some of the um i am people i mean i am
[36:59.280 --> 37:04.320]  the implementation person they will they will sometimes say
[37:04.320 --> 37:08.080]  after we went live with the job then they will raise a question like
[37:08.080 --> 37:13.840]  oh how about a mail tracking you know often you hear that kind of question
[37:13.840 --> 37:18.800]  that after the job ran live then they say oh how about mail tracking well
[37:18.800 --> 37:22.800]  and you never ask for it well it's supposed to be there
[37:22.800 --> 37:27.040]  you know that's the argument back and forth right i think you get those
[37:27.040 --> 37:30.880]  questions before i get those questions and how come how come we don't
[37:30.880 --> 37:34.960]  get mail tracking well you never said it you need it
[37:34.960 --> 37:39.120]  but of course if you if you just gonna uh mirror other application
[37:39.120 --> 37:42.480]  i would not say don't merit because what happened is
[37:42.480 --> 37:46.400]  you just you know and i i get into it he did
[37:46.400 --> 37:51.440]  conversation many many years ago you know when when when an
[37:51.440 --> 37:54.800]  implementation person say oh set up this job
[37:54.800 --> 37:59.040]  look like a particular job difference the idea but they say hey you know
[37:59.040 --> 38:02.800]  set up this job look like that one then i said what why do i need you if
[38:02.800 --> 38:06.160]  that's the case you know if you just tell me to mirror this job off
[38:06.160 --> 38:10.640]  the other job then what do you guys do you know you you tell me you are
[38:10.640 --> 38:16.080]  you are you cannot even clone a copy of that saw and then go in and make changes
[38:16.080 --> 38:20.400]  to the saw and revise it you you tell me you cannot even do that
[38:20.400 --> 38:23.200]  then why do i need you right so i get into it he did hit the
[38:23.200 --> 38:26.880]  conversation i said you when you turn on one a job i don't care
[38:26.880 --> 38:31.360]  you clone a particular saw do whatever you need
[38:31.360 --> 38:35.200]  but that you need to give me saw dummy and the information in that saw
[38:35.200 --> 38:39.520]  has to be accurate right i don't tell me to follow a particular
[38:39.520 --> 38:43.120]  obligation no i'm not here to look at other obligation
[38:43.120 --> 38:47.280]  just think it's there's a daisy chain you know a a follow cc follow
[38:47.280 --> 38:51.760]  bp follow t and then sunny one of them change all the other one sunny
[38:51.760 --> 38:56.880]  you know what it's not the same right basically each one of it is dependent on
[38:56.880 --> 39:06.640]  each other anyway i hope i answered your question
[39:06.640 --> 39:12.720]  anything else so for new application
[39:12.720 --> 39:17.520]  what do we need to do in the tape or just to set up by the
[39:17.520 --> 39:27.120]  personality yeah the time yeah the time when you were ready to release basically the
[39:27.120 --> 39:31.920]  time key way we say hey you guys use for a long
[39:31.920 --> 39:36.480]  male ID that's the time when you can come in and use as yourself
[39:36.480 --> 39:40.880]  a what is the male ID you know and then of course
[39:40.880 --> 39:45.840]  in order to prove the correct male ID it has to be a s e 3 because if you say a
[39:45.840 --> 39:50.480]  s e 1 it will use info image male ID
[39:50.480 --> 39:53.920]  right so that's why when you say hey you know a lot of time i just cloned
[39:53.920 --> 39:58.960]  the other other application and to see hopefully it will work
[39:58.960 --> 40:03.680]  only way it works is this customer they actually apply for the
[40:03.680 --> 40:09.280]  own male ID i could tell you 10 years ago or even 15 years ago
[40:09.280 --> 40:15.040]  our customer they don't apply for the male ID they use info image male ID
[40:15.040 --> 40:20.080]  okay as the business progress or over time we advise customer and you know
[40:20.080 --> 40:23.920]  what you guys apply your own male ID the reason is
[40:23.920 --> 40:29.120]  i think i think i have to deal with return male when i'm being returned in
[40:29.120 --> 40:34.320]  know who you turn it to because the male ID is registered
[40:34.320 --> 40:39.200]  under their own company's name not info image right if you have any type of
[40:39.200 --> 40:43.840]  returns service return a male service it has to be your own male ID
[40:43.840 --> 40:47.760]  you cannot use info image
[40:47.760 --> 40:53.360]  yeah so where we saw them today we use a s e 1
[40:53.360 --> 40:58.400]  because so that's why when you say hey you know what do i use a s e 3
[40:58.400 --> 41:02.640]  first you come here and tighten the cid and you look for
[41:02.640 --> 41:06.000]  does this record exist if your record exists does they have a
[41:06.000 --> 41:10.240]  male ID if it has a male ID you could pretty much say you know what
[41:10.240 --> 41:16.800]  i think i will set up as a s e 3 because it doesn't have a male ID
[41:16.800 --> 41:20.560]  or this record doesn't exist then you might ask a c a a c
[41:20.560 --> 41:25.600]  you know customer never apply for their own male ID
[41:25.600 --> 41:29.200]  you know can you verify you know then they may
[41:29.200 --> 41:32.800]  the implementation my advice customer and you know what do you want to apply
[41:32.800 --> 41:37.200]  your male ID if you doesn't apply in time then we use a s e 1 we will use
[41:37.200 --> 41:43.440]  info image male ID for the meanwhile i mean for uh yeah until
[41:43.440 --> 41:47.040]  you know customer apply the own male ID then we will put the record here
[41:47.040 --> 41:50.000]  but once they put it in here then what do we have to do we have to go to the
[41:50.000 --> 41:55.440]  control file and change it and we have old jobs where where uh
[41:55.440 --> 42:00.240]  ego when we do a word of job day and then suddenly ego is a fail
[42:00.240 --> 42:03.280]  fail for what i just said word of job day well
[42:03.280 --> 42:08.080]  just still using uh info image male ID well but the request
[42:08.080 --> 42:14.160]  was for word of job day not not not uh not uh we turn male service
[42:14.160 --> 42:18.640]  update and beside if you want that you need to talk to
[42:18.640 --> 42:23.760]  a c and have a c talk to customer i don't know it's a cost
[42:23.760 --> 42:27.120]  you know associate to this you know they have to inform customer a customer
[42:27.120 --> 42:30.800]  we're going to change this application to use your male ID right now you know i
[42:30.800 --> 42:34.880]  don't know there will be a cost but we cannot just say a uh
[42:34.880 --> 42:38.880]  two-way fail because there's no male ID which often they do
[42:38.880 --> 42:42.240]  but then i say you know what you you could fail for some other reason but you
[42:42.240 --> 42:44.880]  cannot fail for word but word of job day you could open up a
[42:44.880 --> 42:47.280]  particular and say you know what i noticed that this job
[42:47.280 --> 42:52.320]  are using info image male ID i think it should be changed to their own
[42:52.320 --> 42:55.280]  male ID they used to talk key ways to talk to a c
[42:55.280 --> 42:58.720]  and and and notify them and a c and then talk to customer a you know
[42:58.720 --> 43:02.000]  i'm going to switch your job over to your male ID that may be even
[43:02.000 --> 43:05.920]  charged customer for it but don't fail my job because they say you know what
[43:05.920 --> 43:10.080]  how come you're not using the uh male ID customers may like because these
[43:10.080 --> 43:13.680]  job was set up long time ago
[43:13.680 --> 43:15.920]  so day six basically you know we go into these
[43:15.920 --> 43:21.120]  argument at the time
[43:21.120 --> 43:25.600]  if i wanted i need to drop off that um i had to care this production issue
[43:25.600 --> 43:28.720]  people seem to offer better yeah i don't think it would
[43:28.720 --> 43:31.920]  yeah i don't think it would take it much longer just wrapping up with
[43:31.920 --> 43:37.680]  questions though okay i think so well thanks
[43:38.960 --> 43:43.920]  uh any other questions
[43:43.920 --> 43:53.040]  and any any more question if not then we
[43:53.040 --> 43:56.320]  we gotta go back to sleep
[43:59.200 --> 44:04.320]  no thank you okay then uh you gotta have uh today's Thursday

ETABoard Introduction
[00:00.000 --> 00:02.520]  This one right there.
[00:02.520 --> 00:05.720]  So you have to log in, right?
[00:05.720 --> 00:06.800]  Right.
[00:06.800 --> 00:10.240]  Then when you log in,
[00:10.240 --> 00:14.120]  you see this button right there.
[00:14.120 --> 00:15.680]  Yes.
[00:15.680 --> 00:18.280]  This button, it's just type.
[00:18.280 --> 00:20.520]  Just click on it,
[00:20.520 --> 00:23.480]  and then you have this one.
[00:23.480 --> 00:28.600]  Now, if you want to see existing CID,
[00:28.600 --> 00:33.520]  you just go to this field and low case,
[00:33.520 --> 00:35.520]  no capital, low case.
[00:35.520 --> 00:39.480]  For example, PLBK, for example, right?
[00:39.480 --> 00:40.680]  Right.
[00:40.680 --> 00:44.400]  PLBK. Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
[00:44.400 --> 00:46.840]  sorry. Don't listen to me right now.
[00:46.840 --> 00:47.720]  Okay.
[00:47.720 --> 00:50.520]  Okay. So if you want to see existing,
[00:50.520 --> 00:54.800]  you go here, search for job type.
[00:54.800 --> 00:58.000]  You click here, and you,
[00:58.000 --> 01:00.760]  for example, PLBK.
[01:00.760 --> 01:04.520]  Okay. It says retrieve,
[01:04.680 --> 01:07.360]  and it gives you this one.
[01:07.360 --> 01:13.440]  Okay. Now, if you want to add job type,
[01:13.680 --> 01:16.800]  let's do from the beginning, right?
[01:16.800 --> 01:24.080]  You go in here, and add job type.
[01:24.080 --> 01:30.920]  Okay. So you're just adding PLBK,
[01:30.920 --> 01:33.560]  and then job type, whatever,
[01:33.560 --> 01:38.880]  MS1, MS2, application number, version number, right?
[01:38.880 --> 01:42.960]  Job ID, it's going to be like
[01:42.960 --> 01:47.560]  monthly statement or daily letters.
[01:47.560 --> 01:50.920]  Okay. Then you click save.
[01:50.920 --> 01:54.400]  Okay. I mean, that's all.
[01:54.400 --> 01:56.920]  Then after you got this one,
[01:56.920 --> 02:02.160]  it's going to be here like small confirmation that,
[02:02.160 --> 02:04.040]  yes, this job is added,
[02:04.040 --> 02:10.640]  and then you can go here and see if it's really there.
[02:10.640 --> 02:14.360]  That's all. Nothing else.
[02:14.360 --> 02:21.560]  Okay. For FRS-T, right?
[02:21.560 --> 02:23.960]  For example, retrieve.
[02:23.960 --> 02:26.520]  Here we go. We've got more.
[02:26.520 --> 02:29.200]  There is delete button also.
[02:29.200 --> 02:34.440]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, be careful.
[02:34.440 --> 02:36.480]  Yeah, be careful.
[02:37.120 --> 02:38.520]  Okay.
[02:38.520 --> 02:40.480]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:40.480 --> 02:44.240]  Well, I mean, not the best application,
[02:44.240 --> 02:47.160]  but that's what it is.
[02:47.560 --> 02:49.800]  Another thing, Ronnie,
[02:49.800 --> 02:52.280]  but this is my experience.
[02:52.280 --> 02:56.040]  For some reason, for some reason,
[02:56.040 --> 03:00.560]  so I have same rights like you.
[03:00.560 --> 03:03.880]  I mean, I can add job type.
[03:03.880 --> 03:05.480]  But for some reason,
[03:05.480 --> 03:09.640]  when I'm adding job type right there, okay?
[03:09.640 --> 03:12.440]  For some reason, I cannot see.
[03:12.440 --> 03:18.520]  I mean, I'm receiving confirmation that this job type is added.
[03:18.520 --> 03:21.280]  But however, when I'm trying to search,
[03:21.280 --> 03:23.560]  it's not going to happen for me.
[03:23.560 --> 03:25.560]  I don't know why.
[03:25.560 --> 03:27.720]  So what I'm doing,
[03:27.720 --> 03:32.520]  I'm asking Alice or I asking somebody to check if it is there.
[03:32.520 --> 03:38.040]  But then, like one day after it, yeah, I can see it.
[03:38.040 --> 03:41.160]  It's kind of strange.
[03:41.160 --> 03:44.080]  I mean, I already checked with everybody.
[03:44.080 --> 03:46.480]  I mean, I cleared my cache.
[03:46.480 --> 03:49.760]  I did everything, but it's still like this.
[03:49.760 --> 03:57.800]  Okay. So this one, that's what it is.
[03:57.800 --> 04:01.240]  Also, here, what you can do here,
[04:01.240 --> 04:04.920]  also, do you have this button right there?
[04:04.920 --> 04:07.360]  Yes, I'm de-updating. Yes.
[04:07.360 --> 04:15.920]  You know what it is, right? Not quite.
[04:15.920 --> 04:18.160]  Okay. So I mean, I can show you.
[04:18.160 --> 04:21.480]  So if you click on this button right there.
[04:21.800 --> 04:27.280]  So here, you can check mailer ID.
[04:27.280 --> 04:37.640]  So for example, you FRST, right? Also, low case, right?
[04:37.640 --> 04:43.280]  Bloom, and this one right there.
[04:43.280 --> 04:47.040]  Okay. You know this?
[04:47.040 --> 04:48.320]  Mailer ID.
[04:48.320 --> 04:52.760]  Mailer ID beneath the address.
[04:52.760 --> 04:56.760]  So that's what it is. Boom, right there.
[04:56.760 --> 05:02.080]  So when you do the QA,
[05:02.080 --> 05:05.600]  you come here to see the mailer ID?
[05:05.600 --> 05:08.920]  Yes. Yeah. Well, I mean,
[05:08.920 --> 05:14.680]  this mailer ID should be provided in SOW, right?
[05:14.680 --> 05:17.000]  So sometimes it's provided,
[05:17.000 --> 05:21.000]  sometimes if it's same.
[05:21.000 --> 05:24.640]  So who said those things here?
[05:24.640 --> 05:28.360]  This one, you know Kelvin, Kelvin?
[05:28.360 --> 05:30.840]  Kelvin from whose department?
[05:30.840 --> 05:36.400]  He is from operation. Kelvin, Kelvin Choi.
[05:36.400 --> 05:39.160]  PC, PC, production control?
[05:39.160 --> 05:40.800]  Yeah, production control.
[05:40.800 --> 05:46.280]  I mean, well, this is based on UPS, USPS.
[05:46.280 --> 05:47.440]  USPS, okay.
[05:47.440 --> 05:50.760]  USPS, United States Post Office, right?
[05:50.760 --> 05:54.640]  So based on this, he is setting up the stuff right there.
[05:54.640 --> 05:56.320]  Okay.
[05:56.320 --> 06:00.920]  So basically, I mean, that's all what I have.
[06:00.920 --> 06:04.640]  Okay. So normally here,
[06:04.640 --> 06:10.360]  you do the job type setup, right?
[06:10.360 --> 06:12.120]  Say it again.
[06:13.760 --> 06:16.840]  You create job type right here?
[06:16.840 --> 06:20.800]  I am not creating well.
[06:20.800 --> 06:23.520]  No, normally for new application.
[06:23.520 --> 06:26.920]  For developers have to do it.
[06:26.920 --> 06:28.000]  Oh, okay.
[06:28.000 --> 06:30.080]  I mean, sometimes, I mean,
[06:30.080 --> 06:32.440]  when like, for example,
[06:32.440 --> 06:33.800]  like in your case,
[06:33.800 --> 06:37.080]  you don't have access to this, right?
[06:37.080 --> 06:38.720]  So right now we have.
[06:38.720 --> 06:40.960]  Right. Yeah. So before you didn't, I mean,
[06:40.960 --> 06:44.880]  I did it just to help it.
[06:44.880 --> 06:50.360]  But do you know that why we have to do it?
[06:50.360 --> 06:52.840]  Do you know that? I mean,
[06:52.840 --> 06:58.160]  what is the significant of that track?
[06:58.160 --> 07:01.440]  Job type, this is for my understanding.
[07:01.440 --> 07:03.160]  This is for, I mean, I am not sure.
[07:03.160 --> 07:05.920]  I mean, but this is for the billing.
[07:05.920 --> 07:07.520]  Oh, okay.
[07:07.520 --> 07:10.080]  Okay. So yeah.
[07:10.080 --> 07:13.560]  So like PC, production controls,
[07:13.560 --> 07:19.160]  they, one second.
[07:19.160 --> 07:24.840]  So retrieve.
[07:24.840 --> 07:28.200]  So they're looking for these numbers right there,
[07:28.200 --> 07:31.040]  application number, version number,
[07:31.040 --> 07:34.440]  and that how they, I mean,
[07:34.440 --> 07:36.560]  doing this billing.
[07:36.560 --> 07:46.920]  Okay. Now, also, I think that this actually,
[07:47.920 --> 07:54.320]  well, I don't know who is updating this.
[07:54.320 --> 07:56.200]  Somebody need to update this,
[07:56.200 --> 07:58.120]  but I don't know if they,
[07:58.120 --> 08:00.120]  you see, I mean, right now,
[08:00.120 --> 08:02.600]  is they all active.
[08:02.600 --> 08:08.200]  But I'm sure that some of them is,
[08:08.200 --> 08:10.840]  well, is not, I mean,
[08:10.840 --> 08:12.520]  nobody using them.
[08:12.520 --> 08:15.120]  I mean, right? Like commercial loan,
[08:15.120 --> 08:17.320]  yes, later.
[08:17.320 --> 08:18.960]  And also, I mean,
[08:18.960 --> 08:21.160]  you see, you can see double entry,
[08:21.160 --> 08:22.320]  which is mean.
[08:22.320 --> 08:23.760]  Well, what does it mean?
[08:23.760 --> 08:26.680]  Does it mean it is redesigned already?
[08:26.680 --> 08:29.360]  Right. But it's still there.
[08:29.360 --> 08:33.200]  Okay. Now, for example,
[08:33.200 --> 08:35.080]  no, this one probably bit,
[08:35.080 --> 08:36.560]  not good example,
[08:36.560 --> 08:39.720]  but I saw in a couple of CITs.
[08:39.720 --> 08:40.280]  Understood.
[08:40.280 --> 08:42.680]  Yeah. There is a doubles.
[08:42.680 --> 08:44.320]  There is a doubles.
[08:44.320 --> 08:46.000]  I don't remember which one,
[08:46.000 --> 08:48.960]  but app number, version, right?
[08:48.960 --> 08:49.640]  Yeah.
[08:49.640 --> 08:52.040]  App and version.
[08:52.040 --> 08:53.320]  Well, good.
[08:53.320 --> 08:57.560]  Say it again. What are you looking for?
[08:57.560 --> 09:00.920]  App number and version.
[09:00.920 --> 09:03.640]  It's mentioned in this normally, right?
[09:03.640 --> 09:07.840]  So, this one is application number and version number, right?
[09:07.840 --> 09:08.960]  Let's show it.
[09:08.960 --> 09:13.400]  And a single application can have multiple version?
[09:13.400 --> 09:14.600]  I mean,
[09:14.600 --> 09:17.760]  Single, no, no, no, no, no,
[09:17.760 --> 09:22.200]  my understanding is that each application has,
[09:22.200 --> 09:27.480]  each application has version and application number.
[09:27.480 --> 09:29.320]  And unique?
[09:29.320 --> 09:30.160]  Those are unique?
[09:30.160 --> 09:30.680]  Oh, yes.
[09:30.680 --> 09:32.600]  No, yes, yes, yeah, yeah.
[09:32.600 --> 09:38.360]  I don't know where is this coming from.
[09:38.360 --> 09:39.160]  Okay.
[09:39.160 --> 09:41.160]  I believe maybe it's coming from
[09:41.160 --> 09:45.280]  production control or from operation or from Kelvin.
[09:45.280 --> 09:46.400]  I mean, I don't know.
[09:46.400 --> 09:52.840]  But I'm getting this from SAW.
[09:52.840 --> 09:53.800]  Yeah.
[09:53.800 --> 09:58.080]  And so, if you want to know more about this,
[09:58.080 --> 10:03.200]  you probably need to ask somebody from Phoebe.
[10:03.200 --> 10:04.160]  Okay.
[10:04.160 --> 10:06.240]  Somebody from implementation team.
[10:06.240 --> 10:07.840]  From implementation team.
[10:07.840 --> 10:14.400]  I mean, they're going to tell you more details on this.
[10:14.400 --> 10:15.720]  Okay.
[10:15.720 --> 10:16.880]  Stop.
[10:16.880 --> 10:19.280]  So, basically, is it all?
[10:19.280 --> 10:20.240]  Okay.
[10:20.240 --> 10:24.440]  So, not much, not much.
[10:24.440 --> 10:25.120]  Okay.
[10:25.120 --> 10:25.880]  Not much.
[10:25.880 --> 10:27.320]  Okay.
[10:27.320 --> 10:28.240]  Thanks so much.
[10:28.240 --> 10:28.720]  Okay.
[10:28.720 --> 10:30.000]  No, no, no, no problem, Ronny.
[10:30.000 --> 10:32.080]  Anytime, anytime, anytime.
[10:32.080 --> 10:35.280]  Whatever I know here, let me know.
[10:35.280 --> 10:36.120]  Okay.
[10:36.120 --> 10:37.280]  Okay.
[10:37.280 --> 10:37.880]  Bye.
[10:37.880 --> 10:39.680]  Thank you, Ronny.
[10:39.680 --> 10:50.480]  Bye.
