For pdf archival we write groupindex command in dfa and one of attribute is pdf_file_name which is responsible for renaming the pdf after generating by in afp2pdf call in the processing script
be careful about the value of thispdf_file_name in the dfa , because if it contains any slash(/) inside it's value liket/pdf_afp/wash/washds1/pdf/3/13/02_35431.pdf it will treat /3/13 as folder structure not pdf name ( here the wanted pdf name is 3/13/02_35431.pdf which will cause problem) .
So for the afp2pdf script it will search /3 folder and /13 folder inside it and as those folder not exist ( or even if exist this is not what we want) it will get error or cause unexpected result.
