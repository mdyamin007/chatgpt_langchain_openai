Key Points:
Format group ( logical pages ) is used to control flow of contents to pages and page count calculation, printing header/footer of each page.
If not called from the Document Format Definition window by default 1st format group is used.
If the format group DUPLEX call were not there, still DUPLEX will be used in the FORMATGROUP Definitions window since this is the first formatgroup defined in the FORMATGROUP Definitions window.
Let's say you used format group DUPLEX from Document Format Definitions window which has logical page 1 and logical page 2 and in DUPLEX format group on logical page 2 used format group DUPLEX1 which also has logical page1 and logical page 2 and each page has its own Footer and PrintFooter. The execution flow will be:
This is by assuming the output has in total 4 pages.
To print the page numbering PrintFooter is must.
As you are seeing page no is being printed using CUR_PAGE var which gets incremented in PRINTFOOTER. You cannot display the page numbering in FOOTER because you need to know the total pages in the final output and you can know that after all FOOTER get executed. Since we know PRINTFOOTER gets executed after all FOOTER so at the time of executing PRINTFOOTER we know the total page count .
Footer doesn't get executed while printing backer/disclosure.
As you are seeing in Logicalpage 1 FOOTER we used Logicalpage NEXT which will use Logicalpage2 to print text. And after that in that FOOTER we printed the backer( just text in this example but it could be full page image). In this kind of scenario the footer of Logicalpage2 will not get executed meaning the page calculation in Logicalpage 2 FOOTER will not get executed. We need to do this Logicalpage 2 FOOTER calculation in Logicalpage1 FOOTER where we printed the backer.
