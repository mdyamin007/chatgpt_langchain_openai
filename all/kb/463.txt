Normally Piece code error looks like this:
Sometimes settings all the INSERT to 0 in the insert file & reprocessing it solves the problem.
Generally for every insert there has to be corresponding pieceCode that PC has to enter in the database. Most of the time when process fail with pieceCode error it is due to missing database entry.
piece can be cycle specific . It depends on how PC creates it for a day or for whole month. Meaning in DT_JOB_ID like136752-C11.01-V21365 the peice the PC created should be valid for this cycle 11. Otherwise you don't supposed to see the pieceCodes in log file.
Also in my experience the print dfa should have inline imb ( IMB_INLINE ) implemented to get piece code value in the log.
