To See cvs commit history:
It's always helpful to check the commit history since it tells you the jira no or ts no , dev for each release. To see commit history you need to run /home/master/xfer_rpt.pl in production.
ssh to production server and run:

It will give you different options to check commit history:
As you are seeing it is also giving a version id with the file name. Those are actually backup revision files. In above snapshot for MVCUMS31.dfa the MVCUMS31.dfa.20220419173318 is the previous version of the last release.
This is important, with this naming you can find the previous version file in /home/isis/isisbackup/ folder.
In these listed folders above you can find the previous versions dfa in isis folder, control file in control file, script in master folder and so on.
below is an example how to rollback code using this commit history.
