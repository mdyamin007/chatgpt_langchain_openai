Many banks/cu want the extra messages to display in their customer's statements, maybe for their advertisement of some new feature or can be for something else. Those are not static or hardcoded messages. Those can be changed from time to time and those messages are not provided by the client initially while we developed a project. Those messages come from a infotrac system (called a campaign) and from our dfa we get those messages from some path in the server and display in the statement. Below is an example. The marked text/image is not hardcoded in the dfa like the bank logo or some other fixed logo but gets generated when we run the script from another system.
We can divide the whole task in to 3 steps:
Dfa part. See this post
