DT_JOB_ID (Example): 136752-C11.01-V21365
Some Info:
This Id gets sets up by the PC Team.
There will be one 'dt_job_id' for each cycle.
If you run the process without this id and try to post the E-statement index file, it will fail.
If you want to give ISD index, then we must need dt_job_id, and also the InfoTRAC needs to be turned on.
Needs to be set in the insert file if you want to scan any data file
InfoTRAC:
Without this Id, this will not show up on the InfoTRAC site.
For every dt_job_id, you run the process with, there will be a separate entry in InfoTRAC in the job status module. If the id remains the same, that entry will be overwritten in the subsequent run.
Daily:
For daily process, there are usually ran by a corn job. As the cycle changes for every run, the cycle portion of dt_job_id (e.g. 136752-C11.01-V21365) gets automatically updated by the process to match the proc_date of that cycle/data file date.
Bypass:
When we ran the processing script with bypass parameter, you skip calling the 'update_daily_insert.sh' or 'update_insert.sh'.
Right now, we don't do this anymore. They get to called always.
Important:
When you set dt_job_id for the first time in the 'insert file', You must need to run the 's' option first, before running the 'f' option. Otherwise, this will fail!
A possible reason is can be, the job first gets created when you run the 's' option, after that, that job gets updated when you run the 'f' option.
If you set new dt_job_id, this is mandatory!
Only E-Statement:
If any client only has an e-statement and no paper jobs, you still need to run the s option for the first time, and then run 'f' option.
You also need to set 'mail_code' to 'z' for every statement in order to prevent printing those statements.
This is a must!
