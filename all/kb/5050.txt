Things to know before conversion
Image Formats
JPEGLossy format, Meaning you will lose data in the process. If you convert text pdfs into jpeg, depending on you settings it can be blurry. But this format also saves the most space. TIFFLossless format. Meaning it will store each and individual pixel information without any compromise. Best for printing/disclosure/text related pdfs. Supports transparency. Support multipage image, meaning one image can have multiple page of a pdf. PNGSupports transparency. Smaller file size. Most used in web. Papyrus doesn't support it. 
DPI
Density per inch, basically means how many pixels are in one square inch. Increasing this means you will have higher resolution image which also increases image size/disk usage. Minimum is 300, Maximum 600. But using 600dpi will increase the file size significantly. 
Color Space
You can also specify color specification which also contributes greatly on the image size and quality. There are mainly three different category
RGBFor color images, file size will increaseCMYKSimilar to RGB, but don't use it unless you know what to doGrayscaleFor black & white image but the image can have 255 shades of black color. File size will be smaller then color RGB/CMYK, but without color. MonochromeJust stores 0/1 Black/White color. Only applicable if your image is just text or don't have any gradient/shade of black. Smaller file size. Image may not look the same. As this steps always discards color information. 
File Compression
For any kind of color space, you can use different algorithm for compression, which will produce different file size. 
CCITT G4/G3Will reduce file size most, but only applicable for monochrome color. Lossy compression. LZWLoserless compression, can be used in any color space. Mostly useful for color or grayscale.  ZIPDon't use unless you know what to do. 
Adobe Acrobat
Steps necessary
Open a pdfGo to "Tools"  "Export PDF"  "Image"Select JPEG/TIFF/PNG (For Papyrus you want to use TIFF)Click on the icon next to that optionChange you settings according to your need. Click "Export"
If there is multiple pages in the pdf, Adobe will create multiple image in the location you specifed.
