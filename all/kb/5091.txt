For version controlling of our papyrus resources dfa, logo etc we use pgit(git for printprocess) which makes it simpler to transfer the resources from local to gitlab and vice versa. In below video
there is little discussion how to use it. But first you need to install pgit . For that:
Download and install pgit from here
Download and click to update the pgit to latest version from here

Type pgit and press enter to see all the options available that you can use with pgit
If a project repository say pracms1 is not present in your machine you need to create it first by pgit pracms1 -c
if this is the first time you are running the above command it will ask you to provide some configurations. Below is an example:
Current design we follow 3 branch. User branch, stage, master. Master branch you don't need to worry about. You will be working with mostly stage and your(user) branch.
Assuming currently you don't have any branch in gitlab server for a repository/ project say pracms1 but it has stage branch. You need to pull the stage branch first with pgit pracms1 -pull. All the resources(dfa, data, pseg, tiff etc) will be pulled and distributed to respective folder in your local machine.
Then work on the resources locally. Now to upload your changes to gitlab server to your own branch use pgit pracms1 -s . This will show you which resource will be uploaded and ask you to check the difference first. It's a good habit to check the different first.
You can continue to update in your local machine and use pgit pracms1 -s command to upload the changes to your branch.
Now if you want to merge your change to stage ( to provide to qa, or other dev ) use pgit pracms1 -m . This will merge your branch to stage branch and remove your branch.
