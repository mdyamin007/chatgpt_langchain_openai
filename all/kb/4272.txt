NOCA Processing Setup
What is NCOALink?
The NCOALink Product is a secure database provided by the USPS. It consists of approximately 160 million permanent change-of-address (COS) records of the names and addresses of individuals, families and businesses who have filed a change-of-address with the USPS. The database is updated weekly. Our process compares and updates customer address list against the NCOALink database. 
What are the USPS compliance requirement ?
The implementation of Move Update, the USPS initiative to reduce wasted Undeliverable As Addressed mailpieces and lower costs for the mailing industry as a whole, continues to move ahead with the USPS announcement of a new 70 percent minimum tolerance level for compliance. The USPS has indicated that effective January 4, 2010, it will begin assessing compliance with the Move Update requirements set on November 23, 2008. Mailers will receive penalties if their mailings fail the MERLIN test.
How InfoIMAGE handles the Move Update requirement:
To ensure that our mailing does not fail the 70% tolerance requirement, InfoIMAGE has implemented our safety net. As jobs are processed, all the addresses are compared against the NCOALink database. All the mail pieces that match and have coa beyond the past 90 days, and are not in any return or suppressed files will be moved to the regular 1st class files. They will be mailed out with full postage.
