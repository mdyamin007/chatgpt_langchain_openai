In the below discussion between Rahat and Tun you will find out the processing script for tax , data file , archival script etc.
Processing script - tax_process.sh
Archival script - tax_afp2pdf.pl
Example of Data file - ACBK_TAX_011117_1708_PROD.zip.pgp
 ACBK_CIF_index_file_for_tax_statements.csv.pgp
Rahat - I could not understand how to include the suppression logic insideacbk_tax_irs_address_replace.plbecause this script only changes address. I can check the verbiages needed for suppression how should I make a report out of it?
Tun- Inacbk_tax_irs_address_replace.pl, add mail_code 'z' in IRS data file column 818( likehttp://103.4.147.142:6060/knowledgebase/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/bkfn.1098gen_2017.rar
), if the address block have one of the keywords in JEF. Tax DFAs already handle to pull mail_code from column 818.
Rahat - - Is there any reference project for the suppression report?
Tun - We don't have exactly same request. But BKFN is using similar mail_code logic. (Reference: Search for 817 in /d/master/prep/bkfn/bkfn_reformat_1098.pl.
Rahat - I need the data file to test the archival.
Tun - I copied last year data files in /d/infoftps3/Vend_DSI/client_pickup/print_process/tax/2017/ackk_JEF31026_tax_archival_and_suppress_update/
(ACBK_TAX_011117_1708_PROD.zip.pgp,  ACBK_CIF_index_file_for_tax_statements.csv.pgp). Please use those for testing. We still need to get ready for 2017 data files and 2017 projects files later.
Rahat - And also what is the name of the dfa for acbk tax. We need to add group index in dfa for archival, right?
Tun - Most likely, you don't need to add group index in DFAs. Thoae are standard tax DFAs. All possible tax group index are already in there. ( like
)* DO NOT ADD customized grooup index for specific CID if possible *. Please let me know if you need to add one. (FYI: You can see all standard 2016 DFAs in /home/isis/docdef/*GEN_16.dfa. We have another JEF to create 2017 DFAs.)
Rahat - Also, is acbk tax has separate processing script? if so, what is the name of it?
Tun - This is a standard tax process by tax_process.sh. For archival setup, you need to updatetax_afp2pdf.pl(Reference: similar to other xml index file setup.)
