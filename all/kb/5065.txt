Errors are looked like below
Those errors are seen if FDF, FON, PSG, OVL, CMR options are checked in FormatGroup Application-output-format like below
To solve this issue just uncheck those boxes and check only Profile
IF FDF, FON, PSG, OVL, CMR options are checked then papyrus tries to embed those resources with the afp and we face such errors as a result.
But if you have to embed resources with afp without facing this error then you should increase Max.record length
