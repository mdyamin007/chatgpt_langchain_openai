Sometimes afp generated from your dfa may be the unexpectedly big size. There can be multiple reason:
If you use an image with inline option. In that case, the image will be embedded in the afp which makes the size bigger. Inline means if I give you my afp and you don't have the images used in the afp you will still see the images when you open the afp because with inline option the images gets part of the afp.
If the profile option is unchecked. If selected each time you try to open the afp, it will pull the resources from the location mentioned in the profile file ( possibly C:\ISIS\userisis\Ppde.prf in our case), like it will pull pseg used in this afp from isis/pseg/ folder. But if not selected it will embed the resources in the afp.
When using tiff directly in dfa with INVOKEDLL command if TIFF_IMPORT function is selected instead of IOBDEFS.
