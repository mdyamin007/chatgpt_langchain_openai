Key points:
Combination of Record command, variable subcommand read the data, normally we read one entire line at a time.
Read one customer data in one document.
We read and display one customer data in one document. So when confirmed we reached the end of current customer data or enters the next customer data stop reading.
Skip next customer lines properly while reading current customer so that when reading of next customer starts it will read from the beginning of that customer
Skip the amount of next customer data that we read while reading current customer data so that when we will read the next customer data later it will read from the beginning of the next customer data.
remove unnecessary characters from each line
Per experience, we normallly remove these 3 characters for all projects, other wise it might cause issues while data reading and displaying.
Admissible length exceeds error
if record length exceeds this length this error occurs. Change the length to something big enough that is greater than a line length. 
convert customer data file to windows (CR LF) format in script level
Otherwise it will cause issues while reading data
