Adding Return Mail Service for any Bank step by step :
step - 01 : set mail_full_serv value to ESR1 in your control file and export this variable like below.
As we know, barcode, stock codes, endorsement lines are printed from print_dfa. That's why we need to grab the print_dfa name from the control file and update the code of print_dfa accordingly so that it can print ELECTRONIC SERVICE REQUESTED basis on the value of MAIL_SERV_TYPE
step -02 : Open the print dfa and add the following lines in BEFOREFIRSTDOC
ENDORSEMENT_BY_MAILTYPE =  '' ;
&MAIL_SERV_TYPE = ENVIRONMENT('MAIL_SERV_TYPE') ;
&ENDORSEMENT_TYPE = ENVIRONMENT('ENDORSEMENT_TYPE') ;
USE
  FORMAT IGNORE_IMB_FILE_EXTENSION EXTERNAL ;
Here, we are initializing ENDORSEMENT_BY_MAILTYPE variable and catching MAIL_SERV_TYPE , ENDORSEMENT_TYPE variables value from Environment variables.
Look, we are calling an external dfa IGNORE_IMG_FILE_EXTENSION . Actually this dfa determines the value of &BYPASS_IMB_BAR variables value like below,
step - 03 : Look into the format groups and search for barobj where barcode is being printed. Just after the barcode line add the following line highlighted in the snapshot below,
IF &MAIL_SERV_TYPE=='522' ;
THEN ;
 ENDORSEMENT_BY_MAILTYPE = 'ELECTRONIC SERVICE REQUESTED' ;
Now, ENDORSEMENT_BY_MAILTYPE value is determined.
step - 04 : Update the logic like below in such way that If ENDORSEMENT_BY_MAILTYPE is not empty then print ELECTRONIC SERVICE REQUESTED otherwise print the endorsement verbiage basis on the value of &ENDORSEMENT_TYPE
IF ENDORSEMENT_BY_MAILTYPE== '' ;
THEN ;
 IF &ENDORSEMENT_TYPE=='R' ;
 THEN ;
  TEXT
   POSITION (INCH(&HOR_POS)+0.9)  (INCH(&VER_POS)-0.85) 
   FONT AR080
   'RETURN SERVICE REQUESTED' ;
 ENDIF ;
 IF &ENDORSEMENT_TYPE=='A' ;
 THEN ;
  TEXT
   POSITION (INCH(&HOR_POS)+0.9)  (INCH(&VER_POS)-0.85) 
   FONT AR080
   'ADDRESS SERVICE REQUESTED' ;
 ENDIF ;
 IF &ENDORSEMENT_TYPE=='T' ;
 THEN ;
  TEXT
   POSITION (INCH(&HOR_POS)+0.9)  (INCH(&VER_POS)-0.85) 
   FONT AR080
   'TEMP-RETURN SERVICE REQUESTED' ;
 ENDIF ;
ELSE ;
 TEXT
  POSITION (INCH(&HOR_POS)+0.9)  (INCH(&VER_POS)-0.85) 
  FONT AR080
  (ENDORSEMENT_BY_MAILTYPE) ;
ENDIF ;
That's it. Now if you check in your control file and print dfa and run the processing script then you will see that endorsement line is coming properly.
Now let's take a deeper look
processing script calls isisdisk and isisdisk source control files
That's why, all the variables of control files are available into current terminal or environment. After that, isisdisk calls
get_mail_seq.pl script and this script makes query into database and writes output of the query into ${working_dir}/${cid}${jid}${segment}${cycle}.mail_full_servb file. If you open the file then you will find something like below,
That means, we need to tell AC/IM person to set mailer id in development and parallel at the time starting development and production at the time of code release. Otherwise script will throw an error.
Look, after calling get_mail_seq.pl script we are catching 2nd column value from ${working_dir}/${cid}${jid}${segment}${cycle}.mail_full_servb file and assigning this value into mail_full_serv_db . Later value of mail_full_serv_db is assigned into mail_serv_type .
After that, at the time of calling papyrus this mail_serv_type value is passed as an environment variable from where print dfa catches it and works basis on it.
