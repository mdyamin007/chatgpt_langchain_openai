2. Click on the "Job Type" icon
3. Click "Search Job Types", this will give you the list of all the job types that are already available, and will also give you an idea of what to add.
4. Click on "Add Job Type"
5. Enter the "CID", "Type" (aka JID), "App Num", "Version", and "Job ID" (aka Name of the job)
6. Click "Save"
