Set estmt_type='HTML' in the control file of the project.
In the e-statement index file the column "PRESENTMENTTYPE" determine the format of e-notice. The default value is pdf. To set it to html add estmt_type='HTML' in the control file.
For more details:
Here is the mail when the print dfa and isisdisk_daily.sh needed update for this requirement

In order to pass the presentment type to PRINT DFA, we will have to pass the variable in by parameter.
Follow below steps:
In control file, add a estmt_type=HTML.
In isisdisk_daily.sh add pass in this variable when calling print_step ().
echo -e "'\$ESTMT_TYPE=$estmt_type' \\">>$pdelsh
*Note: There are many places to add this statement in print step. ADD this statement to the first 3 newDlStructure conditions and the last ELSE condition.
Currently the presentment type is initialized in the ESTMT_IDX_INIT_FIRST.dfa.
In PRINT DFA, add code to capture ESTMT_TYPE as ENV variable .
In ESTMT_IDX_INIT_FIRST.dfa, Below $PRESENTMENTTYPE=PDF, add IF ESTMT_TYPE <>; THEN; &PRESENTMENTTYPE=ESTMT_TYPE
Yamee: For the Statement print step we may need to do the same.
