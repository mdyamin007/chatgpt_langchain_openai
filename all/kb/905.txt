Inserts are return envelopes/notices/ad campaigns etc, that the client wants to add to the statements. They are uploaded by PC using a piece code number to the database. The scripts get the piece codes from the database to add to the txt record or estmt index files. The actual inserts will be pulled when the statements are being inserted into envelopes or posted online.
Inserts are like ad campaigns/notices. So sometimes, the bank can say they want the campaign for specific dates (ex. Jan 1 Jan 15, or Jan 1-Jan 31 or EOM files only). So PC has to enter the piece code for that insert in the database so the script can insert it into the txt or index file so that it can be added for those specific dates when we post or mail.
