If applicable, ask for a paperless sample file/format.
We assume there will a paperless file if we find esup or paperless requirements in the SOW.
The processing script will automatically set 'mail_code' to 'e' for the accounts found in the paperless file in the writerecord.
This is called paperless suppression. Meaning those accounts only wants to have an electronic statement, not the printed one.
Sample paperless file:
When you set 'mail_code' to 'e'those accounts get diverted to the 'e.sup' file.
Setting mail_code to e will cause those accounts to get counted separately to see how many accounts are having e-statement without paper statement.
