When project is turned over to onshore QA, below tasks needs to be done:
There should be no git issues at this point
All dev checklist should be checked
keep updated project in QA folder ( e.g. /d/iss/qa/WECU/).( Be careful here when you exported with 's' option it will not be exported with any logo that is used for 'f'/'e' option. So, b. sure to provide all the resources.)
If your project doesn't include good data file , or if it has bar delimited data file but orginal file was xml and server working directory has those data please ask Qa to refer data from there
provide parallel ID
change redmine/jira status to QA Request (for redmine, first you need to change to in progress then you can change it to qa request)
Provide dpvs (.print file). You can advantage here if you already had a good small data file . You don't need to search for range. You can ask to print full file of different extension(4.2o1, 5.hvy etc)
print range (with afp file name extension , e.g. from 4.2o1 print page 100-105), try to provide customer will multiple pages, provide hvy also if applicable to test the cover page
provide approved sample (Ask IM to do it for you)
parallel estatement index file should be ready (just mention the name of index file to qa example: ms1_20200731_3_20200904_9998_wecu.txt )
archival sample should be ready (mention the directory to qa where archival sample will be found , e.g. /z/pdf_afp/wecu/wecums1/zip/)
provide/forward all types of emails generated from script
if new project should enter version id , app id in datatrac ( http://ca-etaboard-pr-01.infoimageinc.com/prod/login.php )
make sure procs files are ready(references: necums3.procs, wecums1.procs,hfcudla.procs)
checklist ( onshore qa will always ask for this after there testing, so better to complete it as early as possible ) qa_check_list_v1132022
