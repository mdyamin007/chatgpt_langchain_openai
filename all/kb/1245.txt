Your PC:
Open git bash and run the command  ssh-keygen -t ed25519
Press enter multiple time 
Your key will be generated to ~/.ssh
id_ed25519 is the private key, id_ed25519.pub is the public key
Your Server:
You Server need to have this .pub file
go to .ssh folder
copy content of id_ed25519.pub(From your pc) to authorized_keys
 At first , upload your public key in server                                                                          scp id_ed25519.pub <username>@10.5.20.38:/home/<username>/.ssh/<any_name.pub>                          example : scp id_ed25519.pub rumanB@10.5.20.38:/home/rumanB/.ssh/uploaded_key.pub
Then add your key to authorized keys                                                                            cat <key_name.pub> >> authorized_keys                                                                    example :cat uploaded_key.pub >> authorized_keys
You can also use the command below instead of the above 2 commands.
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub <username>@<remote server ip address>
example :ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub rumanB@10.5.20.38
Create theauthorized_keysfile if it doesn't exist!
You can add multiple keys, just add one after another.
That's it, now you can ssh to your server. Peace!!!
