Main Purpose
Our Main purpose is to generate PDF which includes different type of bank statements and sending those statements to our client (InfoImage Onshore team) by mail or archive . After that, they send those statements to the banks. We also generate AFP files which are kept into server, so that user can see their statement later and in that case the files are converted into PDF.
Data Files
Banks give us data file which is used at the time of generating statements.Different data files are used for different projects.Below are some type of data files that we use -
OSI-DNA
Symitar
Print-Image
In general, we often work with these data files.But sometimes,we get some exceptional files like Xml and Hfs files.We make necessary documentation for each of them. Our BA analyze the data files, matches the information with the given mapping and creates a new mock if needed. This mapping contains logic to extract necessary data Which is then sent to a developer to develop the format and script.
A Sample data file - LN6280XP-S104427T-655020-0001
A Sample Mock -LN6280XP-LN6281XP mapping
Papyrus Scripting
Papyrus is a scripting tool which is used to generate AFP (can also generate PDF) files. The source file of the script is a DFA file which reads the data file line by line and then print with necessary format.
Here is a sample of DFA file - WASHML11.DFA
Server-Side Scripting
The DFA created with the Papyrus Designer has to run in the server with the necessary resources (logos, fonts etc.) by papyrus service. This job is designed with a shell script. This shell script is then placed in a corn which waits for Bank to send the real data file. In the process it calls several other parent script. The script do following steps-
Wait for data file
If found generate AFP files for appropriate job type.
Process The APF file/files.
Mail the bank when the process finishes.
A Sample Script- exbkcl1_process.sh
