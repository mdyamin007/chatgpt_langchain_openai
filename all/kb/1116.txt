Also known as CIF file. It's structure can be varied from client to client.
An example of auth file structure:

01 501254556 P CK 8080323026 C 06042016 N A N/A

01 502233210 P CK 8080323097 A N A test7@ICLOUD.COM
Here 6th field is app type and 7th field is account number ( again this can be varied from client to client ).
This app type and account number should be matched our estatement index file. Account number is 10th field and app type 11th field in our index file which is fixed.
So this account number and app type combined is kind of primary and foreign key between cif and our e-index file.
