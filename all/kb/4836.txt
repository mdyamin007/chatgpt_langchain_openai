To print micr font with micr ink on Prisma:
Because we have jobs that use micr font and print with micr ink and jobs that use micr font and print with regular ink, we have 2 micr fonts on the Prisma system, one with the micr ink bit turned on and one without. The font without the micr bit turned off is in the regular font folder: shared/font and the one with the micr bit turned on is in shared/micrfont folder. In order to use micr ink, we have to add the shared/micrfont path on the search path above the regular shared/font path. If a job does not use any eforms and does not require its own ticket, use the Std_Test_Micr.TIC ticket for test jobs and use Std_Prod_Micr.TIC for production jobs. To do so, just add a rule for your job to pull the Micr ticket. If the job uses its own ticket, add the micr font path to the ticket before the regular font folder. If a job uses micr font but does not need micr ink, you dont need to do anything special.
e.g. add rule to use the micr ticket if micr ink is desired:
e.g add micr font path to the font resource to the ticket if micr ink is desired:
