each time a process run it's info like process date and time , user, hostname, jobsel and data file etc. etc. recorded in a file by the script.
Example: $home_keep/keep/hfcums2.ran
the log_file function from func_set1.sh does this recording in ran file. example:
log_file$main_data_file
check the ran file to see if this info like the screenshot above is recorded with the current file you run.
