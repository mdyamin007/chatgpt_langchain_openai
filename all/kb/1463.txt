Sometime LogicalPage1 and LogicalPage2 are used in a project and also have duplex mode. After Calling LogicalPage1 and LogicalPage2 papyrus re-initiate margin, top left right alignment. So if we run a customer with at least 5 pages, then after creating 4 pages( by calling Logicalpage1 and Logicalpage2 ),and re-initiate margin and alignment by newly calling Logicalpage1 and we easily check the margin effect and alignment position appropriately.
