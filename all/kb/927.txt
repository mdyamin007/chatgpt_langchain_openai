Often when we run infotrac job again it got hanged at certain point and we need to enter Y and then 11 to pass this situation. We normally something like this in the screen when it got stuck.
You see it is hanging while executing the /home/dsi/master/chk_job_id.pl program. This program is being called from another program named/home/dsi/master/get_infotrac.pl and this is called from isisdisk if infotrac flag is on.
if [ ${infotrac} -a ${infotrac} = "m" -a ${jobsel} = "s" ]; then
     infotrac="y" #reset infotrac variable
     export infotrac="y"
     if [ ${bypass} = 0 ]; then
          if [ ! -n "$4" ]; then
               echo -e "Error: Infotrac requires automated job must have segment. Please check with I.S."
               exit 1
          else
               segment_num=$4
          fi
     fi
     if [  $infotrac -a $infotrac = 'y' ]; then
          echo " ${home_master}/master/get_infotrac.pl ${cid} ${jid} $segment_num"
          perl ${home_master}/master/get_infotrac.pl ${cid} ${jid} $segment_num
          if [ $? != 0 ]; then
               subject="$0: $cid - Error in get_infotrac.pl program."
               message="Please verify DT_JOB_ID from insert file. Call I.S. for assistance."
               if [ $jobid != "888888" -a $jobid != "999999" ]; then
                    perl ${codebase}/daily_mail2.pl 2 "$subject" "$message" "dp@infoimageinc.com"
               fi
               echo "$0: Error $subject" >> ${targetBase}/${daily_log}
               exit 1
          fi
     fi
fi
In this program it actually checks if a job with certain dt_job_id is run again. In that case:
if bypass value is false then it will exit. Otherwise it will ask for user input saying:
print "Job: $dt_job_id has been processed before. Is this a re-run (Y/N)?\n";
In this case just enter Y and then 11. And if you look above snapshot you will know it will work to pass this hanging situation.
