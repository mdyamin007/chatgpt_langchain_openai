all the tax rules applicable for current year are demonstrated. But to work we don't need to go through all the pages ( it may be of 150 pages or more )
First we need to go page 10( or something around it to see the what are the new changes for each from ). The section name is Whats New for Tax Year 2021
All the new changes are mentioned here :
So for example from above snapshot for 1099-PATR two amounts are added and their mapping are also given.
You can also see the differences I mean what is new for a specific form by looking at the last year front and current year front .
So if something has changed for a specific from mentioned in this page you might need to change in the associated project/dfa.
So for most of the tax forms there are two types of records A and B. A is for bank which occurs only once in the data file and B for each customer.
Below is the section where mapping for each field for each records(A,B...) are explained( around page 43).
You can find the mapping for record A in the pdf ( around page 50 )
short summary of record A:
For each form entries are come from record A and B.
those marked sections comes almost in every form and those comes from record A and B. Rest of the fields come from also B but from specific.
So the common fields for all forms are:
Lender's address - comes from record A (53-239 ), most of the case left top box of the forms
Lender's federal identification no - comes from records A (12-20)
Borrower's federal identification no - comes from records B(12-20)
Borrowers's address - comes from records B(248-498)

you will see the exact associated amount(where you see $ sign) fields in the form also ( that matches the description of this publication pdf):
Now to finds these mappings go to page where the summarize mappings is given for record B in the publication pdf( around page 76):
