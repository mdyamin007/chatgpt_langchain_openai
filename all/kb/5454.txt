Andrea, did you ask the customer to complete the questionnaire?
Last, since API for e-tax is mentioned but GMBK is not our customer yet. You need to assign this ticket to ISD to assess and have ISD provide setup hours.
Normally at the year-end multiple persons get involved in doing the tax-related rush update. It would be problematic if someone holds the tax resources in dev/parallel and we are waiting for him to release them. So for this Terrence has the below 2 suggestions:
*Hi Rony,
The changes made to the DFA is either cosmetic or customize. We dont have time to wait for customer to approve.
Release the code
Or sync the code after approval (assume your approval AFP is generated from your local machine)
Thanks*
Terrence
