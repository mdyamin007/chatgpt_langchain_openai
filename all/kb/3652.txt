For estatement the outputs are individual afp files ( one afp for each customer ) and index file which contains different info mentioned below which is used by estatement team to post on estatement site. You can also see the output in account management tab in infotrac after running process if e_automate flag is on in control file. Each afp ultimately sent to customer through email that is why it is called estatement electronic statement.

Procedure
File/Directory To Test
Log File Test
* Check ISISDISK Log file to see if there is any error
* Check STDOUT log file for ISD index file name / Zip directory
ISISDISK log:
$dir/$cid$jid$segment${cycle}9.log
Index creation & naming check
* local index created.
* Index copied to ISD directory
* go to ISD directory and check naming
Local index:
stmt: $dir/${jid}_pdfidx.txt
daily: $dir/${fn}_enotices_pdfidx.txtISD directory:
$d_dir/isd_input/I3/process-files/${cid}/ISD index name:
doc format: ${jid}_${enddate_yyyymmdd}_${segment}_${processdate_yyyymmdd}_${processdate_HHMM}_${cid}.txt
afp format: ${jid}_${enddate_mmddyyyy}_${segment}_${processdate_mmddyyyy}_${processdate_HHMM}_${cid}.txt
Zip creation & naming check
* Take the zip name from ISD index
* go to AFP Archive directory
* check if zip exist
* check if zip naming is correct
(zip naming doesn't have a strict rule)
* ISD Zip directory:
$d_dir/isd_input/indiv_afp/${cid}/afp-archive/${prefix}-${enddate_mmddyyyy}/* Zip name:
doc format: ${prefix}_${cycle_no}_${segment}_${processdate_yyyymmdd}_${processdate_HHMM}_${seq}.zip
afp format: ${prefix}_${cycle_no}_${segment}_${processdate_mmddyyyy}_${processdate_HHMM}_${seq}.zip
Index Format test
* Check SOW to find Index format
* There are two format: doc format & afp format
* doc format is new and have a header
* afp format is old and doesn't have a fixed format
* Open index file (in ISD directory) to check format
* SOW
* Index file
Index content test
* Open index file (in ISD directory)
* Check if required fields are there
* Check if the values are in correct format
* Check if values are in correct place
* Index file
Individual AFP creation & naming check
* Open Index file and count Total pdfs
* Go to individual afp directory and count total pdf
* Total pdf listed == total pdf created
* Check Naming
* Local Individual afp directory:
stmt: $dir/${prefix}-indiv/
daily: $dir/enotices/* Individual afp naming:
${prefix}_${document_end_date}_${acct_no}_${sequence}.afp
Individual AFP view check
* Convers 2/3 afp files to PDF file
* Downlaod PDF file
* Open PDF and check if view looks alright.
* Check the image count from index files
* Individual afp files
Zip file content check
* go to zip directory
* List files in zip file
* Check total count with index's total count
* Check if afp count matches with 'afp_split_count'
* Zip file
Account Number Check
* There should be same account number in afp name and in index file
* Check Account numbers in Index file
* Check Account number in afp file name
* We use member number/Account number. Make sure correct account numbers are pulled from data file
* Index file
* Individual afp file
Auto Post
* If there is no online proofing there should be auto posting
* Open control file
* check the veriable:
stmt: e_automate="s"
daily: e_automate="e4"
* ${prefix}.control
