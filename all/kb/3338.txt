Just a reminder, this is a global generic script to copy files to client_pickup /home/master/copyToClientPickup.pl:
It standardized vcp copying to clieck_pickup.
Advantage also is that it keeps a log of all the files copied to client_pickup folder: /d/ftpbu/client_pickup_log/
Control Path Arguments :
Refer to example (/home/control/wfcumv1.control):
ftpserver_path=
alternative_ftpserver_path=  (secondary ftp server to copy)
Advantage also is that it keeps a log of all the files copied to client_pickup folder:
/d/ftpbu/client_pickup_log/
alternative_ftpserver_path flag is not required. Itsoptional.
It is used in the event that you need totemporarilymake a second copy to a 2ndftp client_pickup folder. We created this flag for the following business use case:
Client requested to migration from one server to another. However, client is not on time and constantly changes their mind on the live date. So we added this flag so we can release the code early by defining theoldserver with alternative_ftpserver_path flag and thenewserver in the ftpserver_path. This will be less disruptive in scheduling our code release date and we can release the code early. When they are finally move over, we can simply delete the alternative_ftpserver_path flag in the control file.
