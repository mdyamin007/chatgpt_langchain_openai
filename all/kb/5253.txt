If your project prefix exists in paperless.list file but there is no entry for ESUP_BY_ACCT field in insert file then you will get an error like below
To Solve this issue, make sure that you added ESUP_BY_ACCT entry like ESUP_BY_ACCT : <path_to_paperless_file> e in insert file
N.B => add 'e' at the end of paperless file otherwise mail_code 'e' wont come in writerecord txt file and e.Sup entries also won't come in dpvs. Besides entries for pilot will go in another category and you won't see output there for it. So be cautious about adding mail_code 'e' at the end of paperless file.
If you want e-Statement suppression then you will have to make sure 2 things
i ) add your project prefix in paperless.list file
ii) add ESUP_BY_ACCT entry in insert file with correct path
If you want to skip e-Statement suppression then
i) remove prefix from paperless.list file
ii) comment the line of ESUP_BY_ACCT line or remove the line from insert file.
There is another error that you may face that paperless file path doesn't exist which is pretty self-explanatory. As DP team set paperless file when they run script so paperless file path may be changed couple of times so it's a good practice to check whether the paperless file exists or not when you are going to run your script for e-Statement suppression.
Another thing to keep in mind that, for daily applications data file date (cycle) should match with the date of paperless file name.
