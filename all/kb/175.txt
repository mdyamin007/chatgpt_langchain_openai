it is actually combining a group of records in txt file ( <prefix><segment><cycle>.c1bmock ) based on account number or address or may be some other fields
it is actually setting the eoc flag(332-334) properly and calculating the group sheet(340-344) and group image(335-339) count properly
the group sheet and group image count are same for each record in a group
in a group eoc flag of the last record is 1 and for the rest of the records in that group eoc flag is 0
Grouping is necessary if we want to sent multiple statements in a single envelope, so we need to group the records in the txt file based on address or account or some other values as per requirements
There are several scripts for grouping like:
/home/dsi/master/combine_daily_addr.pl - group by address
/home/dsi/master/combine_daily_acct_addr_group.pl - group by account and address
/home/dsi/master/combine_acct.pl - group by account
and so on........
/home/dsi/master/c1bmcok_validator.pl is the script which validates the c1bmcok file after householding
below is an example of when house holding is applied toc1bmock file:
the marked fields are eoc flag group image count group sheet count respectively.
each group starts with 0 ends with 1
group image and group sheet count are same for all records in a group
