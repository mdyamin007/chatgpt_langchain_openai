If you face any gpg related error, that says key not found in the program /home/util/decrypt2.sh.
First, check if you have these link created in your home directory.
Example:
[anwarH@dsi .gnupg]$ cd /home/anwarH/.gnupg
[anwarH@dsi .gnupg]$ ls $PWD/* -la
-rw-------. 1 anwarH DSI 7680 Jun 16  2017 /home/anwarH/.gnupg/gpg.conf
-rw-------. 1 anwarH DSI    0 Jun 16  2017 /home/anwarH/.gnupg/pubring.gpg
-rw-------. 1 anwarH DSI    0 Jun 16  2017 /home/anwarH/.gnupg/secring.gpg
-rw-------. 1 anwarH DSI   40 Jun 21  2017 /home/anwarH/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg
You should have pubring.gpg and secring.gpgfile in there.
If you don't have them, do the following.
cd ~/.gnupg
ln -s /home/dsi/keep/gpg_key/pubring.gpg pubring.gpg
ln -s /home/dsi/keep/gpg_key/secring.gpg secring.gpg
Below one is optional (only if above doesn't work)
ln -s /home/dsi/keep/gpg_key/trustdb.gpg trustdb.gpg
If you still not available to find yourself not them working, please ask someone in the InfoImage to make them for you.
NOTE: /home/keep/gpg_key/ and /home/dsi/keep/gpg_key is the same folder.
