Processing step
DDA
/home/master/fcsb_dda_process.sh
Calls /home/master/fcsb_dda_process.pl
/d/ftpbu/fcsbbu/
FNBT*DD1*.PGP (for fnbt)
FHNB*DD1*.PGP (for fhnb)
/home/keep/cksum_log/fcsb_dda_cksum.log
/home/insert/fnbtms1.ins & /home/insert/fhnbtms1.ins
will get the message managers for fnbt and fhnb
preprocess data files to data dir /d/fcsb/stmt_dda/ with /home/master/fcsb_parse_data.pl
paper does not include DD1H files (these are only included for estmts)
split the data files to commercial (print image) files or personal (flat) files
format the Commercial statements (fnbtms1 and fhnbms1)
format Personal DDA statements (fcsbds5 for fnbt & fcsbds6 for fhnb)
combined the statements together so it becomes one application per CID for DDA (fnbtms1 & fhnbms1)
all paper processes will be in /d/fcsb/ for both fnbt and fhnb
estmt process will be in /d/fnbt/ or /d/fhnb/
check images for both will be in /d/prep/fcsb/tiff/ with subfolder for each CID
Saving
/home/master/fcsb_saving_process.sh
Calls /home/master/fcsb_saving_process.pl
/d/ftpbu/fcsbbu/
FNBT*SV1*.PGP (for fnbt)
FHNB*SV1*.PGP (for fhnb)
/home/keep/cksum_log/fcsb_saving_cksum.log
/home/insert/fnbtms2.ins & /home/insert/fhnbtms2.ins
will get the message managers for fnbt and fhnb
preprocess data files to data dir /d/fcsb/stmt/ with /home/master/fcsb_parse_data.pl
paper does not include SV1H files (these are only included for estmts)
split the data files to commercial (print image) files or personal (flat) files
format the Commercial statements (fnbtms2 and fhnbms2)
format Personal Saving statements (fcsbds7 for fnbt & fcsbds8 for fhnb)
combined the statements together so it becomes one application per CID for Saving (fnbtms2 & fhnbms2)
all paper processes will be in /d/fcsb/ for both fnbt and fhnb
estmt process will be in /d/fnbt/ or /d/fhnb/
Papyrus DFA
Commercial DDA uses FCSBMS99.dfa 
\A as new statement anchor
\P as new page anchor
\I for check images
Everything else is print image and printing as is
Commercial Saving uses FCSBMS11.dfa
\A as new statement anchor
\P as new page anchor
Everything else is print image and printing as is
Personal DDA and Savings
Uses FCSBMS21.dfa
handles 4 applications
-fcsbds5 - FNBT DDA (fnbtms1.dat.personal.flat)
-fcsbds7 - FNBT Saving (fnbtms2.dat.personal.flat)
-fcsbds6 - FHNB DDA (fhnbms1.dat.personal.flat)
-fcsbds8 - FHNB Saving (fhnbms2.dat.personal.flat)
