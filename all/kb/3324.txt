Example Output:
- look for specification in SOW. Different project has their own check image printing style. Below is an example of check image specification of reference project PLBKMS1:
- Check for inbound and outbound file naming convention in SOW. Below snap is from SOW of PLBKMS1:
- The check image file format differs from project to project. The extension of the check image file may be ".img" or ".x937" etc.
- Check images are usually in tif format. These tif files are extracted from the check image file (eg. .img or .x937 file).
- In the processing script get_chk_image.pl is used to extract the check images. See plbkms1_process.sh as a reference.
- get_chk_image.pl uses a configuration file, which is like /home/test/control/{cid}_image.control. In this control file all check image related file name pattern and directories are assigned.
- The ${prefix}.control file should have the following variables:
g_cripple_report="${dir}CRIPPLE.dat"
g_max_cripple_num="3"
tiffdir="$d_dir/prep/plbk/tiff/"
