Tap Test
Tap test is necessary to see if the address and top logos are visible through the window, no critical information should be visible through the window, like transactions, account numbers, etc.
To Test, normally we print the pdf (the first page usually ) and fold it 1/3, and insert it into an envelope to test.
Every envelope has one or two windows, you should confirm that the customer address and bank address is always visible through the windows.
