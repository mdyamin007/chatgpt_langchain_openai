Last time the above error occurred with Rahat for FNBKYL1 under Nischala.
And Nischala found out that if mail_full_serve is ASE1 that error didn't occur for ASE3 that error came.
So bottom line if you got this error just check themail_full_serve value and change it ASE1 to see if the errors occur or not.
