Sometimes infotrac flags are on but the we don't job see the job in infotrac job status tab. Possible reason:
default dt job id was used, 88888 or 99999. Pleask ask dt job id from PC for that application.
Sometimes you just see entry in job status tab and don't see individual entry and dt job id is also valid. In that scenario:
please inform the Is manager. They will probably ask Anil or David.
