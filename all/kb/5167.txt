Remove pdf and index file creation and writing to index file code from dfa
pdf_file_name group index value will be the value of pdf created from existing dfa
Also index file name that needs to be defined in pdf.control file should be same as created from existing dfa.
If any other code in dfa with pdfi option like logo display or text display should be replaced by 'e'
In script pdfi options should be replaced by e option
Need to change the procs file too to replace pdfi by e
After isisdisk call we need to add the pdf and index file generation code ( afp2pdf call ), normally in the script we don't need to do anything in the script for archiving.
You need to match the zip count+naming , pdf count+naming, index file naming+content for old code vs new code. All should be same. May be the serial of pdf in each zip will not be same but the total count should be same. Same goes for index file content , may be serial of each line will not match.
