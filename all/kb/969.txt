The mail id is really a number that identify the sender. The sequence is really the sequential number for each mail piece.
If the mail id is 9 digits in length, then the sequence number can only be 6 digits. However, if the mail id is 6 digits in length, then the sequence number can be up to 9 digits which mean the sender can tract more mail in a given period.
Ifboth the mail id and sequence number is 9 digits in length which is wrong.
The error message might look like below:
Database ( not sure yet which database ) should have mailer ID for each customer.
mail_full_serv="ASE3" define in the control file is for customer who has its own mail id.
If you process it on any linux box, the mail id is coming from database table
And it is transparent to you. But if you are testing at your work station. You will need to define the mailer id yourself.
