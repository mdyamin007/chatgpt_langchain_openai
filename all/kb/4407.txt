This video tries to describe papyrus code execution flow through debugging. From where code execution starts, how it continues and ends. In short, the sequence of doc formats per execution flow are:
BEFOREFIRSTDOC: it only executes once for single data file. It executes at the beginning of 1st document/customer. Here we declare global variables.
BEFOREDOC: it executes at the beginning of each document/customer. Here we declare variables that need to be initialized for each customer/document.
Top DocFormat( name does not matter) in DocumentFormat Definitions window. It executes repetitively until ENDDOCUMENT command is found. Here we normally read a single customer data from the data file and save in array.
AFTERDOC: If exists it will be called after ENDDOCUMENT command, meaning at the end of each document.
AFTERLASTDOC: It will be called at the end of the last document. Any codes that need to be executed after processing all customers should go here.

This video shows how the execution switch from DocumentFormat Definitions window to FormatGroup , Logical pages, Footer, PrintFooter. This is important to understand because here we display common information for all pages ( like bank logo, return address , page number etc etc.) and also calculate all page related variables ( logical page , physical page, tray sheets etc etc).
In short executions switches from Document Format Definitions to Format Group Definitions window:
If all the text inside an outline exceeds current page ( precisely bottom margin of current page which I forgot to mention in the video), as soon as the execution passes the outline it will move to format group footer sections and will continue to execute footer until the text stops overflowing.
When the EndGroup command gets executed.
