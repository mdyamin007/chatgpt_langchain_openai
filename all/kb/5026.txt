Error: function insert_data()
Error within program: dpvs_rpt.pl
Error within program: isisdisk.sh
+ chk_exit_status_w_email 1 isisdisk.sh
Possible Reason: so in insert_data there is a query to insert some data in some table but due to not having the permission of the user this error happened.
Possible Solution: the user needs to be added in is_user table. Please ask IS manager to add the user in is_USER table, or just pass the error message to IS manager saying that other member don't get this error but this person does. This will be also the credential for etaboard site.
