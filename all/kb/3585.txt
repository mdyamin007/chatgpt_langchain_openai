Its for s(paper) option.
with the data file and format dfa a big afp gets created with papyrus call (say from isisdisk.sh). You can see this kind of output in the log file/terminal.
the red marked portions are data file, afp, dfa, txt index file. The afp and txt file naming is $d_dir/<cid>/<prefix><segment><cycle>.txt. The txt index file is the file generated
by writecrecord command in data file.
After that with the txt file get split in several smaller txt files based on criteria by isiszipsep_new.pl script. Criteria can be say domestic address, foreign address, invalid address, heavy, suppressed from print (set by mail code z), paperless(e.sup), etc etc. Those txt files normally get generate in $d_dir/afp/cid directory.
Example:
or can be in working directory ($d_dir/cid/) too.
each extension has a meaning. Check this attachment for that.
File ID Standard_06.30.10
check the below link to see an example of dpvs:

You will see various information like page count, account count for each of those splitted files , grand total, tray count, insert count, msg mgr info, data file name etc etc. Also you will see
2d prefix, print format, job number, app no , vid at the top.
With most of those split txt files later print dfa gets to run. Print dfa selection can be based on tray simplex duplex criteria. Like 2DSD2IND.dfa means this print dfa will be used for that project which have 1st page simplex subsequent pages duplex.
you might see output like this in log file/terminal:
the marked portions are input file , output afp and dfa (print dfa). This dfa will be run with each of those split file and will produce related afp( also called print afp ) as you see in the above snap.
