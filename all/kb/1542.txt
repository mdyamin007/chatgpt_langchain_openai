Configuring Multiple Gateway
If anyone needs to connect with multiple network with the same interface, please follow these steps.
These are windows commands, Ubuntu has interface to do this.
First add those networks in your settings
Note: This will be the main gateway if there is no metric defined and all of the gateway is alive. Than Click Advanced.
Note: Add those network addresses and their gateways.
Note: This metric is used to prioritized the gateways. Lower number will be preferred first. That's it.
Static Routing:
By default the higher metric gateway will be used for all communications.
To change these behavior, do the following
1. If you followed the previous steps and wanted to access the 10.0.0.1 network, First see if there is any entry in your routing table regarding it by running this command in CMD or in PowerShell with Administrative Privilege,
ROUTE PRINT
2. If it doesn't run this command
ROUTE ADD 10.0.0.0 MASK 255.255.255.0 10.0.0.1
Similarly if you only want to redirect a single IP to that gateway, do the following,
ROUTE ADD 10.8.5.77 MASK 255.255.255.255 10.0.0.1
3. Finally make sure your entry is added successfully to the routing table by again typing
ROUTE PRINT
4. Follow these steps for multiple IP routing.
Have a good day
