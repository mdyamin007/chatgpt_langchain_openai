Key points:
In 2 words data process and statement generation.
Sample/Statement/Output can be in 3 types:
Paper: This will be printed, folded, and inserted into an envelope and mailed to the customer, meaning a physical copy of the statement.
Estatement: Electronic copy which will be emailed to the customer.
Archival: Bank will archive the statements( in pdf zip, or searchable DVD) .
Our coding can be divided into 2 parts:
Dfa: Which we do in papyrus designer and does the data parse and produce statement/output.
Script: This mainly searches the data file that the client will send and preprocess it if necessary then call the dfa program, produce output, and post-process( which is a big step).
Our whole process flow in short:
