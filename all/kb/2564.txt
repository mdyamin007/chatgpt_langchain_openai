2 Digit code, that specifies the account type.
Used in both Paper writerecord and e-statement index.
In Paper Writerecord:
This is used to check with paperless file, where it matches with the account number and app code/type found in the paperless file with the account number and app type found in the writerecord.
If matches script will suppress paper writerecord and sets the 'mail code' to 'z'.
If you look at the third column (usually) in the paperless file, this means you are required to put proper app type in your writerecord.
If you don't find this app type in your paperless file, then this is somewhat optional for the paper writerecord.
In E-Statement:
If it's failed to mention in the index file, the e-statement posting will fail.
This is a must for E-Statement!
Not Applicable:
Put 'NA' if app type is not applicable.
Possible Error:
Failing to implement app type correctly can cause
Some unwanted account can get suppressed
E-Statement post can fail
