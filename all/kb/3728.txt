ReturnMail
If for some reason the physical statement doesn't reach to customer it gets back to client(cu/bank). And the bank/cu address is displayed in top left of the statement which is visible through upper window of envelope. After that the bank may contact their customers.
But sometimes infoimage itself handles this part , in that case instead of returning to bank/cu it gets returned to infoimage and infoimage just reports to the bank/cu.
some discussion with Tun:
I don't know exactly what financial institution will do. But most likely, they will contact their customers, if the mails are returned. So basically, most of the FI get back those mail, if we use bank address in envelope. Now, they want us to review those rtn mails and they just want only report. That's why, we use Info addr for return mail.
per coding wise:
only two things make sure. 1, use our Texas addr, 2. mail-tracking is on (in control files). The rest are handle by OPS.
