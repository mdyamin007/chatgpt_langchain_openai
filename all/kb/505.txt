For the client who has check images, they might want a commercial cd archival system for check image searching. For jef reference as an example:
http://track.infoimageinc.com/issues/43370
In sow:
So the goal is to build a cd/dvd search system where statement and all the check images used the in that statement can be found/searched. There are already standard scripts built to handle it but we have to generate proper index files in dfa and generate pdf from scripting sides before using those standards.
Client will send a master file which includes information for customers for whose the commercial cd the will be applicable (at this moment I don't have much idea about that file ). Normally Dp put this file in /d/pdf_afp/cid/prefix/master_list/ before run .
Isd side also has a lot of functionality about this also. The actual code for building cd interface is on their side. So we have to let them know after our processing to check .
Also if process failed there might be a possibility there are something pending in isd side which needs to be done.
And normally Dp got involved to burn into cd in production , also in pilot and parallel if you need to provide cd sample ask Dp to run with a cycle. Please see the discussion in https://app.na3.teamsupport.com/  17904.
