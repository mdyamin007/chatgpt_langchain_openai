For example, if cid is bkpl but client is sending file in jha/bkpl/ meaning if the file path another directory appears before cid directory you need to declare and export Getfilecid in control file and value will be 'jha'.
Getfilecid="jha"
export dir procdate fn supprefix esup_ignore Getfilecid
Reason for using:
Use it if Incoming file path has 'JHA' or 'OSI' in it.
From Terrence: It has to do with incoming file path. When our process try to process file. It first check against the incoming file system which was create by ISD. However, there are two core (source of data file), like osiw and Jack Henry (JRA) where incoming file has their own sub-folder. So Peter introduce this environment variable so that our process can match ISD incoming file system. The file matching include file path.
