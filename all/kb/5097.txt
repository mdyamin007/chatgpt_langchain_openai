As we already know for the paper option big afp and txt/index gets generated. When we run script after generating big afp and txt/index these get processed by another dfa called print dfa which actually makes the afp ready to be printed by afp printer by adding necessary information as 2d bar code or omr or imb bar code.
There are quite a few print dfas already built. We need to use/declare which print dfa we need in control file based on our project requirement ( simplex/duplex/tray). For example, if for your application 1st page will be printed using tray1 sheet and simplex mode and subsequent pages will be printed in tray2 sheet and duplex mode then you need to use 2DSD2IND where the SD2 means 1st simplex simplex, subsequent page duplex, total 2 trays.
