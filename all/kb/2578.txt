From William:
I now see the screenshot below and confirmed my assumption is right. Per my other email, there we multiple Access Denied records in the database. The File Size column is empty for those transactions, hence you got that error message below. Now that the database is cleaned-up, Ive rescanned the files.
The root cause of the Access Denied issue is because the the .backup directory had permission issues where the scanner could not write to it. The .backup directory is used whenever the scanner attempts to overwrite an existing file. Before it overwrites the existing file, it backs it up to the .backup directory.
There were over 20 directories in general that had this issue. I deleted all the .backup directory so that scanner can re-create the directories in the future with the write permission.
There were other regular directories that had this issue which I fixed last Thursday/Friday. Hopefully there are not new issues other than the java exception that I reported to David.
