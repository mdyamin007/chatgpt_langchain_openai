When we run afp2pdf associated log file is also generated or results are appended in a log file which is/var/log/apache2/error.log.
So if you want to troubleshoot in case afp2pdf fails to generate pdf then you can search through log file.
You have to ssh topreprocessing03 by
ssh preprocessing03
then you can access/var/log/apache2/error.log
It is a read only file. You can search here by cid to get the result quickly.
