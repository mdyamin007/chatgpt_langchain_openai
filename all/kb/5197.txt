Sometimes it can be really useful to jump into another machine over the network and do everything from there rather than doing it from your local machine.
For example, review large pdf samples or running a long running processing script.
Steps to follow:
Open "Remote Desktop Connection"
In the text box put this ip "10.5.20.110" and click Connect
It will ask for username and password, for username it will be "infoimage\<sharepoint username>" and password will be whatever sharepoint password is.
That's it.
