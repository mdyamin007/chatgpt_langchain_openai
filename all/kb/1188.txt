Rony,
Currently, our system is set up with the following hierarchy.  Please save so that it can be referenced in the future:
Any accounts with mail codes for special handling have the highest precedence. For example: non-print, return,  mail with no insert, etc.
during the postal processing step, the postal software will look for country name at the end of the last line of the address block.  Those will be identified as foreign if they are not special handling accounts
any pieces that the ncoa processing indicates having change of address for over 95 days will be moved to the 5.2oz file to mail out with first class postage
An address that the postal software is able to match against its database and has provided the information to generate the IMB barcode, the piece will be moved to one of the presort files, 4.2o1, 4.2o2, etc with the exception that if the zip code on the mail piece is different from the one returned by the software, it will be moved to the 5.2oz file.
Pieces that do not have a 5digit zip code printed will be moved to the .mis file
All the remaining pieces will go to the 5.2oz file
Also, there is an error code of 'E101' at the end of the .mis records.  Whenever there is an error code, it indicates that the ACE software was not able to find a match of the address against its database and will  not return the imb info.  Here's the error code summary (don't worry about the Count and % columns, this is for a different job):
