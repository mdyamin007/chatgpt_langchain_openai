Check Inline checkbox if you need to resize the logos. Specially needed for check images where the psegs are not static or fixed or pseg will come dynamically but you don't have idea about their size and you need to display those with certain size in the output.
By checking the Inline checkbox the Dimension and Sizing and Color option will be enabled. Dimension will be boundary for the psegs and Sizing will determine the size of the psegs with respect to the boundary( like scale to fill will resize the psegs to fill the boundary defined by Width and Height of Dimension option)
