If you want to define it in font definitions to use your own name:
Here is the syntax if you want to use directly rather than using font definition:
FONT REFERENCE('XZAR00(10,100)')
ALIGN LEFT
'THIS IS SIZE 10'
FONT REFERENCE('XZAR00(10.5,100)')
ALIGN LEFT
'THIS IS SIZE 10.5'
FONT REFERENCE('XZAR00(11,100)')
ALIGN LEFT
'THIS IS SIZE 11'
Outline fonts begin with "XZ" file naming conventions. Not all of our fonts have Outline versions yet; If you want to check if the font exist, type:
ls -l /isis/fontsout/XZ{2digitfont}*.* (e.g. ls -l /isis/fontsout/XZAR*.*)
If you need it, just let Peter and I know.
