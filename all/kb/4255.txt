Problem:
Find out how many accounts were affected for a specific data scenario. If Yes, can we develop a logic to handle this?
Solution:
Download all the previous data files from the production
Combine them in a single data file. (Data file was MRD, basically line data)
Load it in open refine as "Line-based text files" data type
Copy existing extraction logic from a previous project that was done several months ago
Apply that extraction logic to the new combined data file and hit "Perform Operations"
This will give you the data/columns that you previously extracted.
Run some "Facet" operations to find the logic you are looking for
Flag those rows that are affected
Run "Facet by flag" to find out the whole accounts
From here you can analyze those accounts and come up with a solution for them.
If you want to extract those accounts for use in Papyrus, you can do so by
