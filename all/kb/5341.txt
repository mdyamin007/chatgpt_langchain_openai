If you face an error like below,
That means the, the cycle(dd portion) of your data file isn't included any of the approved campaign in pilot or stage. So, to fix this issue you can follow any of the 2 steps below:
1. Create a new campaign in pilot/stage where you are going to run you script as if your campaign's start date and end date includes the date of your data file. Then approve your campaign.
2. Un-Approve an approved campaign to edit it's start date and end date so that it covers the date of your data file then again approve it.
After that, run your script again. Hopefully you won't face such error again.
