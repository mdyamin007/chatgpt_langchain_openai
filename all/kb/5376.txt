At the time of calling afp2pdf , you may face an error like below,
If pdfs are generated but PDF count : 0 is showed that means the script afp2pdf_index_file_builder_multicore.py isn't searching the pdfs where they are actually generated. Now let's look at the part below of the script form where the error is being throwed
That means, for example if you pass OutputFilePath = /z/pdf_afp/apcu/apcudld/pdf then this script is actually searching for pdfs into apcudld folder whose names are within pdf*pdf. If you want that script should look inside pdf folder for *pdf files then you must have to add an extra / after the pdf like OutputFilePath = /z/pdf_afp/apcu/apcudld/pdf/. In afp2pdf call
After this modification in afp2pdf call you wont face such error again.
