title: Infotrac User Delete
body: This feature will enable Infotrac admin users to be able to delete users from
Account center module. Deleted users are no longer visible on account center
module.

  

 _ **Hyper link showing delete option on Account center tab:**_

  

  

 _ **Specifications:**_

  * Even though we name hyperlink as delete, we are not deleting user completely from our database. This is to maintain records on audit log.
  * We have introduced 2 new columns namely "status" and "status_changed_by" on usr table in Infotrac database. Deleted users will store status as "2" and status_changed_by will user_id of user who deleted.
  * During user deletion, we will change existing user name on usr table so that customer can reuse old name again.
  * We will update user name with certain naming convention. Convention rules are as follows. Example "shel_infoimage_deleted_1577226030949". Old user name is shel_infoimage. New user name is appended deleted and milliseconds of time  when user got deleted.
  * Deleted user will no longer be able to re login again.
  * We have modified audit logic to show information of delete operation. We can filter audit log report to see deleted users.
