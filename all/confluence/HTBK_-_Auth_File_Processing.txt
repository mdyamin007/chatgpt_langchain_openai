title: HTBK - Auth File Processing
body: ## Auth File Processing

HTBK's auth file processing is set up to maintain only the primary account
relationships. For business users who have sub-users, the sub-users are
maintained only through SSO.

## SSO

Retail users log into SSO via NCR (DI). Business users log into SSO via BB.

### Business Rule

Primary users who have logged in via SSO will not be removed in the post-
process even if the account relationships are removed from the auth file.

#### Technical Implications

  1. Users who logged in via SSO will have the UFA.source set to SSO. These users will now be referenced as SSO Users.
  2. Auth files will ignore UFAs with UFA.source == SSO. 
  3. SSO Users can only be removed through the Delete User function on the Admin Site. (see  for more details)
    1. Primary SSO Users will be reverted to having UFA.source == DSO, allowing the Auth file to remove the corresponding account relationships if they are no longer in the Auth file
    2. Business Sub-users will be removed
