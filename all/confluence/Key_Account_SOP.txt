 **The Key Account Overview**

The Key Account process was developed to address specific quality verification
needs for a set of Key clients. These are clients where the standard operating
procedures are not deemed sufficient based on the recent client experience,
operational challenges, or a request from the client-facing team.

  **Key** **Account** **Setup**

  * Key Accounts CIDs are marked with a $$ in their CID on TeamSupport. Example. "GCBK **$$** (**) - Gate City Bank"
  * An email request will be sent to the ISD Manager to add the client to the Key account list. 
  * The End of Month Alert summary document will be updated by the Operations Management team to include the client on the Key Account list. 

 **Process** ** - Interdepartmental**

  * An ISD representative will attend weekly interdepartmental meetings to identify and address any trends or changes that may impact code quality, timing, or accuracy of jobs released for Key Accounts

 **Process - ISD**

  * Release documentation is required for each release for a Key-Account client. Release documentation will need to be signed off by a senior-level engineer that witnessed both the commit, release and post-release checks
  * Code commits will need to be reviewed and double-checked by a senior level engineer or higher prior to client review.
  * Any processing related releases post-release will need to be monitored for at least the first three production cycles.
  * Any TeamSupport tickets related to Key Accounts will be given priority scheduling and resolution

 **Escalations**

  * Any quality issue identified on a Key Account is escalated via the ticketing system as an "Escalation" for immediate resolution via the ticketing system.
