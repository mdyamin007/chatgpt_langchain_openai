title: Supported CSV column, variable format and description
body: ## Supported CSV column

templateId = template service template id (Mandatory column)

subject = To replace template subject line.

from = To replace template from.

fromName = To replace template from name.

to = Recipient address. (Mandatory column)

toName = Recipient Name.

replyTo = To replace template reply to.

replyToName = To replace template reply to Name.

type = Type of the notification. (Mandatory column)

carrier = Previously before nexmo inplimentation for SMS, notify service use
email gateway to send SMS, not it's not used by any feature, to send SMS we
simply give "na" as carrier.(Mandatory column)  
  

  

## Supported Variables

```

udv_txt_{variableName} = User defined text type variable which is mainly used
to replace variable in body and subject line

sdv_txt_{variableName} = Same as udv_txt_{variableName}

tdv_txt_{variableName} = Same as udv_txt_{variableName} (OfferMgnt use this
type)

udt_url_{variableName} = User defined URL type variable which is mainly used
to replace variable in body and subject line (previously it was separated from
text time so we can make trackable URL from it, no that feature is absolute.
So now there is no basic difference between  _txt_  and  _url_  )

sdt_url_{variableName} = Same as udt_url_{variableName}

tdt_url_{variableName} = Same as udt_txt_{variableName} (OfferMgnt use this
type)

udv_bar_{variableName} = With the provided text of this variable,
notifyservice will be make a BR code image and attach it with the email. also
add a tag reference of that image to the body.

sdv_bar_{variableName} = Same as udv_bar_{variableName}

tdv_bar_{variableName} = Same as udv_bar_{variableName} (OfferMgnt use this
type)

udt_bar_{variableName} = Same as udv_bar_{variableName}

sdt_bar_{variableName} = Same as udv_bar_{variableName}

tdt_bar_{variableName} = Same as udv_bar_{variableName} (OfferMgnt use this
type)

udv_qr_{variableName} = With the provided text of this variable, notifyservice
will be make a QR code image and attach it with the email. also add a tag
reference of that image to the body.

sdv_qr_{variableName} = Same as udt_bar_{variableName}

tdv_qr_{variableName} = Same as udt_bar_ (OfferMgnt use this type)

udt_qr_{variableName} = Same as udt_bar_{variableName}

sdt_qr_{variableName} = Same as udt_bar_{variableName}

tdt_qr_{variableName} = Same as udt_bar_{variableName}

tdt_qr_{variableName} = Same as udt_bar_ (OfferMgnt use this type)

sdo_attach_{variableName} = (System defined object for attachment) With this
variable type we can directly add attachment file link, this link may contains
sdo_txt_/udo_txt_{variableName} type variable. There are two way to give URL.

```

Example:

> 1\. Add URL as column header:
>

>>
sdo_attach_stmt=<http://internal.afp2web.server/get_stmt?account_num=${sdo_txt_acctnum>}  
> This total line is a column header, rest of the column is empty. From this
> column we will pick the URL, replace sdo_txt_/udo_txt_{variableName}
> variable's value of the URL.
>
> 2\. Also you can give URL as column value.

sdo_txt_{variableName} = Contains value which be used to replace variable
attachment URL

udo_attach_{variableName} = Same as udo_txt_{variableName}

umo_attach_{variableName} = Same as udo_txt_{variableName} this is for mounted
attach

udo_txt_{variableName} = Same as sdo_txt_{variableName}

udp_txt_{variableName} = Passthrough variable from Job CSV to Report CSV.
Meaning, there may be several column which may need to be carried to report
CSV for reference. (OfferMgnt use this variable to pass various variable to
clicktrack record)

udf_txt_{variableName} = Mainly introduced for OfferMgnt, to add footer test
at the end of the email we use this variable

sdm_txt_{variableName} = Store info for track.

  

## Usage Example:

 **udo_attach_{variable} / umo_attach_{variable}**

  

Attachment can be attached in two way

From a GET API or from mount path

URL or mount path can be provided with a veritable udo_attach_test01 and
umo_attach_test01

 **udo - user defined object for attachment**  
 **umo - user defined mounted object for attachment**

if every recipient get same file then use CSV column header like this  
udo_attach_test01=<https://abc.xyz/mydocs.pdf>  
udo_attach_test01=<https://this.service.com/api/v1/getAsset?name=common.pdf>

NB: this column will only have header and

udo_attach_test01=<https://this.service.com/api/v1/getAsset?name=common.pdf>

this whole text is a header.

if every recipient get different file then use CSV column header like this  
udo_attach_test01=<https://abc.xyz/${udo_txt_accountNumner}.pdf>  
udo_attach_test01=[https://this.service.com/api/v1/getdocs?acctNum=${udo_txt_accountNumner}&name=statement.pdf](https://this.service.com/api/v1/getdocs?acctNum=${udo_txt_accountNumner}&name=statement.pdf)

NB: same as before

you will also need to give the reference column this time caz you have used
another referance veritable udo_txt_accountNumner

referance column will be like -  
udo_txt_accountNumner  
1  
2  
3

so for row number 1 when notifyservice will try to fetch the attachment from
the url it will be like

udo_attach_test01=<https://abc.xyz/1.pdf>  
udo_attach_test01=[https://this.service.com/api/v1/getdocs?acctNum=1&name=statement.pdf](https://this.service.com/api/v1/getdocs?acctNum=1&name=statement.pdf)

lets say your URL pattern is completely different for each row, for this
situation that column will be like

udo_attach_test01  
<https://abc.xyz/1.pdf>  
<https://def.pqr/my_attachemnt.png>
