## Step-by-step guide in Setting Color Message Manager up

The below are the steps to get Color Message Manager setup for your client

  1. AM/AC submits a TeamSupport ticket to add functionality.
  2. For Color Message Manager, list the CID, applications that this will apply to and add Message Manager in Color as of xx/xx/xxx date
  3. Please include Inventory Specialists in all tickets.
  4. The ticket is assigned to Infocare Team.
  5. Programming resources are required.
  6. The ticket becomes a programming request.
  7.  _An addendum is generated for pricing_
    1. Programming hours are provided separately
    2. Message Manager estimated timeline for programming, parallel and go-live is 15 business days
  8. AC updates the SOW and provides updates via a turnover meeting. For older SOW, the business rule section is appropriate. For New SOW, Under Section 2.2 Elected Features, Message Manager would be appropriate to add a "color" designation.
  9. For Message Manager, Accounting will bill from the Addendum information and the DPVS which will indicate the message manager color functionality is turned on.
  10.  _Clients are charged for color messages regardless of whether the graphic upload is in color or monochrome._
  11. Ops will validate the message prints in color based on standard operating procedures for messages. This is the standard process as part of the end of the month print process for validating messages. There is no change in the process needed.
