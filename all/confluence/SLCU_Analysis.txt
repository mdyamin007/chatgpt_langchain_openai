### Database

 **USR_SESSION** : Account number as _sess_login_id._ DSO is null.  
 **USR_MAPPING** : No data.  
 **NOTIFICATION_PREFERENCE** : No data. Uses CONTACT_INFO table.

### Login Method

SSO7

### SSO (SSO7)

  * Only account number is needed for successful SSO, email is not mandatory.
  * Does not update email.
  * Account number will be zero-padded at the front if length is less than 10 digits. 
  * Will create login if user is new.  

### DSO

N/A

### Leading Zero Account

  * No leading zero trimming while SSO. 
  * If account number is less than 10 digits long, it will be zero-padded at the front to make it 10 digits long. 
  * Database stores the account number with leading zero.
  * In ROOT site, account numbers are shown by trimming leading zeros.

### Welcome Email

N/A

### Enrollment

N/A

### Statement Types & Archival Period

Eight types of statements are:

  * ESTMT_DOC: default, escrow, visa_gold, visa_plat, visa_duet, visa_mbs ==> 24
  * ENOTICE: enotice ==> 24
  * ETAX: etax ==> 36

### Delivery Preference

  * Paper = B, Paperless = E, New = N
  * Can't change delivery preference from ROOT/MSM site. 
  * Delivery preference can only be changed by Paperless process. 

### Notification Preference

  * Uses CONTACT_INFO table. No data in NOTIFICATION_PREFERENCE table.

### Concerns

  1. Users can view their statements even though they are in paper (B). 
  2. Account numbers are zero-padded while storing in the database. Hypercube has no such feature. 
  3. Only database stores the account number with leading zero. ROOT and MSM site shows account number without leading zeroes.

##  **PUI**

###  _ **Backend Processes**_

SLCU has 7 backend process:

  1. Afp
  2. Permission
  3. Insert
  4. Enotice
  5. Paperless 
  6. Etax
  7. Doc

#### Settings

  * global.multipleStmtType=true
  * global.multipleDocType=false
  * global.enableAccountType=false
  * global.autoRegister=true
  * global.ssoKey=sl1!c2@u

####  _ **Statement types and index file name**_

  * global.ms1=default
  * global.mv1=visa_gold
  * global.mv2=visa_plat
  * global.mv3=visa_mbs
  * global.mv4=visa_duet
  * global.ms4=default
  * global.dla=enotice
  * global.dna=enotice
  * global.es1=escrow

  

###  _ **Afp Process**_

Statements that will be processed by Afp:

Flags:

  * afp.compression=true

#### Handler (data):  _ _AfpStatementData6__  

 _ **fileName**  |  **acctNum**  |  **beginDate**  |  **closingDate**  |
**numOfPages**  |  **acctName**  | ssn | appType | messageIds_

  *  **Bold**  indicates mandatory field.
  * Set sequence number from  **fileName**. Split File_Name with "_", if length == 5 take arr[3] as seqNum else take substring from arr[3] from 0 to starting of ".afp" or ".pdf". 

#### Registrar:  _ _MessageEStmtRegistrar__

  1. Always creates a new account if not found. 
  2. As global.autoRegister is true, creates a new  ** _USR_**  and  ** _USR_SESSION_**  record. 
  3. Set DSO date in  ** _USR_SESSION_**  table. 
  4. Set account number as  _sess_login_id_  in  ** _USR_SESSION_**  table. 
  5. Does not create user mapping. 
  6. If a record is found in the  ** _FIN_ACCOUNT_**  table, update  _acct_owner_name,_  unless the name is "MEMBER". 
  7. As multipleDocType is false, data will be blindly inserted while registering statements. 
  8. Image_Message is true for " **default** ", " **visa** " and " **loan** ". Therefore registerMessage method will be called for those statement types. 
  9. As multipleDocType is false, email notification will be turned on. So  ** _EmailNotification.register_**  method will be called.

  

 **getFinAccount()**

  1. Search account with the  **account number** : 
    1. If not found: 
      1. Inserts into  _ **FIN_ACCOUNT**_  with the account number, name and set the status to NA,  **no acct_type**. 
      2. Create  _ **USR**_ _ _ and  _ **USR_SESSION**_  with  **account number as sess_login_id, DSO date.**  
      3. Insert into  _ **USR_FIN_ACCOUNT**_  with  **acct_id**  &  **usr_id**. 
    2. If found: 
      1. Updates the user's  **first_name**  to account name. 
  2. Insert into paperless ( _ **PAPERLESS**_ )
  3.  _FIN_ACCOUNT_ **:   type -> NA, Status -> A**.
  4.  _USR_FIN_ACCOUNT:  _ **ufa_status  -> active.**
  5.  _PAPERLESS **:**_    **p_new_status  -> B, p_old_status -> N. **
  6.  _PAPERLESS2:  _ **p_latest_status  -> B, p_old_status -> N.**

#### Mismatch with Hypercube Business:

  1.  ** _sess_login_id_**   **= acctNum**  instead of  ** _!usr_id_**
  2. Though  **autoRegister**  is set to true, no entry in  ** _USR_MAPPING  _**table. 
  3.  **DSO**   **date**  not null.

#### Changes Needed:

  1.  **Registrar  -> **
    1. Use  **HypercubeEStmtRegistrar**  as the registrar for Afp process instead of  **MessageEStmtRegistrar**. 
    2. In  **HypercubeEStmtRegistrar.registerMessages()**  method, add a check to  **cast data1 to AfpStatmentData6.**  

  

###  _ **Paperless Process**_

Statements that will be processed by Paperless:

Flags:

  * paperless.classPath=com.infoimage.processing.application.paperless.handler.SlcuPaperlessHandler
