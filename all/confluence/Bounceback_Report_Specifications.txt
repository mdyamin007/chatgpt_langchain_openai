title: Bounceback Report Specifications
body: ****

  

The bounceback report can be set up in various ways:

  1. One single file that contains all the bounced emails within a set period of time (e.g. last 30 days). 
    1. This is not preferred, since each month is not always exactly 30 days.
  2. Multiple files, each containing all the bounced emails for a specific statement type
    1. For example, one file can contain all Monthly Statements bounced emails, and another, all eNotices.
    2. The frequency of the files will be dependent on the frequency of the statement cycles. A Monthly Statement report will most likely be once a month, whereas a Notice file will most likely be daily. 

Disclaimer: There is some inconsistency with bounced emails due to different
policies by different email service providers, the report may not be able to
capture all bounced records. However, it should have most of them.

# Supported Feature

## Automatic Switch To Paper

The Bounceback Report is capable of keeping track of how many times an email
has bounced. It can be configured for an account to be automatically switched
back to Paper delivery status if the bounced count reach a certain threshold.
This feature is minimal, and does not take into account consecutiveness. So if
we set the bounced count to be 3, the account will be switched to Paper when
an email get bounced 3 times for specific email address, regardless of when it
happens. Even if the bounced occurrences happen years apart.
