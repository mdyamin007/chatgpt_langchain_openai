Discussion email subject: need epay as account details for two accounts of
demo

 **Destination account of a payment/payment source**

1\. epay front-end (hypercube/infoimage) fetch the fin account details by
acctNum. Showing account's epay details like min-amount, due-date, balance on
the bill.

2\. Payment service get acctId from front-end(hypercube/infotrac) and fetch
the fin account's details by acctId before call the epx.

  * The Payment service send acctNum, acctType and stmtType to the epx during a payment/payment source creation to uniquely identify the destination account.
  * The payment service get notification preference of an account from the fin-account details which is already fetched by acctId at the previous step and send the epay notification.

3\. acctId is stored in the epay_transaction table as destination account.

 **The tables are used by payment service**  
 **epay_transaction**  : This table contains the actual transaction of an
account. Only if the transaction is approved the by EPX at run time then we
keep a record of the transaction. The transaction status from this table will
be updated by a process whenever the epx settlement report will be parsed as
well as data file from merchant.

 **epay_epx_transaction**  : This table contains a record for each and every
EPX call from our payment service. Its actually a history table of epx call
from our payment service. Currently, we do the epx call for following items
and for each of them we have a record in this table:

  * auth transaction with zero amount.
  * payment source creation for both card and ach.
  * pay by card or ach or source and auto pay payment.

 **epay_pmt_src**  : This tbale contains the payment source that user created.  
 **epay_recurr_pmt**  : This table contains the information of scheduled
payment of an account.
