title: Contextual Search
body:   

  

Problem:

To get badCount and goodCount, we are immediately calling elasticesearch. As a
result we are not getting the actual count because some time elasticsearch can
not complete it's task immediately, some times elasticsearch takes some time
to do it's indexing.

  

Solution:

We will not calling the elasticsearch immediately. Rather than will will call
it 30 minutes later to calculate the badCount and goodCount. To achieve this
functionality, we will use ActiveMQ.

  

Config:

We have to add the following property into property file. This file will the
the application, how much delay we want to calculate the badCount and
goodCount.
