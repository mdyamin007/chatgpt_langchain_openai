# Introduction

  
  

## Purpose/Objective Summary

 **TODO: (Required)**  
  

## Scope

 **TODO: (Required)**  List out the itemized features of what's inside/outside
of the scope of current project/phase  
  

### In-Scope

  1. Feature #1
  2. Feature [#2](https://i3dev.easyredmine.com/issues/2 "Bug: test notif \(Closed\)")
  3. ...

  
  

### Out-of-Scope

  1. Feature [#3](https://i3dev.easyredmine.com/issues/3 "Enhancement: TEST: improvement on eSafetyBox \(Closed\)")
  2. Feature [#4](https://i3dev.easyredmine.com/issues/4 "Bug: test \(Closed\)")
  3. ...

  
  

## Assumptions

 **TODO: (If Applicable)**  List out assumptions made during this design.  
 **IMPORTANT:**  All assumptions need to be confirmed with corresponding
stake-holder during design review. Assumptions would likely become
Dependencies upon confirmation/design-review

  1. e.g. This tool is meant to be used by internal people only, hence it will only support FF/Chrome. No IE supported needed.

## Dependencies

 **TODO: (If Applicable)**  List out all dependency component/service/library
needed for this design

  1. e.g. jQuery Library v1.9.2 or above
  2. e.g. PC need to be responsible for entering XXX values into YYY input file

# Requirements

  
  

## Business Requirements & Use Cases

 **TODO:**   **(Required)**  List out all needs/requirement from business/end-
user perspective. Assign an ID for each requirement/use-case item for easier
reference in future

ID| Title| Details| ScreenMock| Importance  
---|---|---|---|---  
BRQ-01| Generic Search box| (example)  
 **Requirement:**  Instead of showing a drop-down to ask user to choose what
attribute to search against,  
just have a simple search box that will search against all potential
attributes like name/email/address/phone.  
 **Use Case:**  enter "ben" into search box, search results returned should
include both record of "Ben
[Chan/bchan@infoimage.com](mailto:Chan/bchan@infoimage.com)" as well as "Jim
[Wong/jwong@bigben.com](mailto:Wong/jwong@bigben.com)"| <attach file>| one of
following:  
P0-Show Stopper  
P1-High  
P2-Normal  
P3-Low  
P4-Nice To Have  
BRQ-02| ...| ...| ...| ...  
  
  
  

## Functional Requirements & Use Cases

 **TODO:**   **(Required)**  List out all needs/requirement from
engineering/functional perspective. Associate them with an ID for easier
reference

ID| Title| Details| Bus. Req. Ref.| Importance  
---|---|---|---|---  
FRQ-01| Generic Search by Sphinx| (example)  
 **Requirement:**  Instead of constructing the SQL statements for search,
utilize Sphinx to help build the index and support such generic search.  
 **Use Case:**  enter "ben" into search box, search results returned should
include both record of "Ben
[Chan/bchan@infoimage.com](mailto:Chan/bchan@infoimage.com)" as well as "Jim
[Wong/jwong@bigben.com](mailto:Wong/jwong@bigben.com)"| <optional>| one of
following:  
P0-Show Stopper  
P1-High  
P2-Normal  
P3-Low  
P4-Nice To Have  
FRQ-02| ...| ...| ...| ...  
  
  
  

## Performance & Scalability Requirements (SLA)

 **TODO: (Required)**  List out all needs/requirement from Performance
perspective. Associate them with an ID for easier reference

ID| Title| Details| Importance  
---|---|---|---  
PRQ-01| Fast Search response| (example)  
 **Requirement:**  All Search operation should return results within 100ms.  
 **Use Case:**  <enter if applicable>| one of following:  
P0-Show Stopper  
P1-High  
P2-Normal  
P3-Low  
P4-Nice To Have  
PRQ-02| ...| ...| ...  
  
  
  

## QA/Test Requirements

 **TODO:**   **(Required)**  List out all needs/requirement from QA/Testing
perspective. Associate them with an ID for easier reference

ID| Title| Details| Importance  
---|---|---|---  
TRQ-01| Selectable Search Box element| (example)  
 **Requirement:**  The search textbox AND the 'Search' button need to tagged
with 'id' value so that Selenium could select it for entering value and
subsequent submit  
 **Use Case:**  Rely on Selenium to submit random search terms and capture
response time as well as validation search results| one of following:  
P0-Show Stopper  
P1-High  
P2-Normal  
P3-Low  
P4-Nice To Have  
TRQ-02| ...| ...| ...

# Design

  

## Architecture & Workflow Diagram

 **TODO:**   **(Required for medium/large feature)**  Draft a diagram to show
how various functional component work with each other, also how data flow from
one component to another.  
  

## Data Model changes (ER diagram & ddl.sql)

 **TODO:**   **(Required if involve LARGE schema change)**  Draft a ER diagram
of the existing AND new data-model design. Highlight the entity/relationship
that is added/changed.

 **TODO:**   **(Required if involve schema change)**  Include a ddl.sql file
that could be executed against old schema in order to create/change
table/columns, as well as handling the corresponding data-migration if
applicable.  
  

## Application component functional details

 **TODO:**   **(Required if involve big architectural change)**  List out the
key class/method created/changed for this project. Highlight the changed
portion (e.g. additional param for a method)

 **Overview:**   **TODO:**  Provide an overview of what changes if not already
illustrated in the Architecture diagram above

Component| Class| Method| Params| Comments  
---|---|---|---|---  
...| ...| ...| ...| ...  
  
  
  

## Integration Points & Interface

 **TODO: (If Applicable)**  List out Integration Points and corresponding
interface

From Component| To Component| Details| Error Handling  
---|---|---|---  
InfoTRAC| PUI| DT_JOB_ID need to be synchronized by...| If DT_JOB_ID during
PUI processing is not found in ...
