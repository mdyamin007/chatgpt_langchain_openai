title: Send alert
body: Application will check mq connection every hour. If there is any connection
issue, application will send a alert stating that issue. There is no reconnect
logic with MQ as present in our application but we have implementation the
logic. So if application face any issue when producing a job, it will try 2
times to reconnect and if it can not establish the connection, application
will notify us through an email. If there is any stuck jobs available in the
application, application will notify us through an email hourly. To enable
above features, we have to add the following properties into uspsscanservice
property file.
