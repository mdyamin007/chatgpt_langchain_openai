title: Intro to JSON Template
body: # Template Creation

This JSON Template file has two major rules that need to be followed:

  1. Specify root/account tag
  2. Loop/iterate through tags using `dict`/`map`
  3. Generate a bar delimited line using `list`

Explanations are below:

## 1\. Loop/iterate through tags

The first thing you need to do is specify a root tag or account tag that this
script will traverse. There can be multiple root tags present, but there has
to be at least one present.

The rest of the extraction logic will go inside these root elements.

## 2\. Loop/iterate through tags

    
    
      
    

xmltrue

    
    
      
    

Assume you want to traverse through this XML file and extract some information
from the `account` tag.  
You can do it like this:

    
    
      
    

jstrue

or in short:

jstrue

    
    
      
    

## 3\. Generate a bar delimited line

Whenever you need to generate a line follow this step.  
This program interprets a JSON array `[]` as the extraction point.  
The `key` value of the array will be used as the line code/identifier of that
line.

    
    
      
    

xmltrue

    
    
      
    

In order to extract `account-number` and `address` tag's **value** or the
**attribute** `Type`'s value inside `account-number` tag

jstrue

    
    
      
    

the output will be like this:

true

    
    
      
    

 **NOTE:** Nested tags can generate multiple lines with the same line code.  
If `account` the tag comes multiple times inside the `parent` tag, the output
will be like this

true
