title: Filename Rules
body: # Global Rules

  1. Filenames must be in lowercase.
    1. For backward compatibility, we do support upper case. The handler calls toLowerCase() on the filename.
  2. Encrypted files must end with ".pgp"
    1. For backward compatibility, ".asc" and ".gpg" are also supported.
  3. Zip files must end with ".zip"
    1. Zip files that are also encrypted must end with ".zip.${enc}", with ${enc} being one of the supported encrypted file extensions.
  4. Filenames  **must not contain** semicolon ( ; ) or colon ( : ).
  5. If possible, the first four letter of the filename must be the sub-cid to denote which sub-cid the processing will be for. 
    1. e.g. FCSB (wholesaler) with filename **fnbt** fiiautufl1.pgp will let us know that this file is for FNBT
    2. This is important for wholesaler, but a normal client might become a wholesaler in the future, so it's best that all clients follow this convention.
