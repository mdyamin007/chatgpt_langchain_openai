title: Third-Party File Share Design Doc
body: # Introduction

  

## Purpose/Objective Summary

Allow eSafetyBox user to share file to third-party users whom do not have
account/login registered with eSafetyBox application.  
  

## Scope

  

### In-Scope

  1. Allow file share on both file/folder level
  2. Allow unregistered users to download file(s)
  3. Single file could be shared among multiple third-party

  

### Out-of-Scope

  1. Collaboration of file(s) is not needed at this time. i.e. no upload by third-party, no file modification, etc.

## Business Requirements & Use Cases

 **TODO:**   **(Required)**  List out all needs/requirement from business/end-
user perspective. Assign an ID for each requirement/use-case item for easier
reference in future

ID| Title| Details| ScreenMock| Importance  
---|---|---|---|---  
BRQ-01| Generic Search box| (example)  
 **Requirement:**  Instead of showing a drop-down to ask user to choose what
attribute to search against,  
just have a simple search box that will search against all potential
attributes like name/email/address/phone.  
 **Use Case:**  enter "ben" into search box, search results returned should
include both record of "Ben
[Chan/bchan@infoimage.com](mailto:Chan/bchan@infoimage.com)" as well as "Jim
[Wong/jwong@bigben.com](mailto:Wong/jwong@bigben.com)"| <attach file>| one of
following:

## Functional Requirements & Use Cases

 **TODO:**   **(Required)**  List out all needs/requirement from
engineering/functional perspective. Associate them with an ID for easier
reference

ID| Title| Details| Bus. Req. Ref.| Importance  
---|---|---|---|---  
FRQ-01| Generic Search by Sphinx| (example)  
 **Requirement:**  Instead of constructing the SQL statements for search,
utilize Sphinx to help build the index and support such generic search.  
 **Use Case:**  enter "ben" into search box, search results returned should
include both record of "Ben
[Chan/bchan@infoimage.com](mailto:Chan/bchan@infoimage.com)" as well as "Jim
[Wong/jwong@bigben.com](mailto:Wong/jwong@bigben.com)"| <optional>| one of

## Performance & Scalability Requirements (SLA)

 **TODO: (Required)**  List out all needs/requirement from Performance
perspective. Associate them with an ID for easier reference

ID| Title| Details| Importance  
---|---|---|---  
PRQ-01| Fast Search response| (example)  
 **Requirement:**  All Search operation should return results within 100ms.  
 **Use Case:**  <enter if applicable>| one of following:

## QA/Test Requirements

 **TODO:**   **(Required)**  List out all needs/requirement from QA/Testing
perspective. Associate them with an ID for easier reference

ID| Title| Details| Importance  
---|---|---|---  
TRQ-01| Selectable Search Box element| (example)  
 **Requirement:**  The search textbox AND the 'Search' button need to tagged
with 'id' value so that Selenium could select it for entering value and
subsequent submit  
 **Use Case:**  Rely on Selenium to submit random search terms and capture
response time as well as validation search results| one of following:

## Architecture & Workflow Diagram

  
  

### Workflow walkthrough

  1. File Owner initiate file-sharing
    * Each file/folder in non-system folders (i.e. Inbox/Sent/Trash folders) could be shared with third-parties.
    * Clicking on the 'Share' action button will initiate a server request to initiate the share capability
  2. Unique Access-Link generated
    * Only when a file/folder is explicitly shared (by File Owner clicking on the 'Share' action button), an unique link alias (i.e. AccessLink) is generated with default expiration date. The AccessLink would be a 10-char alpha-numeric string.
  3. Access-Link visible to File Owner on UI, enter email/phone and click 'Send' to confirm sharing
    * Newly created AccessLink will require File Owner to enter third-party's email (and phone if desire). File Owner could choose to change the default expiration date if desire.
    * Existing AccessLink would be listed to allow user to extend expiration if needed.
      * Email/Phone are not editable. If wrong value entered before, need to create new AccessLink with correct info.
    * 'Send' button is enabled next to the AccessLink entry when proper email address is entered.
      * 'Send' button is available for existing AccessLink as well in case email need to be resent to third-party
    * Once File Owner reviewed info and ready to notify corresponding third-party, click on 'Send' button.
  4. Email carrying the Unique Access-Link sent to Third-Party
    * Once the 'Send' button is clicked, AccessLink is sent over to corresponding Third-Party recipient.
  5. Third-Party click on AccessLink
    * When accessing the AccessLink, first requested page will prompt user for the email address as first-level of security check.
      * This is to prevent somebody get a hold of the AccessLink by overseeing a link/print/screen..etc.
  6. Validate against the EMail-vs-AccessLink mapping & Expiration
    * User entered email address is checked against database to ensure it matches because AccessLink is uniquely assigned to specific email address only.
    * If email address entered matches, then user will be prompted for a choice of Email/SMS to receive the one-time-use access-token.
      * If phone number was not provided by File Owner, then only the choice of Email would be available.
      * Third-Party do NOT get to see/enter new email/phone info. The email/phone entered by File Owner would be masked & used only.
    * 3 consecutive failed attempt of validation will disable the AccessLink automatically with specific 'Locked' status.
  7. Send AccessToken over Email/SMS by choice
    * Once user enter the choice, the FileAccess system will generate a one-time-use token and send over email/sms
    * The token will be validate for 30 minutes by default. (configurable per CID)
  8. Third-Party enter AccessToken
    * Upon successful validation of the one-time-use AccessToken, an Encrypted cookie will be saved for current access session.
      * Encrypted cookie will be saved a session cookie so that whenever browser window is closed, cookie automatically destroyed.
      * Encrypted cookie will be comprised of BrowserUserAgentString, IP-Address, Current Access Session Expiration Timestamp
      * Cookie is encrypted by SHA-256 with a secret key
    * 3 consecutive failed attempt of validation will disable the AccessLink automatically with specific 'Locked' status.
  9. Download File(s)
    * Once all authentication checked successfully, Third-Party would be shown the file/folder associated with the AccessLink only
      * Meaning even if same Third-Party is shared with two files from same File Owner, there should be two separate AccessLink. Each AccessLink can access the associated single file only.
      * If File Owner would like to share multiple files to a Third-Party with a single AccessLink, FileOwner could place all files needed within a single folder and share the folder.
    * When Third-Party download the file(s), all download event are logged into the system as history records
    * All the history records will be available to File Owner's regular eSafetyBox History tab.
  10. File Owner receive email notification about the download event (by profile preference)
    * Whenever a file is downloaded, an email notification would be sent to File Owner.
    * An option is exposed in File Owner's profile to control whether an email notification should be sent or not
