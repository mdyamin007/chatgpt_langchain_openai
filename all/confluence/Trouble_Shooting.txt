## Using both href and onclick on a single anchor
element[](https://i3dev.easyredmine.com/projects/reference/wiki/Trouble_Shooting#Using-
both-href-and-onclick-on-a-single-anchor-element)

When you rely on both href and onclick within a single anchor element to
control your page-navigations, browser may not honor your intended behavior
100% of time. Take a look at following sample code:

    
    
    <form id="createMessageForm" action="onclick.php?refresh=<?php echo empty($_REQUEST['refresh'])?'1':++$_REQUEST['refresh'];?>" method="post" >
        <input type="hidden" id="iteration" value="1"/>
    </form>
    <a href="page2.html" target="_blank" onclick="document.getElementById('createMessageForm').submit();return true;">Hello</a>

  
  

### To try it out:

You can place the above code in a php file and see how it behaves in your
local environment. Or test against this page:
<http://10.8.8.205/sandbox/onclick.php>  
  

### Problem:

It may appears it works for Firefox, but not Safari. But the real problem
being the "form-submit in onclick" will have a race condition with the "href".
If the form-submit get processed first, href doesn't get honored because the
page is already refreshed and the browser lost the context.  
  

### Then what to do?

It's bad practice to rely on a combination of onclick and href to handle your
page-refresh/new-page-open..etc. If you absolutely need to have such behavior
(i.e. open new window & refresh current page), do both action inside the
onclick. Especially remember to open new page in new window first, then
refresh current page. That way, you have absolute control over the sequence
and timing of the page navigation behaviors.
