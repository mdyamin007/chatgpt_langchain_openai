title: Deconversion Updates
body:   1. Get storage locations from database. Query must access default database since this is the only schema the storage_servers table exist

    1.   

Conf file will need to define storage server (a,b, or c) and the value will be
passed through the perl script as a parameter.

select mapped_name from storage_servers where name = ? and priority = 1;

  

  2. Print out the command logs in real time instead of storing it and printing it later. We should be able to review the logs as the program runs.
  3. Make docker-compose universal.
  4. Automatic splitting with zips. Maybe have java zip the files instead.
