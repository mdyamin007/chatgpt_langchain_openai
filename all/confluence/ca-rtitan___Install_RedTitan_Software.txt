title: ca-rtitan:  Install RedTitan Software
body: These are instruction on how to install the RedTitan Software.  This is
application for new and upgrade installation:

## Step-by-step guide

  1. Log into each ca-rtitan-pr-##.infoimageinc.com server via RDP
  2. Open browser to RedTitan Website and download either the current version or the previous version of the software into the server:  <https://www.pclviewer.com>

  3. Backup or Rename C:\Program Files\Redtitan if this folder currently exists.  The installation software will overwrite this folder if it existing.
  4. After downloading the RedTitan executable (e.g.:  EE1059d.exe version 10.59d), double click and install it to C:\Program Files\\.  Follow the installation steps from the software.
  5. After the software has been installed, rename the newly created folder C:\Program Files\Redtitan to the the new version.  For example, C:\Program Files\Redtitan_1059d  (since are using version 10.59d).
  6. Restore the original folder from Step 3 back to C:\Program Files\RedTitan if this folder existing when before you installed the new software.
  7. Now go into C:\Program Files\Redtitan_#####\Software folder and double click on the 'escapee.exe' executable and open the software
  8. After the software loads, click on the "File" menu and select "Install RTZ license file":

  9. Normally I would place the current license file in c:\Reditan_license.  If not, go to the correct folder to locate the RTZ:
