title: bounceback API enhancement design
body: The above picture shows our existing design for bounce back API. Existing work
flow can be found in [Jira
ticket](https://jira.infoimageinc.com/browse/DSIPD-1848)

  

As we are getting 504 status code for the mentioned API, here we are proposing
a design to solve the issue.

There are 3 steps of our proposed design.

Step-01:

PUI will call infoservice with a callback URL then infoservice produce a
message with necessary information and response 200 to the PUI.

Step-02:

infoservice will consume the message and produce the necessary report data
with the help of notifyservice. Produced data will be saved in mongoDB and
callback URL will be triggered to notify PUI that data is generated.

Step-03:

After getting the callback, PUI will call infoservice and infoservice will
send the data from mongoDB.
