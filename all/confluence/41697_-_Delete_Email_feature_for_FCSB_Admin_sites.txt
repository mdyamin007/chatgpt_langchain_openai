## Goals

  * To re-introduce the delete feature for the admin site.

## Background and strategic fit

FCSB was able to delete emails when the emails were stored in the
usr_fin_account table. When we switched to notification_preference, we removed
that feature. Now, the client would like to re-introduce the feature.

## Assumptions

  * For Paperless/Receiving Paper and Electronic, there must always be an enabled account. 

## Requirements

#| Title| User Story| Importance| Notes  
---|---|---|---|---  
1| Delete Option on Account Management| Add a checkbox so the user can flag an
email for deletion|  _Must have_|  
  
2| Delete validation| Validate the request so that we do not delete the only
Enabled email address if the account is on Paperless or Receiving Paper and
Electronic|  _Must have_|

  * Validation is done to new status, so if the client set the Delivery Preference to Paper, and delete an Enabled email, the request will be able to go through
  * Validation will be performed on the form with Javascript
  * Validation will be performed again in change_action_status.jsp, because Javascript can be disabled. 

  
3| Deletion code| Update change_action_status.jsp to delete the email address
when the deletion flag is turned on |  _Must have_|  
  
4| FNBT FHNB| Both FNBT and FHNB code must be updated|  _Must have_|  
  
  
## User interaction and design

Error when trying to delete the only enabled email
