  2. High-level implementation discussed & agreed.
  3. Given below changes were suggested by team:
    * REST API - add input params - "groupId", "expiryPeriod" and "senderEmailId" as a part of the MFA enhancements.
    * Change Secure Token generation logic to Alphanumeric(6). Currently, it's Numeric(6), which may repeat 1/20,000 instances. The alphanumeric (case insensitive) will give more ranges to avoid duplicate values.
