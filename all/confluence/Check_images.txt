Besides, Account Number must be used in conjunction with the Org_ID & Account
Type as Account Number could duplicate across Account Types.  
Application Type|  
  
Branch Number| Equals| BC: Don't think we should have all the comparison type.
It should only be 'equal'. Adjusted accordingly, please comment if disagree.
Besides, this should be a UTF8 string type, NOT integer.

  1. Initial concept for the search spec json structure:  

[  
    { 'key'      : 'account_num',  
      'operator' : '=',  
      'operand'  : '321789412'  
    },  
    { 'key'      : 'check_amount',  
      'operator' : '>',  
      'operand'  : '320'  
    },  
    ...  
]

    
                    
    

    1. All conditions will start as 'AND' only. Need further thoughts on how to support 'OR' or combination of 'AND/OR'
