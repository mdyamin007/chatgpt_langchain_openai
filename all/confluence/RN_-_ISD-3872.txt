Changes on:

  1. routes/mainRoutes.js
  2. client/config/router.js
  3. lib/allConstants/constants.js
  4. private/assets/demo/properties/properties.json

New File Added:

  1. public/assets/demo/resource/denyUnenrollAccessText.html

For this feature, we have to enable  **denyNonenrolledSsoUsers  **and
**eStatementEnrollment  **flag.

Also for the custom static page, we have to add an HTML page named "
**denyUnenrollAccessText.html** "  with custom text on it inside that client
resource folder.
