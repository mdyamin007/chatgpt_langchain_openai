title: Logstash Installation Steps
body: ## Cent OS

Run the following command to import the Elasticsearch/Logstash public GPG key
into rpm:

    
    
        
    sudo rpm --import <http://packages.elasticsearch.org/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch>
    

  

### Install Logstash

The Logstash package shares the same GPG Key as Elasticsearch, and we already
installed that public key, so let's create and edit a new Yum repository file
for Logstash:

    
    
        
      sudo vi /etc/yum.repos.d/logstash.repo
    

  

Add the following repository configuration:

  

    
    
      [logstash-1.4]  
      name=logstash repository for 1.4.x packages  
      baseurl=<http://packages.elasticsearch.org/logstash/1.4/centos>  
      gpgcheck=1  
      gpgkey=<http://packages.elasticsearch.org/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch>  
      enabled=1  
    
    

Install Logstash 1.4.2 with this command:

    
    
      
      sudo yum -y install logstash-1.4.2
    

  

**NOTE:**  Logstash is installed but it is not configured yet.

Logstash will get installed in following directory:

    
    
      
      /opt/logstash/
    

### Log Files:

Logstash logs: /var/log/logstash/

Zimbra Logs: /var/log/zimbra.log

### Logstash Contrib Installation:

Logstash 4.1.2-modified plugin is broken. So first, we need to change version
of logstash.

    
    
      
    

  sudo vi /opt/logstash/lib/logstash/version.rb

  Change

  LOGSTASH_VERSION = "1.4.2-modified"

  to

  LOGSTASH_VERSION = "1.4.2"

  

    
    
      
    

Now, we will able to install logstash contrib plug-in.

  

    
    
      cd /opt/logstash
    
      sudo ./bin/plugin install contrib  
    
    

### Configure Logstash

For zimbra log gathering, We have created postfix pattern file to filter logs.
Put postfix file at following location:

  

    
    
      /opt/logstash/patterns/  
    
    

Make sure owner of this postfix file should be logstash. Run following command
to make owner logstash.

    
    
        
      sudo chown logstash:logstash postfix  
    
    

Logstash configuration files are in the JSON-format, and reside in
/etc/logstash/conf.d. The configuration consists of three sections: inputs,
filters, and outputs.

I have attached zimbra.conf file. Copy this file at below location:

    
    
      
      /etc/logstash/conf.d/
    

  

Now restart the logstash by below commands:

  
    
    
      sudo service logstash restart
