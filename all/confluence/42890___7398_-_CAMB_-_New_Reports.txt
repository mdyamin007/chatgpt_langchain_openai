## Goals

  1. The first is from the Paperless Reports section. We would like the account level detail for the Acc. Opt-Out for the current month report for both deposit accounts and notices. 
  2. On the Latest Stats page, we would like to see the account level detail of Statements Viewed for Online Statements for the last 30 days, Statements Unviewed for Online Statements for the last 30 days, Statements Viewed for Loan Statements for the last 30 days, and Statements Unviewed for Loan Statements for the last 30 days. 

## Background and strategic fit

Client request.

## Assumptions

  * Both reports will be scheduled via the Report Scheduler, which means we must use report generators in upload2
  * Goal (1) will be accomplished by updating the AccumulativeOptOutReportGenerator
  * Goal (2) will be accomplished by creating a new ReportGenerator

## Requirements

#| Title| User Story| Importance| Notes  
---|---|---|---|---  
1| AccumulativeOptOutReportGenerator| Update
AccumulativeOptOutReportGenerator|  _Must have_|

  * need to support stmt_type and status parameter
  * stmt_type: default, enotice, etc. (accepts only 1 parameter)
  * status: E,U,W, etc. (accepts 1+ parameter(s))

  
2|  StatementViewStatus ReportGenerator|  Add StatementViewStatus
ReportGenerator|   _Must have_|

ACCT_NUMBER|ACCT_TYPE|STATEMENT_TYPE|VIEWED

  * support stmt_type and status parameter
  * stmt_type: default, enotice, etc. ; default to default
    * Can accept multiple stmt_type?
  * viewStatus: Y/N/Y,N; which view status for docs to include in report; default to Y,N
  * mapStmtType: true/false; true means use conf file to map STATEMENT_TYPE; default to false
  * mapEnoticeType: true/false: true means use DocDesc to map enotice type; default to false
  * eTax is always mapped, because eTax code is binary
  * daysPrior: how many days prior; default to 30
