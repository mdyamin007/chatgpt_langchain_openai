title: Deconversion Analysis
body: [Work] -

Before Assigning Hours -  
Check how many statements for each statement type.  
Check size of each pdf and afp file for each statement type.  
Figure out how big of hard drives we need to order on client's behalf.  
Figure out proposed dates depending on how long it will take to deconvert all
the statements as well as the archival period requested from client.

Provide hours, dates, count of each statement type for requested period, and
the format of the provided files.

Format structure -

Multiple zipped folders pertaining to usually a three month time span.

Inside will be different folders pertaining to the statement type - heloc,
analysis, mortgage, default, enotice, etax, ...

In the folders will be a summary file and a pdf folder for the statement type
pertaining to the 3 month time span.

Inside the pdf folder will be the pdf statements and an index file mapping
the pdf file name to the account number.

The index mapping file will be in this format - (account number| acct name|
type| closing date| pdf file name).

  

During Deconversion -  
Ask Network to mount the hard drives and to provide you the server & path of
the mount point. (You will use this for /etc/fstab file for mounting)  
Create docker instance and set up mount and start deconversion process.  
Do not delete zip files with pdfs unless needed for space, and if possible
keep it by copying it over onto a different server with more space (PV-NAS or
something)  
Copy over zipped files to hard drive.

After Finished Deconversion -  
Ship hard drive to the client.  
After they confirm they are able to access all statements, we can delete and
purge our database and delete the zipped deconversion files.
