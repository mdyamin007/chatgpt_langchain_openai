# Pathway Integration

* * *

InfoIMAGE sync the delivery preference of accounts to a third party vendor
called Pathway.

Whenever the delivery preference is changed anywhere, infoservice is called to
make an API call to Pathway to sync the delivery preference.

The integration is logged in various areas:

  1. Oracle DB: PATHWAY_LOG 
  2. Mongo DB

See . This is a very old document, unsure how true everything in it is.

## PUI

On the PUI, a report is generated for the client based on the logs recorded:
InfoXchange Report.

## Prism

The Infoservice Pathway URL is defined in the web.xml.
