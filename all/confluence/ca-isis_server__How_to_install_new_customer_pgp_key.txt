title: ca-isis server: How to install new customer pgp key
body: The following actions will need to be performed by IS managers and/or anyone
who has 'main' user account privileges

  

 **Setting up on production RHS server:**

  1. Logon to rhs as main 
  2. gpg --import $public_key_from_customer_with_full_path
    1. NOTE:  If you want to inspect or get information on the pgp public key  _before_ importing it, you can run the following two different commands:  

        
                gpg $public_key_from_customer_with_full_path  
        gpg --list-packet $public_key_from_customer_with_full_path

  3. Make a backup of the current shared pgp key since operator accounts are linked to the files in this /home/keep/gpg_key/ folder
    1.         export pgpdate=`date "+%Y%m%d"`

    2.         cp -p /home/keep/gpg_key/pubring.gpg /home/keep/gpg_key/pubring.gpg.${pgpdate}

  4.     cp -p /home/main/.gnupg/pubring.gpg /home/keep/gpg_key ##  operator accounts are linked to the files in this folder

  5.     gpg -list-keys

##  the last entry should be the newly added key

  6. email programmer(s) and DP with the new public key description from step 5 so that they are aware a new PGP was added.
  7. copy the pubring.gpg file to the texas DR server, 10.9.2.16:/home/keep/gpg_key folder by running the following command:

    
    
               scp -p /home/main/.gnupg/pubring.gpg main@10.9.2.16:/home/keep/gpg_key/

 **Setting up on RHT server.**

  1. Now login as main on rht server
  2. cd /home/keep/gpg_key
  3. Make a backup of the current rht pubkey.pgp file by running the following two commands:  

    
                 export pgpdate=`date "+%m%d%Y"`
    
                 mv /home/keep/gpg_key/pubring.gpg /home/keep/gpg_key/pubring.gpg.${pgpdate}

  4. Now run copy the latest pgp key from production

    
    
              scp main@rhs:/home/keep/gpg_key/pubring.gpg /home/keep/gpg_key/
