title: TLS/SSL Certificate Injection Process in Tomcat/JDK/Docker/Proxy
body: There are several places we need to add TLS/SSL certificate. Places are

  * Tomcat *.infoimageinc.com (tomcat.jks) TLS cert
  * JDK 
    * *.infoimageinc.com (tomcat.jks)TLS cert
    * JackHenry Cert (JackHenry.crt)
    * safecu cert (pwp.safecu.org.cert)
  * Haproxy (infoimageinc.com.pem)

 **In this document we'll see how to inject these certificate in above
applications.**

The applications/services that are deployed over **Jenkins,  **cert injection

For, DEV/PILOT/STAGE/PROD we've several git repository for application
configuration. So, you need to update the Certificate in Git-lab respective
repository.

The location of the cert for every repository is
