## Technical Design

  
| Name| Detail  
---|---|---  
1| Front-End Saving CID Configuration in State per Session| Each session will
obtain the CID configuration and store in state. If the configuration is
updated during a session, the new configuration won't be used unless the user
re-logins (start a new session). Situation is rare enough that we do not have
to worry about updating the configuration right away. Most users will always
have the latest configuration.  
2| ssoKeyGen and ssoExchange go directly to backend| VueJS applications are
unable to read POST requests.
