title: Design Doc to support alternative names (alias) for SSO Methods
body: ### Introduction

This design documentation is to represent the necessary information and
changes required to support different names (alias) for existing SSO methods.

### Purpose/Objective Summary

Currently, clients can only SSO via existing SSO methods and the methods
cannot be called with other names.

The main objective of this feature is to accept client provided SSO names and
redirect them to existing SSO methods like singleSignOn7, digitalInsightV2
etc. The alias name might be on the sso-keygen URL params or on the request
body. This name will be extracted and matched with the predefined alias-method
map and the client will do SSO via an existing method.

In InfoCONFIG side, there will be a SSO method properties with the client
selected alias name. This alias method will be similar to an existing SSO
method with some properties changed or exactly the same. In the Hypercube
side, this alias method name will be read from request URL or request body and
via a mapping the predefined SSO method will be executed with the new alias
method's properties.

### Scope

#### In-Scope

  1. Get the client provided SSO alias from the request URL or request body. 
  2. Map the alias name to existing SSO method name.
    1. If the client set an alias name, they always have to request with this alias name to do SSO via that method. For example, if the alias name is **NARMI** then they have to send request on **/NARMI**. They can't send request to "/" (default request) to execute the **NARMI** method. 
    2. The alias can be a default method. But to execute the alias method, the client has to send sso request to /alias-name. 
  3. Preserve the previous SSO method's businesses. 

### Requirements

#### Business Requirements & Use Case

ID| Title| Details  
---|---|---  
BR_01| Use alias name to do sso| Client will SSO into Hypercube with an
appropriate method and they will call the method whatever they like. We will
call it "alias".  
BR_02| Always request on /alias-name| The client will request on /alias-name
to do SSO via alias.  
BR_03| Alias as a default SSO method| The alias can be a default SSO methods
name but the client have to send request on /alias-name, not on "/" (default
request).  
BR_04| Both the alias and the regular method can be configured| If "NARMI" is
the alias for regular method  **singleSignOn7** , then both NARMI and
singleSignOn7 can be configured separately on InfoCONFIG.  
  
#### Functional Requirements & Use Case

ID| Title| Details  
---|---|---  
FR_01| Define alias-method mapping| Define an map object in constants.js.
key=alias, value=sso method name  
FR_02| Grab the method name alias from request url| The alias name will be
provided via request url and grab and match the name with alias-method keys.
If exists then the method name will be the key's value. If not then it is not
a valid alias.  
FR_03| Grab the method name alias from request body| If the method name is not
provided via request url then it will be grabbed from the request body.  
FR_04| Preserve existing SSO key gen business| If the alias method is not
provided or not registered, then the previous sso key gen business will be
activated.  
FR_05| Prevent "/" request if default method is alias| The client will not go
through SSO if the request is on "/" (default request) and the default method
is an alias.  
  
#### QA/Test Requirements

TR_01| Test alias feature for different sso methods|  
  
  
### Code Changes

Project file path| Method Scope| Changes  
---|---|---  
lib/allConstants/constants.js|  
| SSO_ALIAS_MAP object added on Meteor.App  
routes/mainRoutes.js| Router.route('/ssoKeyGen/:_method')| Logic added to get
the alias name and call the mapped auth method  
lib/allConstants/util.js| getMappedMethodForAlias(alias-name)| New method
introduced. Will return the existing method name mapped to the alias-name.
Will return undefined if the alias-name is not present on the SSO_ALIAS_MAP or
undefined.  
  
###  **Sample Data on SSO_AIAS_MAP:**

Sample Map Entries

SSO_ALIAS_MAP: {

        narmi: "singleSignOn7",

        alkemi: "q2sso",

        jackHenry: "digitalInsightV2"

}

  

  

Sample Request and mapping

  *  **https://demo.infoimageinc.com/ssoKeyGen/singleSignOn7  **this will be mapped to **" singleSignOn7"**
  *  **https://demo.infoimageinc.com/ssoKeyGen/narmi                    **this will be mapped to ** "singleSignOn7"**
  *  **https://demo.infoimageinc.com/ssoKeyGen/alkemi**                   this will be mapped to " **q2sso** "  
  *  **https://demo.infoimageinc.com/ssoKeyGen/**                                 this will not be supported if the default method is an alias name like narmi, alkemi or jackHenry
