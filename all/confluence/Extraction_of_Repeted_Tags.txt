title: Extraction of Repeted Tags
body: ## Problem:

Let's say we have a tag named ' _old_address_ ' that needs to be extracted in
the bar delimited file with each ' _old_address_ ' tag being on a separate
line with a line code.

Example XML:

xmltrue

## Solution 1:

### Template:

jstrue

This will produce the following lines

So, if there is more than 3 ' _old_address_ ' all of them will be captured
with this template.

## Solution 2:

We can approach this in other ways. Let's say, we **don't** want to capture
all of them, we only want the first 3. In that case

### Template:

jstrue

This will also produce the same output as Solution 1. The only difference here
is, there will be no more than 201 line, even if there is more than 3 '
_old_address_ '.

Another way can be to output them in a single line. You can do it in the
following template

jstrue

This will produce a single line like following
