title: Enrollment File Specifications
body: INLINE

These specifications are for StandardEnrollmentHandler and
StandardEnrollmentRegistrar.  **When providing this document to client, it is
best to download it as a Word Doc and then modify it to cater to the client's
needs. Typically, when we provide the generic file, the client tend to
turnover bad files due to confusion over the conditionals.  **

# Index File Content Specification

* * *

Fields are pipe ( | ) delimited.

Not all fields are required. Ordering of the fields is dynamic.

Required fields must have their values provided in their own columns even if
two fields share the same value.

Header Row: FieldName|FieldName|FieldName|..., e.g. UUID|User Name|...

  
| Field Name| Description|  **Required**  
---|---|---|---  
1| Unique User Identifier (UUID)| A unique ID to identify the user. Depending
on the client's setup, this can be the member number, the SSN / TIN, or a
unique ID generated by the FI or OLB vendor.| Y  
2| Subuser Identifier (SUID)| The secondary ID for the subuser to be combined
with the UUID into "UUID|SUID".| O  
3| User Name| The name of the user. This should be use for setup with joint
ownership when the user having access to the account may not necessarily be
the owner of the account.| O  
4| User Type| The type of user: Personal ( **P** ), Business ** ** ( **N** ),
Foreign ( **F** ), or Viewer ( **V** ).  If column is not provided, all newly
created users will default to Personal.| O  
5| Account Number| The account number.| Y

DD for Checking, SV for Savings, etc.| O  
7| Account Name| The name of the account's owner.| Y  
8| Email| The valid email address that the notification will be sent to.| Y*  
9| Attachment Password| This is the password with which to encrypt the PDF. If
the Notification Preference is  **attach** , this field must be provided. |
Y**  
10| SMS| The phone number that the SMS will be sent to.| Y***  
11| Paperless Status|

The paperless status to be changed to. For Enrollment File, it is typically E,
i.e. the purpose is to enroll accounts into Electronic delivery. However, the
processing also supports reverting to Paper (P).

Values accepted: **E** by default.  **P** and  **W  **(both Electronic and
Paper) can be accepted, but must be configured by InfoIMAGE.

|

O  
  
12| StmtType|

The statement type. Required for when the client has selective paperless.

Example:  **default** ,  **enotice** ,  **heloc** ,  **etax** , etc.

Support comma delimited fields, i.e.  **default** , **enotice** , **heloc**
mean set paperless status for the listed statement types to the value defined
in Paperless Status.

| O  
13| Notification Preference|

The preferred method of notification delivery.

Values accepts:

  1.  **attach** : The user will receive an email at the provided email address, attached with a PDF of the cycle's statement, which could be optionally password-encrypted
  2.  **email** : The user will receive an email at the provided email address, notifying that the cycle's statement is available on eStatement
  3.  **sms** : The user will receive a sms message at the provided sms number, notifying that the cycle's statement is available on eStatement

Empty value defaults to be  **email**.

Support comma delimited fields, i.e.  **email** , **sms  **mean notify both
via email and sms.

InfoIMAGE does not support attachment over sms, so  **attach** , **sms** does
not mean that an attachment will be sent over SMS. This will send an email
with the PDF attachment to the user, and an SMS notification without any
attached document.

|

O  
  
14| Modified Date|

The datetime to be set as the date of paperless status modification, typically
set to be the same datetime the index file was generated.

*Email field is required if and only if Status is not P and Notification Preference is set to **email**.

**Attachment Password field is required if and only if Status is not P and
Notification Preference is set to **attach**.

***SMS field is required if and only if Status is not P and Notification
Preference is set to **sms**.
