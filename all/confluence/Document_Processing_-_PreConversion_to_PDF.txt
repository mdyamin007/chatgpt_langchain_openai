## Goals

  * Enhance Document Processing to always pre-convert AFP to PDF for afp files that are sized 200 MB or higher.

## Background and strategic fit

Reduce load to afp2web server. Larger files take longer to convert in real
time, so we want to convert them beforehand. This way, the document will be
served in a reasonable amount of time for the user.

## Assumptions

  * We will enhance Document Processing only. Revisiting AFP Processing will be for later to keep the scope of the project small.
  * This logic should apply globally to Statement, Notice, and Tax (though Tax is not going through Document Processing yet).

## Requirements

  
| Title| User Story| Importance| Notes|  **Pilot**|  Production  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
1| Global Preconversion| As InfoIMAGE, I would like to pre-convert all afp
files of size 200 MB or larger to a PDF, so that the statement can be served
to the customer in a reasonable amount of time and does not strain the afp2web
server.|  _Must Have_|

  * Check AFP file size to determine the pre-conversion logic.
  * This should be global and always true (similar to AFP processing). However, instead of counting pages, we will consider actual AFP file size.

2| Client Specific Overriding| As InfoIMAGE, I would like to be able to
override the global pre-conversion configuration inside the client
configuration file, so that I can customize the pre-conversion logic by client
if necessary.|  _Must Have_|
