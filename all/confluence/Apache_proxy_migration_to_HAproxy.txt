title: Apache proxy migration to HAproxy
body:   

  

  

## **INFOTRAC**

We have introduced a new endpoint for all the prism clients to call from HA
proxy for checking if that node is still accessible from the proxy level.

The endpoint is

**/[heartbeat.do](http://heartbeat.do) **(ex.
[_https://infotrac.infoimageinc.com/heartbeat._](https://flcu.infoimageinc.com/heartbeat.jsp)
_do_ ).

  

This page only checks if this page is accessible from the proxy level.
Additionally, this endpoint will also support a query param
"?includeDBCheck=true"

(ex.
[_https://infotrac.infoimageinc.com/heartbeat._](https://flcu.infoimageinc.com/heartbeat.jsp)
_do_[
_?includeDBCheck=true_](https://flcu.infoimageinc.com/heartbeat.jsp?includeDBCheck=true)
).

  

If this param is passed from the proxy, it will check if the application can
access the database by executing a select query on the " **DUAL** " table".

To achieve this we are introducing a new controller which will  several return
response code based on the query params and the availability of the infotrac

application.

##  
 **PRISM**

  

We have introduced a new endpoint for all the prism clients to call from HA
proxy for checking if that node is still accessible from the proxy level.

The endpoint is **/heartbeat.jsp** (ex.
[_https://flcu.infoimageinc.com/heartbeat.jsp_](https://flcu.infoimageinc.com/heartbeat.jsp)
). This page only checks if this page is accessible from the proxy level.

Additionally, this endpoint will also support a query param
"?includeDBCheck=true (ex.
[_https://flcu.infoimageinc.com/heartbeat.jsp?includeDBCheck=true_](https://flcu.infoimageinc.com/heartbeat.jsp?includeDBCheck=true)
).

If this param is passed from the proxy, it will check if the application can
access the database by executing a select query on the " **Organization** "
table for that specific client. For example, "Select * from Organization Where
org_id=getordid('flcu')".

For this, we had to change the filter class of the clients who go through the
filter for each request, for other clients we just added the **heartbeat.jsp**
page on the ROOT side.

There is also a heartbeat to check if msm is accessible ex.
<https://flcu.infoimageinc.com/msm/heartbeat.jsp>

  

From the HA proxy following endpoint will be called and the following response
will be generated:
