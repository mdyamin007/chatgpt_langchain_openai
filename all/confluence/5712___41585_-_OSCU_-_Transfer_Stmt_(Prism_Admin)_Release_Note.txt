##  **Workflow** :

  * This feature will be accessible for only those admin users who have minimum sess_permission = 3
  * " **Statement Reassignment** " button which is the feature button, will be visible on the account details page. This button will not be visible for those users who don't have the minimum sess_permission.
  * After clicking the " **Statement Reassignment** " button, the admin user will be redirected to the statement reassignment page. On that page, there will be a section where the current account and current account name will be shown. This current account is that account from which we're transferring the statements. This can be considered as the source account.
  * On the right side of the current account section, there'll be another section where the destination account will be shown. A search box will be there to search for the destination account. After searching for the destination account, that account number and account name will appear in that section. If the account doesn't exist, an error will be shown saying the account not found.
  * If the destination account is found, then a " **Submit** " button will be visible on that page, otherwise, this button will remain invisible.
  * Admin users will be able to see the current account's available statements for transfer in a section under the current and destination account. Different statement types will appear there in separate tabs.
  *  Under each statement types tab, different year's statements will appear in different year's separated tab. Each of the statements has a select box in parallel. Admin users will be able to select multiple statements by clicking " **Select All** ".
  * There'll be a " **Reset** " button to reset all the selected statements.
  * There'll be a " **Submit** " button to submit the statements to the destination account. After clicking the " **Submit** " button, a confirmation page will be shown to confirm the destination account and the statements and statement type which were selected to be transferred.
  * After hitting the " **Confirm** " button user will be shown a successful message of transferring. 
  * There is a " **Cancel** " button on the confirmation page. Hitting this button, admin user will be redirected to the previous page.

  

##  **Questions:**

 **Question**|  Answer  
---|---  
The name of the feature button is currently set to " **Statement
Reassignment** " as we took IDCU as a reference. Should it be as it is or we
have to change it as " **Statement Transfer** "?|
