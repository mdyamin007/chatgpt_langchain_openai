title: Report Generation Script
body: We have some scripts for generating reports from logs. All these scripts runs
once in end of month.

 **Scripts location:  **/root/ directory of ca-apipui-pr-01.infoimageinc.com

 **Cron Job Expressions:  **

bashcron job expressions

  

To view cron job expressions, run this command on ca-apipui-
pr-01.infoimageinc.com as a root user :

bashcrontab

  

##  **Scripts and their Overviews:**

  

 **1.  Montly Report:**

Monthly report generation script runs once in end of the month and generate a
report for all the cid specified in the script. If new clients comes up, we
need to edit this script and add those clients in this script.

  

bashjaas_monthly_report.sh

  

  

 **2\. Monthly Report Without CID:**

We also have another script that can generate same report as above script but
in this script we don't have to specify cid names. This script can
automatically gets cid names from logs and then generate report for them.
That's why it takes 2x time than above script. The main advantage of this
script is we don't need to edit this script if any new client comes up.

  

bashjaas_monthly_report_without_cid.sh

  

 **3.Monthly Report Endpoints:**

This script generate reports for all the endpoints specified in the script for
particular cids. As different cid has different sets of endpoints we couldn't
make it cid less. We have to specify cid names hadr coded in the script.
Whenever a new cid comes we need to edit the script as well.

  

bashjaas_monthly_report_endpoint.sh

  

  

 **Black Knight Script:**

This script generate reports for black knight clients. Unlike previous scripts
this script parse application logs rather than access logs. This script is
also cid less. So we don't need to add cid explicitly and we don't need to
edit script whenever new clients of black knight appication comes up.

bashblack_knight_monthly_report.sh

  

 **Note: As you can see we have added only ca-apipui-pr-05 and ca-apipui-pr-06
server for this script. Because till date black knight is running on this two
instances only. In future, if we deploy black knight in other servers, then we
need to edit this script accordingly.**

  

To edit and maintain versions of these script we should maintain
[this](https://gitlab.infoimageinc.com/rriyad/api-report-script) gitlab repo.
