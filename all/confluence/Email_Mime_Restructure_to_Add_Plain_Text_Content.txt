title: Email Mime Restructure to Add Plain Text Content
body: Hello Ben,

I have implemented this feature across templateservice and notifyservice.

I am trying to represent our previous and current mime message architecture.

Previously we had -

Now I have restructured it as follows -

Hi Ben,

The client wants to send a multipart mime email to support HTML content first,
and a text only version for older clients and such.

I'm not too familiar about how to go about this but based on some research it
seems that will do.

Hello Ben,

Currently we have only text/html type of email body.

We can have this type of feature where same email object will have 2 type of
body one with text/plain and the other is text/html.

Let me know, then I will do some POC around it.

Thanks.

Naim,

That means we need to combine contents from two templates into a single
outbound email.  
In the CSV, it carry one templateId per row only. We need to evaluate from the
TemplateService, InfoTRAC E-Nofitication UI, CSV sample generation, PUI side
of change of CSV construction, etc.

Thanks.

Naim,

To make this easier, is it possible to just strip out all the HTML styling,
and grab the textual content only and take that as the 'text/plain' version?

Thanks.

I have done a little RND,

Ben,

While saving template we can get plain/text from tinymce, (which we are using
for SMS template). i don't know if it is a good idea that we can introduce a
new property names plainTextContent at template model where we can save the
plain test version of the content.

Also we can strip out all html tags on the fly, before sending the email. I
have written some java codes with regex.

Thanks

 **Ben:**

Exposing a 'plainTextContent' as optional value for each Template is probably
a better idea.  
But that means you will need to enhance the:  
1\. InfoTRAC E-Notification UI: to accept plainTextContent if enabled. (need
feature setting for this)  
2\. Template Service API & Oracle DB schema: to CRUD the additional
plainTextContent value  
3\. Notification API: to send email body differently if plainTextContent is
present.

Trisha, the response to client is going to be "This will be an enhancement on
the InfoTRAC roadmap, we are in R&D stage still, early evaluation shows we
should able to do this in 2017, but exact ETA will beTBD until we are done
with in-depth technical reviews"

Thanks.
