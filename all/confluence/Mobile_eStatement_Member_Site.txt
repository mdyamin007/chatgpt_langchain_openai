  * Action Items:
    *  **Ben** : plan for setting up the Mobile device detection and show separate page. Also the Desktop/Mobile toggle capability. It will be some time in mid/late Feb
    *  **Clark** : Flesh out the UI design more:
      * Would like to keep the implementation multi-tenant capable with certain level of customization.
      * Meaning most likely the page layout need to be fixed, only image/css styling could be customized.
