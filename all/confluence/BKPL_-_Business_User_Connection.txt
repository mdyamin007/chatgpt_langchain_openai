## Goals

  * Set up subuser support for BKPL where a member within a business have access to a subset of the entire business' accounts.

## Background and strategic fit

Client's request. Additionally, this is an issue that has a high impact to the
client.

## Design

Everything is dependent on NCR and what they can do.

Use digitalInsightV1 for the business users, since it supports accepting of an
account list.

Actions| Notes  
---|---  
Require NCR to pass a "login_id" field for the subuser information.  What the
login_id is can be determined by NCR as long as its alphanumeric, and unique
within a business.| Need to confirm also whether NCR can pass the correct
account types.  
Update digitalInsightV1 to support reading the login_id so that the field can
be passed to ssoEnrollmentApi.|  
  
For BKPL, the sso should check against primary user.|  
  
  
  

For the retail users, we have to change them from using v1. Here we have two
options:

Actions| Notes  
---|---  
Update V2 to have a "useDatabaseOnly" option.| This is actually more inline
with the V2 signature. It accepts only the user_fi_number and an email
address. However, instead of using it and setting it to be the only account
number, the new option will search the database instead.  
Create a V3.| V3 will be like V2 in the request signature. However, the
"useDatabaseOnly" will be exactly what V3 logic is.  
  
  

## User interaction and design

 **Retail**

Path: ssoKeyGen/digitalInsightV2 (or V3 - still being decided)

Params (line separated for clarity):

pswd=RETAILPWD

&user_fi_number=123456789

&email_address=dummy_email@email.com

  

 **Business**

Path: ssoKeyGen/digitalInsightV1

Params (line separated for clarity):

 **Business A User 1**

pswd=BUSINESSPWD

&user_fi_number=123456789

&email_address=user_1@businessA.com

&login_id=ABCD

&account_number1=1234567

&atype1=D

&account_number2=4445556

&atype2=S  
  
---  
  
This user will only have acccess to account 1234567 and 4445556.

  

 **Business A User 2**

pswd=BUSINESSPWD

&user_fi_number=123456789

&email_address=user_2@businessA.com

&login_id=DEF3

&account_number1=1234567

&atype1=D  
  
---  
  
This user will only have access to account 1234567.

  

 **Business B User 1**

pswd=BUSINESSPWD

&user_fi_number=222333444

&email_address=user_1@businessB.com

&login_id=ABCD

&account_number1=2344431

&atype1=D

&account_number2=6456344

&atype2=S  
  
---  
  
This user will only have access to account 2344431 and 6456344. One thing to
note is that the login_id for this user is also ABCD which is the same as User
1 for Business A. However, this is okay because the login_id is only required
to be unique within a business.

  

For the Primary Business user, they can either connect through the "Retail"
connection which will have access to ALL accounts, which is expected. Or they
can connect as a Business user where the account list provided during the sso
Request will be ALL accounts. The decision is up to NCR, but it has to be one
or the other for all primary users. It can't be that some primary users behave
one way, and some another way.

## Questions

Below is a list of questions to be addressed as a result of this requirements
document:

Question| Outcome  
---|---  
(e.g. How we make users more aware of this feature?)| Communicate the decision
reached  
  
## Not Doing

  * Changing NECU and PFCU. They really should be using the new digitalInsightV2 (or V3). But changing them now is too complicated. We can simply add in V1 that the ignoreAccountMatching should no longer be used for newer clients.
