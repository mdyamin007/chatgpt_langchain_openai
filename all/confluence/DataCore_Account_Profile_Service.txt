  * Comment from Diane:
    * For many customers the Total Accessible Balance and the Teller Authorization Balance may be the same.  
For the bank's knowledge, the only difference between the two fields is
whether or not the Exception Score Processing (ESP) amount is included in the
authorization balance.  
With the Teller Authorization Balance the ESP amount is optionally included.
An indicator on Bank Control tells the system to use the ESP amount or not
when calculating the balance.  
The Total Accessible Balance will always include the Exception Score Amount,
if one is available for the account.
