title: Silani's Constraints for sending Package
body: 1\. If signer is the owner(package sender), no notification is sent to the
signer for signing the package. It is an expected behavior of the system.  
2\. If sender information is used while building the silani's create package
api request, then that sender has to be first registered on Silani's server,
only then he can send the package
