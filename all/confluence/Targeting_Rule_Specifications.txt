## Populating new-rule UI from client settings json

Following is a sample client settings json.

{  
    "targetingRule": {  
        "tabs": [  
            "Standard",  
            "Segments and Formulas"  
        ],  
        "fields": {  
            "cifNumber": {  
                "fieldLabel": "Account Number",  
                "type": "number",  
                "parentTab": "Standard"  
            },  
            "age": {  
                "fieldLabel": "Age",  
                "type": "number",  
                "parentTab": "Standard"  
            },  
            "city": {  
                "fieldLabel": "City",  
                "type": "string",  
                "inputType": "text",  
                "parentTab": "Standard"  
            },  
            "state": {  
                "fieldLabel": "State",  
                "type": "string",  
                "inputType": "text",  
                "parentTab": "Standard"  
            },  
            "zip": {  
                "fieldLabel": "Zip Code",  
                "type": "number",  
                "parentTab": "Standard"  
            },  
            "gender": {  
                "fieldLabel": "Gender",  
                "type": "string",  
                "inputType": "dropdown",  
                "values": [  
                    "M",  
                    "F",  
                    "NA"  
                ],  
                "parentTab": "Standard"  
            },  
            "currBranch": {  
                "fieldLabel": "Branch Code",  
                "type": "number",  
                "parentTab": "Standard"  
            },  
            "segment": {  
                "fieldLabel": "Segments",  
                "type": "segment",  
                "parentTab": "Segments and Formulas"  
            },  
            "formula": {  
                "fieldLabel": "Formulas",  
                "type": "formula",  
                "parentTab": "Segments and Formulas"  
            }  
        }  
    }  
}

  
Under 'targetingRule' there are two elements  
1\. tabs  
2\. fields  
'tabs' contains names of tab elements. Under 'fields' every rules parentTab is
related to it and indicates under which tab this field will be shown. For
example in the following image Account Number is under Standard tab.  
  
For each rules under fields key,  
\- Property names (e.g. acctNumber) under 'fields' has to be unique cause this
key will be stored in collection and will be used to retrieve later. Also for
rule type 'number', this property will be used as column name.  
\- 'fieldLabel' will be used as title of the rule.  
\- 'type' represents the ruleType  
\- 'values' will be used to populate dropdown values which is not needed for
rule type 'number'  
\- 'delimiter' wiil be used only for ruleType 'fileData'. Delimiter value be
used to parse into the file data.

  

  

## Rule types

Based on the ruleType from client settings json the fields in the UI will be
different. So far following are the possible ruleTypes.  
 **1\. number**

> 1 operand 1 operator  
> View : one dropdown containing operators (>,<,>=,<=,=) and one textfield for
> number  
> Description : For number type the property name under fields will be
> considered as column name. The operators are populated from RULE_CONDITIONS
> from constants file.

 **2\. range**   **(Pending)**  
limit between two numbers  
View : two textfields  
Description :  
 **3\. string**

> given attribute (city, membership etc) is equals to selected value  
> View : one dropdown  
> Description : For string type the property name under fields will be
> considered as column name. 'values' array will contain values of the
> dropdown. (operator used '=')

 **4\. offerEvent**

> Active offer, respond type (Accepted, Ignored, Clicked etc)  
> View : two dropdowns  
> Description : For offerEvent type the UI will include one dropdown
> containing all active offers and another dropdown with values of 'values'
> array

 **5\. fileData**

> Selecting from dropdown the data type (Account Number, Zip code etc) and a
> file containing data delimited by client specified delimiter  
> View : one dropdown, one file input field  
> Description : The dropdown will contain all column names (acctNumber,
> acctType etc).

 **6\. Segments**

> Selecting from dropdown with all available segments  
> View : one dropdown  
> Description : Audience segment can be saved on a specified period of time on
> different action on an offer or campaign. The goal is to reuse this set of
> audiences directly for future offers.

 **7\. Formulas**

> Selecting from dropdown with all available formulas  
> View : one dropdown  
> Description : Formulas can be saved on different actions on multiple offer
> or campaign. The goal is to reuse this set of audiences directly for future
> offers.

  

## Mongo collection structure for storing target rules

Following is a sample json from targetingRule mongo collection

{  
    "_id": "j48uhJJTjw9xtm7EP",  
    "name": "SF-Gold60",  
    "cid": "root",  
    "appID": "offer",  
    "description": "Gold Members of San Fransisco who are Aged more than 60",  
    "ruleGroup": [  
        [  
            {  
                "field_key": "age",

                "operand": "Gold",  
                "operator": "="  
            }  
        ],  
        [  
            {  
                "field_key": "clickedOffer",  
                "attribute": "offerEvent",  
                "ruleType": "Events",

                "operand": "101,102,103,104,105",  
                "operator": "in"  
            },  
            {  
                "field_key": "formula",  
                "attribute": "formula",  
                "ruleType": "Segments and Formulas",  
                "operand": "9913e35c8e6eb535fb52fb1c",  
                "operator": "="  
            },  
            {  
                "field_key": "segment",  
                "attribute": "segment",  
                "ruleType": "Segments and Formulas",  
                "operand": "5913e35c8ee3G535fb52fbXc",  
                "operator": "="  
            }  
        ]  
    ],  
    "createdBy": "admin",  
    "createdDate": {  
        "$date": "2016-11-03T08:59:39.338Z"  
    },  
    "modifiedDate": {  
        "$date": "2016-11-03T09:01:14.062Z"  
    },  
    "status": "DRAFT"  
}

    
    
      
    

  
Each rule group is the first object under 'ruleGroup'. Each rule group array
of object may contain multiple rule objects.  
Here in a rule object,  
\- field_key reflects property name under 'fields' from client setting json.  
\- attribute represents ruleType from client setting json.  
\- ruleType represents the tabName from client setting json.  
\- offerId is used only for attribute offerEvent and stores id of selected
offer  
\- columnName is used only for fileData and stores column name (acctNumber,
acctType etc) it represents index of selected value of values for ruleTupe
fileData  
\- operand stores the values  
\- operator stores the conditionValue
