title: View Client List feature
body: Description:

View Client List is a new feature that is add under client Management feature.
This is a root feature applicable to root users only. Users of the role that
has enabled View Client List can see cids on home page.

  

Back ground:

Reason for developing this feature is to restrict offshore DSI print team
users from viewing client's data on production. We will create a new role for
offshore print DSI team users on production and give them below access. This
will allow them to access client management tab and change message settings
only on production.
