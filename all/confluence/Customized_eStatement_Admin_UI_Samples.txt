title: Customized eStatement Admin UI Samples
body:   1. TKCU: <https://10.8.11.208:11931/msm/login.jsp> (sitescope)
    1. Things to look for:
      1. Banner Mgmt Feature - This will be a standard option for our clients to have. Moving forward any clients can request this option as a standard offering/base installation. Also notice how the banner is visually located in the Admin Site.
      2. Reports AI User Modification Activity - This is an audit report containing the Admin User creation/modification/deletion/update password activity. This was customized into TKCU's setup. I'd like to incorporate this into the new standard offering.
      3. POD Checks - This is a query screen to allow the admin user to search for POD items. This type of POD check is most likely rare for other clients to ask for. For now, this will be only made available to TKCU
      4. Draft Image Search - This is a query screen to allow the admin user to search for normal check items. This is probably going to be made available as a standard. However, we still need to make a few additional improvements in this particular module because we are concerned with the performance of how this feature works.
      5. Administration Edit - We've enhance the Admin User Maintenance module with the following features:
        1. Disable Admin User after 90 days of no activity
        2. Send email notification to Admin user if their password changed.
        3. Allows the Admin User to update his/her email address.

  2. Sunflower bank: <https://10.8.10.209:11321/msm/login.jsp> (sitescope) [NOTE: THIS URL IS DIFFERENT THAN THE OTHER CLIENTS]
    1. Things to look for:
      1. Fax Feature (Optional Item that 2 -3 clients chosen. It is in our standard optional pricing features)
      2. Product Type - This is still under development and will only be made available to SNFB only. This is a custom request to allow the bank to manage the product type description per account type. This is used so that we can pull the product type description and include it into the customer site and the customer email notification.
