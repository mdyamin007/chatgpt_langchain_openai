title: Postage Report issues supported for accounting
body: 1\. Early/Late drop: report goes to early/next month  
2\. PC input a wrong drop date: (say year of 2012) the report will not show.  
3\. Failed status (-1 or 11): currently Peter or Terrance will fix it  
4\. New job setup without creating the entry in job_type table and paper side
need fix it.  
5\. Missing markup rate: moved from MP to TX and the markup rate tie to appid
and datacenter(MP/TX)  
6\. Report was filtered out by a filter list. (Taxes, and some special
clients)  
7\. No billing information for all heavies (over 13OZ?) and no information in
rate_oz table  
8\. Window schedule stop working: no reports generated at all  
9\. For all the issues they fixed if out of 10th - 15th each month, I need
manually kick off the scheduler to re-run the report.
