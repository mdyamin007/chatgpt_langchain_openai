title: ISD Label Guide
body: When creating Confluence pages, the following standard labels should be added
to group pages to aide with document searching.

General Rules:

  1. Labels should always be lowercase.
  2. Multi-worded labels should be dash concatenated, e.g. user-guide.
  3. Labels should be general by topics.
  4. A combination of labels should be used to specificity instead of creating almalgam labels, e.g. a document can have both the hypercube and sso labels instead of a singular hypercube-sso label.
