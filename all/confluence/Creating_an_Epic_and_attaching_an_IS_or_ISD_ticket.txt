Step-by-step guide

  1. Look for the blue **" Create"** button on the top of the page. Click it to get started  
  
  

  2. You'll see a modal popup for you to enter in the details. Make sure the **" Project"** field is correct and the IssueType is set to "Epic"  
  
  

  3. There's a tab for both Print and Electronic details. Information entered here will be carried over when a Print or Electronic ticket is created for this Epic.  

Once created, you'll be taken to the ticket details. If you're having trouble
finding the ticket, check under either "Issues" or "Kanban Board" to find it.

  5. A IS or ISD ticket can be automatically generated and pre-populated with the details on the epic under **Workflow >  "Create IS Ticket" , "Create ISD Ticket." "Sync"** is used to recopy the values over so that all the fields are in sync.
