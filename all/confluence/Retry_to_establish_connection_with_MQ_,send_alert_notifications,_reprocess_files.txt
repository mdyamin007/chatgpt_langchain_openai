title: Retry to establish connection with MQ ,send alert notifications, reprocess files
body: Previously indexfileprocess does not retry to connect with MQ if connection
failed once. Now the application will try to connect twice. When ever the
application faces any issue with MQ connection, it trigger an alert stating
that connection issue.

Moreover, application also trigger some notification about the MQ status like
how many jobs are currently in queued or processing status. We also introduce
another mechanism to reprocess any indexfile.

We have to add the following properties into our application property file.

    
    
    mq.exception.email.from=Trigger Alert - [DEV] <data_center@infoimageinc.com>  
    stack.job.email.from=Trigger Alert - [DEV] <data_center@infoimageinc.com>
    
    
    primary.recipient.mq.exception=anil.dasa@infoimageinc.com
