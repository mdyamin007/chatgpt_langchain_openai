## Goals

  * Create a standardized User Removal process on the PUI.

## Background and strategic fit

This will meets various clients' needs to remove users on a scheduled basis.
Many clients need the ability to remove subusers, because full subuser
information cannot be provided for the Auth file.

## Assumptions

  * Input will be a list of CIF. Either singular CIF (ABC123) or a CIF|subuser (ABC123|userA). 
  * The process will go through the following logic:
    1. Search for the user.
    2. If user is not found, do nothing.
    3. If user is found, then
      1. Delete all ufas
      2. Delete all nps
      3. Delete all nicknames
      4. Deactivate the user
      5. DEPENDENT on subuser logic setup, if the user is a primary user, do (a) to (d) for all subusers also (before deactivating the primary user)
    4. Check all accounts that were unlinked to ensure that they have at least one user enrolled (SSO/DSO date); otherwise the account will be reverted back to Paper.
