## Goals

  * Create a new CID to handle msbk's secure PDF email. 
  * Setup AUTH file processing to ingest emails, account numbers, and secure PDF passwords. Switch accounts to E delivery.
  * Setup Email handler to trigger secure PDF emails for any accounts that contain an email address and are on E delivery.
  * Pull email content from MSBK for MEF statement type
  * Pull statement index file and AFP files from MSBK's input/indiv_afp folder
  * Include email counts into MSBK's accounting report.

## Background and strategic fit

A temporary workaround for MSBK's MEF application. They are requesting to have
secure PDF emails and to not have them be displayed on both AI and Customer
sites. The temporary solution is to setup the application under a separate CID
to minimize potential risks when turning on secure PDF emails. A permanent
reusable solution will need to be discussed between IS and ISD in the future.

## Assumptions

  * ISD will be responsible for converting AFPs to PDFs and password encrypting the file to be attached in the email
  * Converted PDFs over 20 MB will not be attached and no emails will be sent
  * Each account will only have 1 email address
  * Any accounts in the cycle with an email address will have a secure PDF email sent to them
  * No bounceback report needed
  * No eStatement Job Tracking
