title: AUTHENTICATION LAYER- SSO/DSO.
body: 
    There are broadly three ways in which SSO is being handled at Infoimage   
     1) SESSIONID : The client makes a request passing the authentication information(user,acc)in the form of SessionId to   
        Infoimage(host).The host sends back a "return url" just to confirm that the request   
        has been sent by the client itself.After the initial confirmation the host   
        validates the relevant information for the user and the organization and return the SessionId  
        or in some cases "sucess" or "failure" depending upon the result of the validation.  
        ex : GBBK (OSI core).  
     2)HASHING :The client makes a request passing in a hashed string which is a combination of  different authentication   
       parameters like (hash(LoginId+timestamp)).The hashing is mostly done using MD5 algorithm.  
       The host authenticates the client CID and then decrypts and validates the user and sends back the   
       response.  
     3)XML FORMAT :The client passes all the authentication information in xml format as in  
        &lt;accnum="1234" login="loginname"...&gt;.  
       It also passes the user SSN which is used to validate the unique user.  
       All the information is again validated in the usual way sending back the response.
