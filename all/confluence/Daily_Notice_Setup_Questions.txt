title: Daily Notice Setup Questions
body:   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  * Confirm frequency to print and send DN

  

  * Set-up FTP account to receive customer file(s) via FTP with **PGP** encryption
  * Using our FTP or completely different host?
  * If not using our FTP web vault, then obtain credentials for chosen host

  

  * Confirm date file format

Ex : Flat file, XML, PDF, PCL, PI

  

  * Is there going to be single data file or multiple data file used for processing.
  * If multiple, the recommended approach is for the client to zip all the files together prior to sending it over to us.
  * If single, then send the file over with the minimumfile naming convention field requirements InfoIMAGE is requesting.

  

  * Determine file naming convention for inbound and outbound file. Here is a list of the common field names we must have in order to recognize their data file:
  *  **CID** : InfoIMAGE's 4 digit client id (e.g. bfcu - BayFederal Credit Union; ewbb - East West Bank); Our program must have this unique field to help confirm the data file being used corresponds to the program we wrote. It is a preventative measure to not use the program to run another client's data file.
  *  **Cycle** **Date** : We try to encourage the client to use the same cycle date that the statement/notices. However, we do encounter some clients that are unable to use the cycle date associated to the contents of the data file. If that is the case, system date is acceptable. Common date format can be: MMDDYYYY and MMDDYY.
  *  **Segment** **Number** : Segment numbers are used whenever there is multiple files processed in the same day. There will be setups where clients will state that there will rarely or never be another set of files sent in one business day. If that is case, we still want the client to hard the number "1" in the file naming convention. Our programming needs to be flexible to run multiple times a day without overwriting the first segment.

Above are the three minimum data fields requirements needed in the file naming
conventions. Typical delimiter between these fields is "_". In addition to the
three fields, you always need to include a small descriptive fixed application
name that can be anything. e.g. _ewbb_dda_{MMDDYYYY}_{SEG#}.txt.pgp_

  * Email confirmation for file receipt

  * File arrival
  * File missing

  

  * Are there going to be check images printed?

  

  * Refer to check image questionnaire - **TO-DO**

  

  * Is there going to be electronic post ? Archival term?

  

  * Refer to electronic statement questionnaire - **TO-DO**

  

  

  * Design
  * Design template to be provided by CU? Or use existing template and modify as per CU preference?
  * Are there going be multiple cycles processing in a day? Or one cycle per day?
  * Notices printed on one side of a sheet (simplex) or on both sides of a sheet (duplex)
  * FONT: confirm font for headers/headlines and body text
  * Confirm with CU
  *  **Preprint or standard white,** A pre-print contains company's branding/logo in full color and would require pricing pre-defined in your contract and/or addendum agreement with InfoIMAGE (rate per 1K sheets). If a black and white logo on the letter is acceptable, a Pre-print is NOT required. 
  * Notice is multi page 
  * Has tear off section included in notices
  * Does notice require a return envelope
  * Has insert marketing or informational
  * Has disclosure 

  

  * Data
  * Identify major and minor codes for statement printing
  * Identify anchor per customer if multiple notice types in single data file
  * Check scenario if multiple pdf are expected on same day per customer
  * Process other letters like ex: welcome letters or financial notices along with DN?
  *  **Mask/Unmask** account number for print vs electronic. Does client require account numbers masked in the document? If yes, the data file must be sent to us without masking in order for us to provide account number indexing information for PDF archival and/or eStatements
  * Determine the unique field to retrieve data from multiple data sets per statement. For Ex: If statement data is retrieved from multiple data sets based on unique field either applicant ID or applicant name or both.

  

  

  * InfoTRAC Portal
  * Online Proofing
  * Mail tracking
  * InfoDoc reports, insert, account management

  

  * Suppression
  *  **Invalid Address:** Do we print and mail first class and have the USPS return any that they can't deliver via their normal postal channel, or do we suppress those invalid addresses from print and provide a report to the CU.  If we provide  a report it will post to InfoImage's ftp site in the client pick up folder.  CU to provide email addresses of who needs to be alerted when it posts.  Email aliases work best for this in case someone is out of the office or changes positions
  *  **Custom handling:** Any special handling in case of unknown product types
  * Reports

  

  *  **Invalid address** : Suppress and provide a report back in the FTP client pick up folder. Confirm file naming convention for report.

Ex:  CID_[app]_invalid_mail_address_<mmddyyyy>_<Seg#>.csv.pgp

  *  **Unknown product types** : Suppress and provide a report back in the FTP client pick up folder. Confirm file naming convention for report. TBD by CU?

  

  

  * PDF archival to DVD or PDF
  * In case of multiple DN, confirm archival retention period be different for each DN or same for entire application?
  * Confirm with CU
  * Zip filename

               Ex:  CID_<loannotice>_<yyyymmdd>_seq.zip 

  * Password protected
  * pdf files and an index file. Each zip file will contain 200 pdfs and associated one index file
  * Index files

Ex: CID_<loannotice>_<date/printDate>_<seq>.xml

  * Pdf name

Ex: <loannotice>_<date/printDate> _<account no>_<seq>.pdf

  * Index contents in xml format 
  * Refer PDF archival smartsheet for checklist and questions to CU

 **BA - Notes: **

  1. Checkif there is a pre process
  2. Key data fields we need to capture across all data file formats

  * Account Number (w/o Leading zeros)
  * Address Lines
  * Statement / Notice Date (used primary for eStatements, but should be mapped out regardless if they have eStatements or not)
  * Need to capture the Begin Date and the Closing Date. If begin date is not available, then use the same value as the closing date.
  * App Code (used primary for InfoIMAGE's eStatement solution); Generally Credit Union systems like Jack Henry Symi
  * Because the Account Number may overlap between application types, it is critical that we need to have different application types such as DDA, SAV, Loans, CD, Safe Deposit Box, etc .
