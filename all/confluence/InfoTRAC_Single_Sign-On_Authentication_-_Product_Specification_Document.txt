#### What is Single Sign-On Authentication?

|

#### Product Overview

Single Sign-On feature will allow employees from customer side to login to
Infotrac application with out using direct login page. Employees from client
organization can use their own client specific login id and password for
login. Single Sign-On set up can be set up for clients who are using Microsoft
Active Directory Federation Services(ADFS) for users management. ADFS provide
services to communicate between two different servers. We can establish
communication between InfoImage ADFS and client ADFS by exchanging certain
authentication information. From Infoimage side, there is a product developed
(InfoAuth) to establish communication between InfoImage ADFS and many customer
ADFS servers. Each customer has specific url with key and token specific to
customer.

  

  

 _ **Communication Steps :**_

1\. External application initiates an SSO call through InfoAuth service. (1)  
2\. InfoAuth looks for existing login sessions of the user. (2) If user is
logged in, then the user gets logged  
into the InfoIMAGE application (InfoTRAC). (3)  
3\. If no user session is present, then an SSO call gets initiated to the
internal ADFS server. (4)  
4\. Internal ADFS communicates with InfoAuth and gets External ADFS domain.
(5,6)  
5\. Internal ADFS redirects the user to external ADFS domain and lets the user
login; if logged in then return  
back to InfoIMAGE ADFS with tokens with required claims. (7,8)  
6\. Internal ADFS then redirects the user to the InfoAuth and through
InfoAuth, the user gets redirected to  
the preferred application (InfoTRAC).

  

#### Features Included

  * Seamless authentication to Infotrac without any need for additional dedicated credentials for Infotrac.
  * Multiple services and product authentication capability with a single authentication credential.
  * Automatic user account creation.
  * Users will be able to sign into the clients' preferred login portal.

  
  
  
#### Where does the Single Sign-On Authentication fit?

|

#### Client's Fit

The Single Sign-On feature enables clients to regulate user authentication. It
eliminates the inconvenience of creating multiple accounts and accessing them
in multiple services including Infotrac. Users can only sign onto the client's
login portal while the client's system controls the authorization of the
user's access request. The Single Sign-On feature simply relies on the
client's authorization and automatically handles account creation and secure
authentication.

####  InfoIMAGE's Fit

The Single Sign-On feature brings simplicity while keeping the authentication
procedure secured. It provides the client the control they need for
authorizing the user and their access to Infotrac and any services. As the
authentication procedure is managed centrally, a single set of credentials is
sufficient for multiple services/products. It makes the whole authentication
procedure faster and easier.

# Common Questions Around Product  
  
---  
Question| Outcome  
How will a user authenticate through the SSO?| We can generate a URL for this
feature while configuring. Clients shall use provided URL to their users to
access the authentication user interface and users should be able to sign in
to the application with their credentials.  
How will a user have their authentication credentials?| Users will have their
credentials from their respective clients. Clients shall create user
profiles/accounts in the authentication system for their users.  
Does a client have to configure anything to enable this feature?| Clients will
have to configure a relying party trust using a metadata file provided by the
InfoIMAGE.  
What will happen if a set of credentials does not belong to an existing user
account on Infotrac side?| A new account shall be automatically created during
the sign-in period.  
Do users have to use the same credentials for both DSO and SSO-based
authentication?| Credentials do not have to be the same for both the DSO and
SSO-based authentication. Users' SSO authentication requests are authorized
and validated by the clients' system, the target application will accept or
reject the request depending on this authorization and validation. Whereas DSO
authentication is handled by the application itself, therefore both
credentials can be different or the same. So SSO username/password
combination(not stored on our side) and DSO username/password can be same or
different.  
What does a client need to provide to enable this feature?| Clients will have
to provide their federation metadata file generated by their authentication
service (Microsoft Active Directory Federation Service).  
Can authentication credentials be changed for the SSO feature?| If the client
allows their users to change credentials in their central authentication
service (e.g. Microsoft Active Directory Federation Service), users should be
able to change it.  
What roles are assigned for a user created via SSO?| All users created for
Infotrac via sso login will be assigned to a particular role. We can work with
customer to decide what permission should be given to this role. Once User is
created, admin user from client side and assign this new user to a different
role.  
Does SSO login work from all locations?| No. SSO login for Infotrac will work
only from clients whitelisted IP addresses.  
Can a particular client have both SSO and DSO login?| Yes.
