on 1/11/2013, We had the initial meeting. Please check the attachment for
first version of the design and what has been discussed during the meeting and
the to do list before next meeting.

How to get Information for eStmt tracking purpose

    1. What we discussed:
      1. Briefly discuss dt_job_id and afp index file information will be saved in IS database. During estmt processing, we can carry the dt_job_id information to eStmt side.
      1. However, for clients with eStmt only, there is no record in process_main table, some information we may not able to get, for example file arrive information, # of files and etc information.
      1. Peter proposed to record eStmt processing information in process_main also, add a "type" column to indicate "paper" or "estmt" processing.
      1. Paper side need evaluate how many program needs to be touched to add "type" as a filter
      2. eStmt processing need capture the information.
      1. Terrence proposed to create a new table for eStmt only and record whatever information eStmt job tracking needs to display.
        1. Only eStmt processing logic will be touched.
        2. InfoTrac need query both tables and "union" them by dt_job_id (with good status)

For either of the above 2 proposed approaches, paper side currently has no
resource to work on this project.

To do:

      1. After discuss with Ben and Lin, based on next week's design meeting, depends on the requirement forinfoTrac interface, we will come back and revisit the above logic.
  3. [eStmt Job Tracking discussion on 1/16 -- Design scope](https://i3dev.easyredmine.com/projects/infotrac/wiki/0116_estmtTracking_meeting)

Design Scope Update

    1. After discussed with Peter and Lin, currently eStmt job tracking had the following blocks:

      1. dt_job_id works for those manual jobs such as Monthly statements, however for other automation jobs, on paper side, dt_job_id was auto-generated, which may out-synced with PC database. Although DP may manually scan to fix the dt_job_id on paper side for paper statement, the link between paper and eStmt will stay broken.
      1. Although eStmt index file and etc were generated from paper side system, currently paper side doesn't have any entry regarding this process. For example, file arrival dates, # of files processed and etc.
      1. Current job tracking are based on dt_job_id to link paper and PC (production) database.

Based on the above blocks, which may take at least 2 months for paper side to
add the logic to link/record paper and eStmt processing, we will narrow down
the scope of the project as the following for phase 1 development:

      1. Support manual job processing (which need DP to manually put dt_job_id in the ins file)
      2. Support job types that have both paper and eStmt processing:
        1. eStmt processing can refer paper processing to get file arrival dates, # of files processed and etc. information. For the clients which have different logic such as MWCU (partial eStmt), we will phase to future phase after paper side start tracking eStmt processing.
  4. [eStmt Job Tracking discussion on 1/18 -- Review with eStmt group](https://i3dev.easyredmine.com/projects/infotrac/wiki/0118_estmtTracking_meeting)
    1. Discussion with eStmt group[](https://i3dev.easyredmine.com/projects/infotrac/wiki/0118_estmtTracking_meeting#Discussion-with-eStmt-group)
    2. We discussed with Will and David regarding information can be provided from eStmt processing:

      1. we currently have the following information available:
        1. Total image counts(posted) (Total failed image counts was not recorded currently)
        2. Total document posted, Total failed
        3. Schedule drop date
        4. Stmt post completion date (Note: different client may request different implementation)
        5. Total good emails, bad emails, malformed emails
        6. non-eSup
      1. Number of insert posted (unique copy of the PDF vs total # of links to PDF)
      1. Total number of check posted

According the meeting, the number of check posted will not be in the first
phase design scope, and # of inserts we will keep both # of unique PDF and
total # of links for selective insert project.
