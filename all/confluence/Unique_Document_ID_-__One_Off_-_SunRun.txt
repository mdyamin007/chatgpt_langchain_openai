## Goals

  * Create a new way that this client or clients are able to pull specific documents based on a Unique ID that they provide. 
  * SunRun wants to retrieve documents for their portal through our InfoService API using a unique Document ID that is set on each records in their data files.

## Background and strategic fit

Sun Run is a new client in a different industry than our customer  

The Executive Members will need to decide if we are pursuing multiple clients
that will have this request in the future, and the value that this would bring
from other customers of the same nature.

## Assumptions

  * Using InfoService API
  * Unique Document ID
  * Query Account by
    * Date
    * Application Code
  * Resides in Data File that is sent over
  * Would ESD-ID be something that would suffice for them?
  * ID Number, Account Number, and Statement Date - can all be verified
  * Both Alpha-Numerical plus symbol
  * InfoTRAC Admin portal we don't need to support - search by invoice number

## Requirements

#| Title| User Story| Importance| Notes  
---|---|---|---|---  
1| Unique ID request| The requirement is to use the account number as the
identifier and store a unique ID for every document| Service Killer|

  * During the processing we need to store the unique ID, this only applies to API, so when they make a call they search by the document ID
