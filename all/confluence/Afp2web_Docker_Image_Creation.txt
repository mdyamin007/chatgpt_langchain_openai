Installation Notes

Download and install the I3_20200415_a2ws_update.tgz full release and Install
it into /var/lib/apache2/fcgid/a2wserver as described below:

1\. Stop Apache Server  
service apache2 stop

2\. Unzip the update package into AFP2web Server's installation directory  
tar xvzf I3_20200415_a2ws_update.tgz -C /var/lib/apache2/fcgid/a2wserver

3\. Change ownership and permission of the unzipped files  
cd /var/lib/apache2/fcgid/a2wserver  
chown -R www-data:www-data *  
chmod 644 a2w/core/dm/*.pm a2w/core/visitor/*.pm

4\. Start Apache server  
service apache2 start

  

As we're building the docker image, we have to focus on step 2 there, where
the tar.gz file has been extracted into /var/lib/apache2/fcgid/a2wserver

For docker build we don't have to use **tar**  for doing that, we can simply
use **ADD  **in Dockerfile

  

  

Step 3 is for the permission and ownership change so that Apache can read all
the configuration files. Inside **Dockerfile  **the ownership for the files
are already there. so you don't have to do anything unless new type of files
are being introduced.
