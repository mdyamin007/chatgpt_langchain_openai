# Glossary

  1. eStatement Site: This is the web application hosted by InfoIMAGE where Users will log in to access their accounts and statements.
  2. Financial Institution (FI/Client): The financial institution serviced by InfoIMAGE. 
  3. User: This is the end user, who is a customer of the financial institution.

# Access Security

Access to the InfoIMAGE Hypercube eStatement Site follows the OAuth framework.

## Direct Sign-On

### User Authentication

#### Login and Password

A User must provide a valid Login and Password in order to access the
eStatement Site.

To Signup, the User must provide the following:

  1. One account number that the User owns.
  2. The User's SSN/TIN.
  3. A string of letters that match a Security Code Captcha that is displayed during the Signup process.

#### Multifactor Authentication

The Client can opt-in to require Multifactor Authentication for the User.
After the User has successfully logged in, the User will be required to input
a MFA token sent to the User via email, or sms (if sms is opted-in by the
Client).

The timeout for the MFA token by default is 10 minutes, but the Client can
determine what this value can be. Due note that the default timeout of the
eStatement site is also 10 minutes.

#### Login Recovery

To recovery the Login, the User must provide the following:

  1. One account number that the User owns.
  2. The User's SSN/TIN.

#### Password Recovery

To recovery the Password, the User must provide the following:

  1. One account number that the User owns.
  2. The User's SSN/TIN.
  3. If  **Multifactor Authentication** is active, the User must provide the MFA token sent as part of this Password Recovery code.
  4. If  **Multifactor Authentication** is not active, then the User must provide the Security Question and Answer the User inputted during Signup.

### Account Ownership Scope

The scope of account ownership is determined by an Authorization File. This is
a file that is provided by the Client to InfoIMAGE that defines valid Users,
represented by CIFs, and the Accounts that the Users have access to. The CIFs
may not directly correlate to a financial institution's CIF. Typical values
are SSN/TIN, Member/Org Number, or a unique alphanumeric value determined by
the FI.

#### Authorization File

The authorization file is provided to InfoIMAGE via secure FTP. Though not a
requirement, InfoIMAGE always recommend the file be provided PGP encrypted.
