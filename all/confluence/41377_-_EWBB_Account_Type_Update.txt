## Goals

  * Add in Account Type as an additional identifier for a unique account. Bank sends account type information via CIF file and API.
  * Group statements from similar account types under the same account, and also restrict some account types as its own type separately.
  * Have the flexibility to allow for Account Type descriptions to show on the site and be updated as needed. In customer site, the type description is under Profile at the account level.

## Background and strategic fit

Allow the bank to define unique account records with account number and
product type.

## Assumptions

  * Allow the bank to define unique account records with account number and product type.
  * When account type is updated within a pre-determined product group, don't restrict account type code (allow it to be interchangeable).
  * For account types that is not included in the group, do not commingle statement and do not update account type and type description with new input data.
  * Same structure for multiple application type: Deposit statements / HK statements / Loan Statement etc.
  * We will use fin_account.type to be the internal account type, and fin_account.sub_type to be the changing external type. 
  * Each acct_number/type pair is unique (existing database constraint/global business rule).
