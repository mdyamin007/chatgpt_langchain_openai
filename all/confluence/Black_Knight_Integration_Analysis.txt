Develop 3 API endpoint to allow BKI to retrieve documents

  * Health Check 
  * Document Listing 
  * Document Read

| Must Have|  
  
2| API will be based on Loan Number|  
| See attached specification from Onbase.  
3| Document will be in PDF format|  
|  
  
4| API must respond in 20 seconds|  
|  
  
5| API must support basic authentication|  
|  
  
  
# Base Requirements

ID| Name| Description  
---|---|---  
R-001| Portfolio Mapping|

There will be some way to map a portfolioIdentifier to a CID.

 **TDB**

  1. Spring config?
  2. New DB table? Oracle? Mongo?

  
R-002| Statement Type Mapping|

"Hardcoded" mapping from:

  * loan -> LoanStatement
  * escrow -> EscrowStatement
  * etax -> TaxStatement
  * enotices and other applicable statements -> Other

  
R-003| PDF Presentment Only| Skip documents that do not have PDF presentment
type.  
R-004| Return All Documents Within Archival| Archival period defined in
properties will define the range of documents to return. The API will not
accept a date range.  
R-005| Document Description| Document Description/Name can be pulled from the
doc_desc table.  
R-006| BASIC Authentication| Allow for BASIC Authentication that will only use
a username and password. No encryption logic like currently is being used.  
  
Notes:

  1. Account Numbers won't be encrypted

## Things to think about

ID| Name| Description  
---|---|---  
O-001| Enforce Account Type and Statements|

Require that for Black Knight integration, the statements have to be posted to
a specific account type (BK or something).

Require that the only statements posted to the account is loan, escrow, etax,
and loan-relevant accounts.

This means that for existing setup, there might need to be a document
migration necessary for existing accounts. And the client also have to start
using Account Types if they haven't already.  
  
O-002| Account Number Mapping|

If we do not do O-001, we have to be able to support mapping from the numbers
that Black Knight send to a values that we are using for the client on our
side.

For example: Loan Number -> Member Number

This reverse mapping has one downside is that if a Member Number owns multiple
loans, then for any Loan Number, ALL loan statements must be returned. **There
is no way to distinguish which statements below to which loan numbe** **r**.  
  
O-003| Loan Number in LOAN_ID| Print team will provide the Loan Number in the
LOAN_ID, so that they can be inserted in the estmt_doc table for querying the
Loan Numbers.  
  
# Integration/Requirement with Other Services

## Document Processing

ID| Name| Description  
---|---|---  
D-001| Document Preconversion|

Pre-Convert all documents to PDF to avoid conversion time during API call.  
  
## Email Notification

ID| Name| Description  
---|---|---  
E-001| Enrollment File|

Client will need to provide InfoIMAGE with an Enrollment File to update the
account's delivery preference and notification values.  
  
E-002| Sending Emails| Emails will be sent out with the normal Email Service
based on the delivery preference provided by the Enrollment File.  
E-003| Email Sent Time| The email jobs can be automated at 5pm, and then 10pm
for jobs processed after 5pm. 11:30am is a time that can be supported, but
have to be opted in.

# Document API Design

Doc List API

  1. .../v1/loans/[portfolioIdentifier]/[Account Number]/docs
  2. Query will order by esd_closingdate/etax_stamp DESC; or the object has to be sorted after query.
  3. Combine both statements and taxes (and enotices as Other for Black Knight?)
  4.   

{

  "Documents": [

    {

      "DocumentCreationDate": "2018-06-01",

      "DocumentIdentifier": "string",

      "DocumentMimeType": "application/pdf",

      "DocumentName": "string",

      "DocumentCategoryType": "LoanStatement",

      "DocumentType": "1098"

    }

  ]

}  
  
---  
  
  

## Doc Read API

  1. .../v1/loans/[portfolioIdentifier]/[Account Number]/docs/[esd_id] call WrapperService to return PDF stream.
  2.   

{

  "DocumentContent": "base64-encoded string",

  "DocumentMimeType": "application/pdf",

  "DocumentName": "string"

}  
  
---  
  
  

## Health Check API

  1. New healthcheck Endpoint using the same code as existing heartbeat.

## Doc Upload API

  1. Do not need to implement at this time.

  

  

  

# Effort and Timeline

Task| Effort (Hours)| Start Date| Target Date| Description  
---|---|---|---|---  
BASIC Authentication| 5| 2/14| 2/21| Authenticate only with username and
password  
Health Check API Pilot| 1| 2/14| 2/21| Healthcheck should be available on
Pilot for Black Knight to test along with the BASIC Authentication.  
Mapping Configuration| 1| 2/21| 2/28|  
  
Doc List API Pilot| 18| 2/21| 2/28| To get some ready, the Account Mapping
won't be developed during this task.  
Doc Read API Pilot| 18| 2/28| 3/7|  
  
Doc List API - Account Mapping support|  
|  
|  
| May not be needed if LOAN_ID can be used in the Document index file.  
Setting up the dedicated Production APIPUI/Wrapper clusters| 5| TBD| TBD|  
  
Release|  
| 6/13| 6/20| Release early, so that maybe Black Knight can do manual testing
to make sure everything's good on Production.  
Live Date| N/A|  
| 6/25| This is when Black Knight release their code to Production.

# Questions

  1. Does BKI support account type or has overlapping account number for each applications that may belong to different customer?
  2. Since the API specification does not provide the authentication and respond format, please see the InfoIMAGE's documentation for the [API respond specification](https://confluence.infoimageinc.com/download/attachments/86934270/Black%20Knight%20Integration.docx?version=1&modificationDate=1643395666207&api=v2) and [Authentication](https://confluence.infoimageinc.com/download/attachments/114001719/InfoIMAGE%20Service%20API%20-%20Auth%20Info%20-%20SNFB.docx?version=1&modificationDate=1643391231387&api=v2).
  3. The document (page 2) said that BKI has the ability for customer to enroll into electronic delivery preference, can BKI provide InfoIMAGE a daily report indicating which customer enrolled and which account are on electronic delivery preference?
  4. If InfoIMAGE has additional document type beside Loan, Escrow, and eTax, does InfoIMAGE need to group them into the 'other' application in the respond?
  5. What is the frequency will Black Knight send a request to the Health Check API?
  6. Are the account number be transferred in plain text?  Does BKI support any encryption algorithm?
  7. It was mentioned that the document list API is called for each statement type. How is the statement type differentiated? Is it through the .../loans/...? So for escrow it would be .../escrows/... ? What are all the values?
