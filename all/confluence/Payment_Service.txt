Notes from 19-Jan Meeting  
\---------------------------  
1\. EPAY_TRANSACTION table will hold all EPX call does not matter it is for
Validation or BRIC creation or Payment. There will be one Column CALL_BY in
Table which will hold one of these value.  
2\. In case Multiple Wrong Entered Values , for Example Chose wrong card type
and incorrect Zip code. Can we show all failed Validation in one Message? As
of now we only show based upon which validation fails first.
