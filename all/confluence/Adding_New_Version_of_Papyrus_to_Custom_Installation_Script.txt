title: Adding New Version of Papyrus to Custom Installation Script
body: The following how-to article describes the process of updating our custom
windows bat setup script to add newer versions of Papyrus Desktop Software
Suite.  Use this guide if you are setting up a newer version of Papyrus for
the very first time.  The follow guide will require you to install the
software first locally on your machine first.  Then the instructions will ask

other developers can use without having to go through standard Papyrus
Installation software.
