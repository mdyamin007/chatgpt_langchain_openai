title: Auth File Specifications Document
body: # Overview

* * *

INLINE

The primary purpose of the CIF file is to establish user-account relationships
defining for InfoIMAGE who are the users and what accounts they have access
to. Each record in the file can be understood as User, identified by the UUID,
will have access to Account, identified by the account number and, if
applicable, account type.

  

 **Command**|  auth, auth2  
---|---  
 **Frequency**|  Daily  
 **Completeness**|  Incremental, or Full. When using a Full file, it is
important to assess all areas where user-account relationships are created,
and ensure that the Auth File does not purge incorrectly. New processes that
affect user-account relationships will also need to take the Auth File into
consideration.

# Content Specifications

* * *

Fields are delimited by pipe ( | ). Core fields are always required. For each
additional processing module needed, the columns defined under the module
section will need to be included. Follow the required column to determine
which column is necessary depending on setup. Note that once a column has been
included, and it is denoted as  **Required** , an empty field in the record
will most likely result in an error.

## Core Fields

Field

Number

Field Name

| Required| Type|  **Contraint**|

Description  
  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
1| UNIQUE  USER IDENTIFIER (UUID)| Y| ALPHANUMERIC| 100 max length| The user
identifier. Typically the SSN/TIN, CIF, or a Unique Identifier from the Online
Banking Vendor.  
2| USER TYPE| Y| DEFINED VALUES| 1 max length| P/N, P = Consumer user, N =

4| ACCOUNT NUMBER| Y| NUMERIC| 100 max length|

The account number.  
  
5| ACCOUNT TYPE| N| DEFINED VALUES (ALPHANUMERIC)| 1-2 length|

The account type. Values are defined by the client and InfoIMAGE, and must be
consistent among all files, and the SSO request (if applicable). If values
cannot be consistent, mapping(s) must be provided to InfoIMAGE so that
InfoIMAGE can map all external values to internal values to maintain
consistency.

Not applicable for setups without account types.  
  
6| ACCOUNT NAME| Y| ALPHANUMERIC| 100 max length|

The full name of the account.

 **Business**

UUID|USER TYPE|USER NAME|ACCOUNT NUMBER|ACCOUNT TYPE|ACCOUNT NAME

455555000|N|BUSINESS LLC|888888888|LN|BUSINESS LLC

## Incremental File

When the client wants to send only the updates, and not the full file every
time, then a maintenance code is needed to let InfoIMAGE know what action to
take. It is recommended that the maintenance code be the first column in the
file, so the operation is easily identifiable.

Field

Number

|

Field Name

| Required| Type|  **Contraint**|

Description  
  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
1| MAINTENANCE CODE| Y| DEFINED VALUES| 1 length|  **A** = Add or update the
user-account relationship, and other related information.  
 **D** = Delete the user-account relationship and related information. If
after the action, the user no longer has access to any other accounts, the
user will also be deactivated.  
  
  

Examples

MAINTCODE|UUID|USER TYPE|USER NAME|ACCOUNT NUMBER|ACCOUNT TYPE|ACCOUNT NAME

A|123456789|P|John Doe|654321789|DD|John Doe

D|123456789|P|John Doe|765432189|SV|Jane Doe

## Business SSO Sub-User

If the client and/or the OLB vendor can provide the subuser information, an
additional column will need to be included. It is recommended that the SUID
column follows the UUID, so the full ID can be easily determined.

Field

Number

|

Field Name

| Required| Type|  **Contraint**|

Description  
  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
1| SUBUSER UNIQUE IDENTIFIER (SUID)| Y, for Sub-Users. If left empty, the user
is assumed to be a Primary User.| ALPHANUMERIC| UUID length + SUID length + 1
<= 100| The unique identifier for the Sub-User. This only needs to be unique
within the business. For example, given that there are two Businesses with
UUID ABC and DEF, the SUID ADMIN can exists for both business: ABC|ADMIN and
DEF|ADMIN. Within the ABC UUID, of course, ADMIN cannot exist twice for two
different users.  
  
This value can be arbitrarily defined by the client or the Online Banking
Vendor.  
  
  

Examples

UUID|SUID|USER TYPE|USER NAME|ACCOUNT NUMBER|ACCOUNT TYPE|ACCOUNT NAME

455555000|ADMIN|N|John Doe|888888888|LN|BUSINESS LLC

455555000|ADMIN|N|John Doe|777777777|LN|BUSINESS INC

455555000|NJOHNSON|N|Nick Johnson|777777777|LN|BUSINESS INC

  

The above example define a business that have two accounts 777777777 and
888888888. The business belongs to John Doe, so he has access to all accounts.
John Doe determine that his employee Nick should only have access to 777777777
but not 888888888.

necessary.
