title: How to Install Papyrus Software Suite
body: **_Papyrus module installation_**

  

  1. Install the base scripts. This only need to be done **_once_**.

\\\dell-2100\is\papyrus_version_install\papyrus_base_install.bat

           

  1. Install a papyrus version. The script will allow you to select which available version to install.

\\\dell-2100\is\papyrus_version_install\papyrus_version_install.bat

  

  

 _Note:_

  *  _Step 1:_

 _Make sure that your system  environment variable is setup correctly to point
to the correct IPAS Server._

 _Open the System Properties:_

 __

 _Click on the "Environment Variables..." button:_

 __

  

 _Make sure the following 4  variables are defined and created:_

 _ISIS_COMMON:  c:\isiscomm_

 _ISIS_KEY_MODE:  ALL_

 _ISIS_OMS_DOMAIN:  ca-ipas-pr-02.infoimageinc.com  (Note:  This is the ipas
server URL.)_

 _ISIS_OMS_PORT:  9091_

  

 _Please also confirm that you PC can communicate to the IPAS_OMS_DOMAIN
server.  If not, you will need to reach out to Network Department to give
firewall permissions to communicate to the server on port 9091_

 _Assuming you have the "telnet" utility installed on your PC, open the
command prompt window and enter telnet ca-ipas-pr-02.infoimageinc.com_

 __

  

It responds with a blank page like below, then you are fine.  If not, please
share the error message to Network department so that they can see you do not
have permission to communicate to this server on port 9091

  

  

  *  _Step 2 needs to be done once only unless they are updates for the base scripts. It creates the c:\papyrus_start folder on your machine.  It contains the scripts necessary to run the Papyrus modules.   A desktop shortcut will also be created with the name "papyrus_start";  (if not, go to c:\papyrus_start folder).   It will start a menu for you to select which papyrus module to run when doubled clicked.  See below:_

 __

  

  *  _Run step 3 to install each papyrus version. It will create isis_$version and isiscomm_$version on the c drive of your machine where $version is 717, 719, etc.  If you already have those folders, you can rename the original ones before installing._
  *  _\\\dell-2100\is\isis_ _should be mounted as the T drive for the fonts to work properly. lbp is set up to point to the Papyrus font folders there first before your local Papyrus font folders._
  *  _The .prf profiles and default.lbp in userisis of each isis_$version folder have been edited for the Papyrus modules to run properly. They are set up to look for resources such as pseg, overlay, dfa, etc in the c:\isis folder, so do not store resources in the isis_$version folders as they won't be referenced._
  *  _You can install multiple Papyrus Designer modules. For other modules such as AFP designer, Papyrus client, etc, they will always use the latest version.  You will have to install the latest papyrus version before they can be used.  It is version 7.61 at the time this documentation is set up_
  *  _The Papyrus version files are very big and it will take hours if installed remotely through vpn. It is best to be in the office to do the installation through the network._
