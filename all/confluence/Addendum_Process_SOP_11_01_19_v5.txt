AM's should engage with Solutions Engineer (Shailendra), IS/ISD managers and/or other internal staff to complete discovery process. It is recommended that AM's use the ticketing system to document discovery process, upload addendum for client review and approval and initiate a programming request (PR).
  2.  **Discovery -** During the discovery process, AM should compile all the necessary information and follow up with both client and internal staff to clarify any ambiguities before initiating a PR, especially
