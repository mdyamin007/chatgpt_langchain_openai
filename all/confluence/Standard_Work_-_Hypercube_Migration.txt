# Product Increment Suggestion

For clients that require one or more of the situational work, it may be better
to work on the situational work before starting the migration. For example, if
there are FTP reports that do not draw data from the tables that would be
altered by the migration, it is possible to set those up before starting the
migration. Or, it may be better to simply move a client to use Notification
Preference first.
