## **_Notes_**

  * As for now, there is no backend process set up yet, we are using dummy data to test the UI. 
  * If login with new accounts, the paperless status of these new accounts must be E. As there is no enrollment in SSO, **we have to change the paperless2 table manually**. Otherwise, It won't be shown on the profile page. As users are not permitted to change the delivery preference, currently we're hiding this section from the profile page. So, only the email address will be shown with each account. And this will only be visible if the account is on paperless(E).
  * Currently, SSO users can't login via DSO. It Can be changed later.
  * In Dso, 5 failed attempt made within 30 minutes locks the user out for 30 mins. But there is no support in hypercube to reset the counter after 30 minutes. User still remains lockout after 30 minutes. 
  * For now, we are updating email via SSO.
  * DOB is currently configured as a mandatory field
