  1. Strategy for Logic
    * INIT (Pass 0) - parse index file, create message area hashmap of index file records
    * TEST CASE GENERATION (Pass 1) - generate consolidated test cases per msg area
    * MSG ID GENERATION (Pass 2) - evaluate msg id per msg area using priority, and default values. Output to JSON.
  2. Discussion points for Design revision
    * Memory and Performance
      * The whole test case matrix must not be loaded in memory since the total size can end up to be very high.
      * Output to JSON must be done immediately after one row of matrix is evaluated
    * Class design
      * Records must be accessed and evaluated per msg area. Suggestion - HashMap at IndexFile level using msg area as the key
    * Test Case Generation
      * Generate test cases per msg area after consolidation of all criteria within it.  
During consolidation, consider anchor points, especially for criteria which
are value-based, repeat within the msg area and have ranges.  
No evaluation need be done till all criteria per msg area are consolidated  
E.g. for ranges b-d, f-h, the test cases must be a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i  
This will ensure test cases for all priorities.

      * File level test cases must include - first value from file, last value from file, one random value from file, one non-match value
    * Msg ID generation
      * Per msg area only
      * Evaluate test cases against record criteria, using Compound operator of the record
      * Apply priority and default after this
