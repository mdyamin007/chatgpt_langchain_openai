## Goals

  * Be able to process a corrected eTax document
  * Replacement document(s) should hide original but not delete
  * Create a new flag to identify original vs replacement eTax doc

## Background and strategic fit

  

## Assumptions

  * Clients using both eServices & Print should be able to utilize enhancement
  * Clients using only eServices will still have to use pilot work-around
  * Print-only clients will have no net benefit from enhancement

## Requirements

  
| Title| User Story| Importance| Notes|  **Pilot**|  Production  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
1| DB|

Add **is_Correction** column to  **etax** table to identify a replacement eTax
file

INS_PROC & UPDATE_SQL

Value: Y, N, or null (CHAR1)

2| PUI|

  1. Introduce a flag that will be enabled for IDCU to bypass the standard replacement logic, so that old statements will not be hidden from view.
  2. Add a data flag, IS_CORRECTION, and for correction etax processing, all statements will be posted with the flag set to 'Y'.
