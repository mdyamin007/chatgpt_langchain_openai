title: Upgrading Elasticsearch
body: Before upgrading Elasticsearch:

Consult the breaking changes docs.  
Test upgrades in a dev environment before upgrading your production cluster.  
Always back up your data before upgrading. You cannot roll back to an earlier
version unless you have a backup of your data.  
If you are using custom plugins, check that a compatible version is available.  
Elasticsearch can usually be upgraded using a rolling upgrade process,
resulting in no interruption of service. This section details how to perform
both rolling upgrades and upgrades with full cluster restarts.

To determine whether a rolling upgrade is supported for your release, please
consult this table:
