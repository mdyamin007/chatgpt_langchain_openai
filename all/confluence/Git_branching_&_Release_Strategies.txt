Our git migration strategy should be divided into two parts

  1.  **Collaboration** : How each developers code will be managed while working on different features also while working on the same feature development or bug fix
  2.  **Release Management:** This is how a feature will be released into the production this includes individual development, moving upwards to pilot to stage to final release to production.
