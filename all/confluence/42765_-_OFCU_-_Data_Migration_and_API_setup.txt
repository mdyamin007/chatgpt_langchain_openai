## Goals

  * Migrate OFCU's data from contact info to notification preference for the database and back-end processing.

## Background and strategic fit

We are migrating the data such that the client can use API calls on their end.

## Assumptions

  * The client data is currently on contact_info table in the database. 

## Requirements

data to be the same as the previous iteration.| Must Have|

  * Run script to change from CI to NP

  
2| Run emails through API on PUI side| As a user, I want the emails to be the
same as the previous iteration.| Must Have|

  * Change all email handlers to notifyPrefEmailHandler after migration
  * Add passphrase in notifyservice on api level "/usr/local/tomcat/app-configs/notifyservice"

to be accessible as the previous iteration| Must Have|

  * AFP processing

  
  
## User interaction and design

Since this is to move the client off SSO, we are setting up admin site on
infotrac from their prism admin site.
