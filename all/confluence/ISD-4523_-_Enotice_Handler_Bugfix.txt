Description of Work:

  * BBBB eNotice Handler properly group by email address; instead of grouping all users together by account (only 1 user would receive the email in this case!)
  * BBBB eNotice Handler also properly concatenate account numbers, so that a specific email address with multiple account numbers will see all account numbers listed out.
