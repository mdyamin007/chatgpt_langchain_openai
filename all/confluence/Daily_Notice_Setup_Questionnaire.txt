title: Daily Notice Setup Questionnaire
body: What is the frequency of daily notice print and post

Set-up FTP account to receive customer file(s) via FTP with **PGP** encryption

  * Using InfoImage FTP or completely different host?
  * If not using InfoImgae FTP web vault, then obtain credentials for chosen host

What is data file format Ex : Flat file, XML, PDF, PCL, PI

Is there going to be single data file or multiple data file used for
processing.

  * The recommended approach in case of multiple data file is for the client to zip all the files together prior to sending it over to us.
  * In case of single data file, send the file over with the minimum file naming convention field requirements InfoIMAGE is requesting.

Are there going to be check images printed? Refer to check image questionnaire
- **TO-DO**

Is there going to be electronic post ? if so, determine the archival term?
Refer to electronic statement questionnaire - **TO-DO**

 **Daily Notice Design**

  1. Design template to be provided by CU? Or use existing template and modify as per CU preference?
  2. Are there going be multiple cycles processing in a day? Or one cycle per day?
  3. Notices printed on one side of a sheet (simplex) or on both sides of a sheet (duplex)
  4. What is preferred font for headers/headlines and body text
  5.  **Preprint or standard white,** A pre-print contains company's branding/logo in full color and would require pricing pre-defined in your contract and/or addendum agreement with InfoIMAGE (rate per 1K sheets). If a black and white logo on the letter is acceptable, a Pre-print is NOT required
  6. Is it a multi page notice?
  7. Any tear off section included in notices?
  8. Does notice require a return envelope?
  9. Has insert marketing or informational page or disclosure?

 **Data**

  1. Obtain job list (major and minor codes) to print notices
  2. Identify anchor for individual customer details if there are multiple notice types in single data file
  3. Is there grouping ? Notices with same customer address and name will be grouped into one envelope
  4. Process other letters Ex: welcome letters or financial notices along with the daily notice?
  5.  **Mask/Unmask** account number for print vs electronic. Does client require account numbers masked in the notice? If yes, the data file must be sent to us without masking in order for us to provide account number indexing information for PDF archival and/or eStatements

 **Suppression**

  1.  ******Invalid Address:** Print and mail first class and have the USPS return any that they can't deliver via their normal postal channel, or suppress those invalid addresses from print and provide a report to the CU.  If we provide  a report it will post to InfoImage's ftp site in the client pick up folder.  CU to provide email addresses of who needs to be alerted when it posts.  Email aliases work best for this in case someone is out of the office or changes positions
  2.  ******Custom handling:** Any special handling in case of unknown product types or missing aaplicationID Generate a report back to FTP client folder? Does CU have a preferred report format?

          Ex: CID_loanprocessing_unknown_loantype_<mmddyy>_<seg#>.csv.pgp)

               CID_loanprocessing_missing_appId_<mmddyy>_<seg#>.csv.pgp)

 **       3\. Invalid address** : Suppress and provide a report back in the
FTP client pick up folder. Confirm file naming convention for report.

                Ex:  CID_[app]_invalid_mail_address_<mmddyyyy>_<Seg#>.csv.pgp

 **PDF Archival to DVD or PDF -** Refer PDF archival smartsheet for checklist
and questions to CU

  1. In case of multiple daily notice, confirm archival retention period be different for each daily notice or same for entire application? 
  2. Zip filename Ex:  CID_<loannotice>_<yyyymmdd>_seq.zip
  3. Password protected
  4. PDF and index file. Each zip file will contain 200 pdfs and associated one index file
  5. Index file naming covention Ex: CID_<loannotice>_<date/printDate>_<seq>.xml
  6. PDF file naming convention Ex: <loannotice>_<date/printDate> _<account no>_<seq>.pdf
  7. Index contents in xml format
  8. Index contents in xml format

  

 **BA - Notes: **

  1. Check if there is a pre process
  2. Key data fields we need to capture across all data file formats
  3. Account Number (w/o Leading zeros)
  4. Maximum 6 address lines
  5. Statement / Notice Date (used primary for eStatements, but should be mapped out regardless if they have eStatements or not)
  6. Need to capture the Begin Date and the Closing Date. If begin date is not available, then use the same value as the closing date.
  7. App Code (used primary for InfoIMAGE's eStatement solution); Generally Credit Union systems like Jack Henry Symi
  8. Because the Account Number may overlap between application types, it is critical that we need to have different application types such as DDA, SAV, Loans, CD, Safe Deposit Box, etc .
