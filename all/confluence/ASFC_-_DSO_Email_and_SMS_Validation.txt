## Goals

  * Enhance ECL process to update both email and sms.
  * Update Enrollment Step 3 to validate user information using email and/or sms.
  * Remove SMS input from MFA
  * Remove SMS update from Profile

## Background and strategic fit

Client's request

## Assumptions

  * ASFC will provide both email and sms in the ECL file.
  * User must have either an email or sms on file in order to sign up for sms. However, both is not required.
  * If the user provides an email and the user does not have an email on file, it will be ignored. The same is true for sms.

2.1| DSO Enrollment Step 3| As ASFC, I would like to validate the user's email
and/or address during DSO enrollment.|  _Must Have_|

  * Two more validation fields: Email and Phone Number
  * Validation logic:
    1. If email exists in np, email must match. Before matching, trim the input to remove leading/trailing spaces. On mobile, the space prevention may not work.
    2. If phone number exists in np, phone number must match.
    3. If neither email nor phone number exists in np, after the user submit, return to login page with error message.
  * Error messages:
    1. When email and/or sms don't match: We were unable to validate your information. Ensure the information you have entered is accurate.
    2. When email and sms don't exist in np: In order to sign up, you must have an email or phone number on file. Please contact us to update your contact information.

## Questions

Below is a list of questions to be addressed as a result of this requirements
document:

Question| Outcome  
---|---  
  
1\. Are we planning to support updating both email and SMS for other clients
as well? or is it just going to be ASFC specific? If we support this for other
clients which np type will be the selected one?

| Yes, let's have it be global. Keep the same np preference logic as before,
which I believe to be default to email before sms. This should then be
"backward compatible". The only difference now is that we are storing both
email and sms.  
2\. During SSO email is being updated. So after we process an ECL and user log
in with SSO before registering with DSO, if there is a different email in the
SSO file the email will be updated. Now if the user wants to register with DSO
if he provides the email of the ECL file it won't find a match. What will be
the expected behavior here? |  
  
  
## Not Doing
