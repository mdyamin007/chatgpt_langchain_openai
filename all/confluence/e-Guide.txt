body: ### Code Implementation

  * 4 Environments

    * Development

    * Pilot

    * Stage

    * Production

  * Processing UI for each environment

  * Frontend

    * CSS

    * HTML

    * JS

    * JSP

    * Meteor

  * Backend

    * Tomcat

    * Apache

    * Resin

    * Hibernate

    * Spring (DAO)

  * Database

    * MongoDB

    * Oracle

  

  

### Resin

  * Only one client, migrating to Hypercube soon

### Prism

  * Prism is older than Hypercube
  * Trunk is like 'Master' on git
  * Tags are "versions" checkpoints/safe rollbacks
  * SSO Client Test page
    *  Hash tool to view/test user-facing site
    * <http://resindev.infoimageinc.com:9999/ssoRequest/autoComplete/hypercubeSSO.html>
  * Admin Test Page
    * Use Hash tool to view admin-facing site
    * <http://client-test.infoimageinc.com:8070/admin/>

### Hypercube

  * Client SSO is used for Hypercube but not the Admin SSO
  * Instead, InfoTRAC is used to make admin-side changes
  * Properties.json is similar to "define" for Prism
  * Public vs Private folders
  * Public houses the css, js files
  * Private is where assets and CIDs are stored
  * Routes are serving up actual html pages
  * Double handshake logic stored in?

eStatement Processing (overview)

  

  1. Raw data is sent over from client(s)
    1. Cripple Statement Data
    2. PCL Statement Data
    3. Reconciliation Data
    4. Check Image Data
  2. IS converts data into usable format for Production team, and eStmt team
    1. Print files (Production Team)
    2. Internal Index Files 
      1. Index files serve as the 'blueprint' for data and files to be correctly sorted to the respective user
    3. Individual eStmt Docs
  3. eStatement Posting
    1. eNotification
    2. Document Archived
    3. Metadata stored in DB
  4. eStatements can be viewed by Clients, and Users

### CID

  * Client data is processed and stored in respective folders, separate from other clients
  * EWBB sends various types of data
  * IS sorts and coverts EWBB data, and creates AFPs/Index files
  * Processing UI executes  

    * Creates eStatement
    * Stores PDF into PV-NAS
    * Stores AFP/Index files into Process Folder
    * eStatement Notification Sent
  * Backup Processes Runs
    * Process Folder files transferred into Backup Process Folder
    * PDFs in PV-NAS transferred into Backup PV-NAS
  * eStatement PDF is viewable by Client and Users portals
