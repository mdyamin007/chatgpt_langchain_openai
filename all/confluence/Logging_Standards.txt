 **Toggleable Debug Mode**

By default, do not log any sensitive information: CIF, Account Numbers, Email
Address.

Make sure logs are still descriptive enough for certain form of research.

Have a debug mode toggleable by CID. We have to turn this on for the sensitive
information to be printed out. Potentially, this will go to a different log
file: hypercube-debug.log.

Implications:

  1. We will have limited ability to research past issues.  **So this is dependent on whether the ability to do research outweighs the security**.
  2. When an issue is reported, we have the ability to turn on debug mode. Then the client/OLB vendor will need to make additional new requests for us to see the full debug log.

DELETE the debug log once research period is over.

Ideally, debug log maybe should also be filtered by CIDs. In fact, the normal
log should be split out by CIDs, too.

  

On the proxies, we can also do something similar. Right now, some clients have
the request body printed out. We should hide that request body, and it should
be toggled on only when needed. Again, we lose research capability into past
incidents.
