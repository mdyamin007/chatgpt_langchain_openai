title: ANT
body: 1)Stop resin servers (PUI and MemberSite)

2)Make sure your changes are checked into the branch. Currently we already
have build.xml in processing-ui and i3-core project * processing - ant run the
build.xml of corresponding branch * i3-core - ant run the build.xml of
corresponding branch

Explanation:  
When ant is run , it will do clean, compile and deploy the jar to the right
location on server  
tweaked build2.xml with a new target "copyjars" to deploy the jar to right
resin folder ( is it always the same???)

Would need to configure build.xml per environment so that the jars are
deployed to right location for both both PUI server and Member site server  
( _C:\Users\jchacko >ant -buildfile C:\workspace\development\Processing-UI-
dev\processing-ui\build2PUI.xml_  
 _C:\Users\jchacko >ant -buildfile C:\workspace\development\i3-Core-
dev\i3-core\build2_I3.xml_  
 _C:\Users\jchacko >ant -buildfile C:\workspace\development\i3-Core-
dev\i3-core\build2_I3.xml copyjars_ (for specific targets)

3)Downloaded ant locally and followed the installation instructions from Ant
website. Was able to run ant targets from command line in the older in which
is defined in build.xml. Can't run one out of order??? Not sure why.

4)Eclipse has ant plugin so you don't need to install ant seperately if you
are running the build file in eclipse. Didn't know how to run a specific
target
