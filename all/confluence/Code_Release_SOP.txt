title: Code Release SOP
body: Please follow the following procedures when releasing code through to
production/

There's no such thing as being too careful when releasing to production.
Always double, triple check your work!

  

  1. Prepare and fill out the [release note document](https://confluence.infoimageinc.com/pages/createpage-entervariables.action?templateId=87359489&spaceKey=IN&title=&newSpaceKey=IN)
  2. Grab a team member to witness the release. The witness's responsibility is to ensure all code release steps are done correctly and to be a 2nd pair of eyes.
  3. Review the release note document with the team member and verbally check off the items that need to be committed
  4. Commit the changes to the production branch. **This same branch should be used on staging for final QA.**
  5. Run the necessary jenkins job to deploy the code
  6. Bounce all the necessary servers. Confirm via the logs that each server came up successfully.
  7. If possible, manually confirm on production few basic checks (Ex. Able to log in, pull statements, etc).
  8. Notify the AC/Imp that release was completed and **have the client confirm.**
