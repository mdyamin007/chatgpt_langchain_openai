body: ### **What Code Can Be Unit-Tested**

The purpose of a unit test is to test a single method. For this reason, not
all code can be tested via unit testing. Certain areas of code rely on
multiple dependencies such as connection to a database, which cannot be tested
with a unit test. Integration testing is needed to test integrated systems.
However, there are things we can do to refactor our code so that a lot of the
code can be unit tested. They are: separating codes into layers, applying
Single Responsibility Principle, and ensuring that most functions return some
value/class that can be validated in this manner: f(x) = y.

###  **Separation into Different Code Layers**

Certain types of codes are difficult to test, or require a specific way of
testing that is not conducive to unit testing. When identified, all code of a
certain type should be separated into a layer that can be validated in its own
set of tests.

One example is code that require database connection. All data access objects
should be separated into their own layer of code, and validated in a different
suite of tests. The data access objects should only read/write data to the
databases and perform no other operations. We technically already have this in
the form of the i3-core classes. These classes should not need to be changed
significantly, but it is a good idea to review each class individually and
refactor them, too.

###  **Single Responsibility Principle**

Single responsibility principle is typically applied to classes. It is my
opinion that it can also be applied to functions. One function should
accomplish one single purpose. That way, it is less likely that the function
will need to be changed. The less changes we make to existing functions, the
less likely we are to make errors. As our code base grow, changing existing
functions will become more and more complex as more and more of our code will
be using the specific function. Additionally, if the function has multiple
responsibilities, we would have to be careful and analyze that we do not break
any of the different responsibiltiies that the function has. If the function
has only one purpose, then we would only need to analyze that single purpose.

Functions with single responsibility are also easier to explain, and as a
result, easier to maintain.

### Example

#### DAO Layer

FinanceAccountBean

FinanceAccountDBAccess

UserManager

etc

#### Business Logic Layer

Some input -> Object class or value

AccountHandler

createAccount - create a FinAccount object and return that object; the
function MUST NOT insert the object into the database

  * The returned FinAccount object can be validated.
  * There is one single responsibility and that is to create the FinAccount. Inserting the record into the database should be done in a separate function.

UserHandler

createUserDetails - create a UserDetails object

createUserProfile - create a UserProfile object

createUserMapping - create a UserMapping object

createUserFinAccount

createUser - create a user using the createUserDetails, createUserProfile,
createUser functions

  * should return an object that contains UserDetails, UserProfile AND UserMapping - this can then all be validated

createSubUser - same as createUser, but handle additional subUser logic

#### Processing Layer

A complex processing function, may then do this:

  1. user=UserHandler.createUser();
  2. account = AccountHandler.createAccount();
  3. ufa = UserHandler.createUserFinAccount(user,account)
  4. DAO.store(user.getUserDetails)
  5. DAO.store(user.getUserProfile)
  6. DAO.store(user.getUserMapping)
  7. DAO.store(account)
  8. DAO.store(ufa)

With this setup, we can test the createAccount function independent of the
need to connect to a database. We can validate that given a set of input, the
FinanceAccountBean being returned will have the correct information. We assume
that the DAO are valid and will do the correct insertion/update, given that
the objects we pass to the DAO have the correct information.

Not all functions have to fit into this format. For example, currently with
UserMapping, we use UserManager.attachCifToUser(), this is a DAO function that
can still be leveraged. We should, though, have the DAO takes in a data object
instead of straight up values. That way, at least we can validate that our
code is giving the DAO the correct value.

Ideally, the Processing Layer should not have its own logic, and should only
be using functions from other layers. There are certain functionalities like
sending emails, etc. but those could also be refactored into using common
code. If the Processing Layer needs its own logic, the responsibilities should
be encapsulated into separate classes with Single Responsibility so that they
can also be easily unit tested.
