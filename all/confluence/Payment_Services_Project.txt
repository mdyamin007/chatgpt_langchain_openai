Notes from 19-Jan Meeting  
\---------------------------  
1\. EPAY_TRANSACTION table will hold all EPX call does not matter it is for
Validation or BRIC creation or Payment. There will be one Column CALL_BY in
Table which will hold one of these value.  
2\. In case Multiple Wrong Entered Values , for Example Chose wrong card type
