body: **Subject:**  Member Profile Service - Design doc Review  
 **Date & Time:** Thurs, Aug 29, 2013 @3:30pm-4:30pm PST  
 **Venue:**  Conf Room-1  
 **Attendees:**  BenC, Dharmi, Kevin and Niraj

#  **Agenda**

  * Design doc walkthrough & review with team

 **Minutes of Meeting**

The Member Profile Service- Design doc was presented & discussed during the
meeting.  
Given below points discussed and changes suggested:

  1. Reuse SAFE/SSCU- Instant Enrollment MySQL DB Transaction Table for the Member Profile Service
    * DB transaction Table needs purging policy (3 months) keeping in view of daily transaction volume
  2. Suggestion: Need daemon process/workflow to monitor the status for grace period and broadcast the email alerts.
    * Use & expand existing service (SAFE/SSCU - Instant Enrollment) to include the Member Profile service
  3. JSON Payload - Move eSafetyBox fields to reside outside of custom fields body
  4. Remove HTTP Resources URI for REMOVE/UPDATE. It can be taken-up for phase-2 implementation.
    * Also, update last row of table for the Member Resource for update/PUT instead of POST
    * Take out member accounts (first row of table). Merge 2nd row with 5th row of table
  5. Add details about the notification service integration and state management under the Implementation doc
  6. Add Resource URL for the /members/search for member profile search feature.
    * Currently, search by "status" only. Under next release, it can be extended for other fields e.g. account number etc.

 **Action Items:**

  * Documentation - Based on the review comments, update Design doc. Also, prepare Implementation doc
