title: Monthly Statements
body: ## _Check Image Data Files (Statement Application ONLY):_

Note:  Usually Banks require check images;  Sometime Credit Unions may require
check image as well if they have a small business statements

  * Do your statements have check pages?  If no, you can skip this entire section.
  * Who is your item processor?
  * Please note, we require check images sent to us daily.  Most of our clients generally send us check images 5 days a week but we do have a very large client that send us check images 7 days a week.  When do you generate check images and what time of day will you send it us to process  _automatically_.
  * Is FI only displaying check image items or are they displaying other images like deposit slips?
  * Can FI provide the last 45 days before live date worth of check image files to have necessary images for first production day?

  * InfoIMAGE has a standard cripple rate logic that we apply to all applications if we are creating the check pages from the  _individual_ check images.  Typically most of our clients choose 2% cripple rate; however, you can choose a different cripple during the implementation.   If cannot decide the cripple rate now, you can decide later when we do our cripple rate testing, but for now, we will use 2%.  When our processing detect a high cripple rate, our processing program will halt and our team will contact you to review the cripple report to confirm if we should proceed or wait for you to send us the missing check images. 
  * Can you provide us an email address of who you want to be notified when the cripple report is available for download?  
  * What is the check image layout do you prefer or is it set in the data file? 

5 incomplete 2 x 5  (most common)   6 incomplete 2 x 6  (....) 7 incomplete ..
8 incomplete ...

  

  

  * Do you want us to print Front only or Front & Back Images?

  

Note, the following cores have tag defining a individual customer preference
of front or front & back or none (i.e. truncated statements)

  * Do you have a combined statement with multiple checking accounts?  We need to get a sample combined account number to review so that we can confirm that we are pulling the correct check items for the correct checking account number for this combined statement file?
