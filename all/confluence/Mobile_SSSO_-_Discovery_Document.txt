SSO for a client

## Step-by-step guide in Setting Mobile SSO up

Below are the steps to get Mobile SSO setup for your client

  1. Does client expect Mobile SSO to be used from the mobile devices' web browsers only? Or any native mobile app? 
  2. If native mobile app, who is the vendor?
  3. Look into partnerships with cores to allow us to find similarities as cores may have preferred app creators/vendors and understand how they work
  4. FIs have their own native apps, so will need to test this feature
  5. Have FIs contact us over changes on their apps and if it will affect us/setup

  

This will hold a screenshot of a team support ticket set up so that this is
repeatable.
