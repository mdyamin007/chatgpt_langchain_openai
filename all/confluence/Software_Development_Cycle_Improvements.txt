title: Software Development Cycle Improvements
body:   

  
| Improvement| Description  
---|---|---  
1| Automated unit test/integration tests| All softwares need to have unit
tests and integration tests developed to ensure that bugs do not get released.  
2| Internal code repo (JFrog)| Shared code does not need to be re-implemented.
Each application can choose what version of the package to build with; thus,
an update will not have an impact across all applications.  
3| CI/CD| Better pipelines and automations. When properly integrated with
testing, we can achieve same-day deployment.  
4| AWS| Reduce costs of maintenance, hardware, and certain devOps tasks. May
be a good fit for business since not all of our applications need to be
running at all times. Most of our traffic comes from month's end. AWS handle
automatic scaling of resources.
