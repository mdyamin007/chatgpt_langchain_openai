  * Determine file naming convention for inbound and outbound file. Here is a list of the common field names we must have in order to recognize their data file:
  *  **CID** : InfoIMAGE's 4 digit client id (e.g. bfcu - BayFederal Credit Union; ewbb - East West Bank); Our program must have this unique field to help confirm the data file being used corresponds to the program we wrote. It is a preventative measure to not use the program to run another client's data file.  Our contract team and/or IMP team will provide what our CID is at the beginning of the implemenation project.
  *  **Cycle** **Date** : We try to encourage the client to use the same cycle date that the statement/notices. However, we do encounter some clients that are unable to use the cycle date associated to the contents of the data file. If that is the case, system date is acceptable. Common date format can be: MMDDYYYY and MMDDYY.
  *  **Segment** **Number** : Segment numbers are used whenever there is multiple files processed in the same day. There will be setups where clients will state that there will rarely or never be another set of files sent in one business day. If that is case, we still want the client to hard the number "1" in the file naming convention. Our programming needs to be flexible to run multiple times a day without overwriting the first segment.

Above are the three minimum data fields requirements needed in the file naming
conventions. Typical delimiter between these fields is "_". In addition to the
three fields, you always need to include a small descriptive fixed application
name that can be anything. e.g. _ewbb_dda_{MMDDYYYY}_{SEG#}.txt.pgp_

  * Email confirmation for file receipt

  * File arrival
  * File missing
