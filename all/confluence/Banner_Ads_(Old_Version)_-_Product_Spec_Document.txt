#### What is Banner Ads?

|

#### Product Overview

Banner advertising refers to the use of a rectangular graphic display that
stretches across the top, bottom, or sides of a website or online media
property. The horizontal type of banner advertisement is called a leaderboard,
while the vertical banners are called a skyscraper and are positioned on a web
page's sidebars. Banner ads are image-based rather than text-based and are a
popular form of online advertising.

Using the admin portal, the financial institution can upload one or more web
banners for each banner area. If multiple banners are provided for a banner
area, then they will be rotating in a carousel fashion. Selective criteria
such as user targeting are not available for global banner ads - they will
universally apply/display for each user. Please refer to the Offer Management
module for the offer/ad-related targeting and advanced management features. A
click tracking report is available for banners if chosen only on this version.

#### Features Include

  * Banner Placement Options
  * Full-Color Ads

  
  
#### Where does Banner Ads fit?

|

#### Client's Fit

This feature enables the Financial Institution to enable one or more areas in
the eStatement User Portal for this display. Banner ads are image-based rather
than text-based and are a popular form of online advertising. The purpose of
banner advertising is to promote a brand and/or to get visitors from the host
website to go to the advertiser's website, in our case this would be the FI's
ability to market certain products to their customers.
