  * The Codepage box should have a **CDP** extension
  * The Characterset box should have a **CHS** extension
  * Check the System default Cdp box
  * Set the Target resolution to **300** dpi
  * Leave the Language box alone, it should be set at **0**
  * Select **Pc** AFPDS Type box
  * Leave the Use UNICODE (Wide) output empty (i.e. not checked)
  * For the Family text input box, type in the family code (refer to ).  Define the 2 letter initial of the font and make sure it currently does not exist in the font code column in the list of fonts installed table.  For the 4rd character, use:

  

0 for Norma **l**|  1 = Semi| 2 = Light  
---|---|---  
B for Bold| C = Semi Bold| D = Light Bold  
I for Italic| F = Semi Italic| G = Light Italic  
J for Bold Italic| K = Semi Bold Italic| L = Light Bold  
  
  

e.g:

AR0 = Arial Normal

ARB = Arial Bold

ARJ = Bold Italic

etc etc.

  * For the Font Cdp, choose **United States EBCDIC - #037** if work in English, choose others as needed for foreign language application
