title: Uploading resources (Draft)
body: Resources will be sent as attachments via email. Additional attachments such
as an index file and before/after samples may be sent. Looking at before/after
samples is crucial to see what the differences are.

In the case that the differences between the before/after samples are
distinct, the process for uploading is as follows:

  * Save the resources to a folder on your Desktop. 
  * Log on to Core FTP.  

    * For first time users, click on Site Manager in the top left corner next to the lightning bolt symbol. 
    * Add a host by clicking on New Site in the bottom left corner. 
    * Create a new site for three different hosts: 10.8.9.14, 10.8.9.16, and 10.8.9.9 (should I put in further details on username, password, etc) 
  * Connect to any of the three hosts by clicking on Site Manager in the top left, then clicking on Connect at the bottom of the Site Manager window. 
  * Once connected, make sure that the local directory and the host are shown side by side before continuing. 
  * On the local directory side, make sure that the resources are shown in the folder that it was saved in. 
  * For the host side, path to a2w-dev" and then to isis. 
  * Depending on the resource file type, here's the instructions for the next path:
    * If the resource is a .ovl file, path to the ovl folder. 
    * If the resource is a .300 file, path to the pseg folder. 
    * If the resource is a .tif file, path to the tiff folder
  * Once in the desired folder, transfer the resources into their respective folders by dragging or copying them over. 
  * Resurface back to the isd directory and path to a2w-prod and then isis, following the same exact steps as for a2w-dev. 
  * Once the resources are successfully transferred into the a2w-dev and a2w-prod directories, connect to the other two hosts and repeat the same process above. 

  

If the index file nor before/after samples were not sent, then ask for the
missing items respectively.

If an index file and samples are received, confirm that the updated sample
matches what is posted on the infocare(?) site.

This process is performed as follows:

  * Connect to host 10.8.9.23 in the folders(?) tab on the toolbar at the bottom of the desktop.  
  * Path to input -> I3 ->  process-files-backup. This folder should list all of the CIDs. 
  * Click on the desired CID folder, then click on the date that matches the date on the sample. 
  * Locate the index file (.txt) that was sent. If the index file is found, then that means the statements should be posted on the infocare(?) site. 
  * To confirm, navigate to the CID lookup site and type in the desired CID in the search box. Once found, dive in to the development environment to access the admin site of the infocare site. 
  * Log in to the admin site and enter the account number to see the list of statements provided. If the desired statement is shown, click and view the statement to see that it matches with the sample sent.
