## Goals

  * Fix bug where CIF is not created in processes where fin_account are created: check_image and paperless

## Background and strategic fit

Ensure all processes populate our database with the needed information for
features to function properly.

## Assumptions

  * global.autoRegister should only be true for CU that have 1-to-1 CIF-acct number relationship. This implies that the CIF is the account number.
  * If global.autoRegister is on, we will attach CIF to user using the acct number as the CIF num.

## Requirements

#| Title| User Story| Importance| Notes  
---|---|---|---|---  
1| Update Check Image Process| Update the AccountRegistrar to attach CIF to
user|  _Must have_|

  * In the autoRegister block; add attach CIF to user
  * Attach CIF to user even if user exist in the case that somehow user is created, but CIF hasn't been attached yet

  
2| Update DefaultPaperlessRegistrar3| Update usr/usr_session/cif creation
logic to be independent|  _Must have_  |

  * Separate usr and usr session creation into its own logic
  * After acct is created, find UFA
  * If UFA does not exist; create usr and create usr_fin_account connection fin_account with usr_fin_account
  * Then check if usr_session exist; if not, create usr_session
  * Then reach acctLookup block
  * In the acctLookup else block, add an additional check for if CIF exist; if it doesn't create the CIF (existing line of code)
