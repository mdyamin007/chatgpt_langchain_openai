title: Email Authentication
body: Email Authentication is way to make sure that email is not forger. In other
words, it is very important in order to deliver email into Inbox of recipient.

Right now, most of the ISP provider using three email authentication
framework:

 **1\. SPF, SenderId**  (Sender Policy Framework)  
 **2\. DKIM**  (DomainKeys Identified Mail)  
  

  

## SPF

An SPF record is a type of Domain Name Service (DNS) record that identifies
which mail servers are permitted to send email on behalf of your domain.

The purpose of an SPF record is to prevent spammers from sending messages with
forged From addresses at your domain.

Recipients can refer to the SPF record to determine whether a message
purporting to be from your domain comes from an authorized mail server.

 **Example** **:**

Suppose that your domain [infoimamgeinc.com](http://infoimamgeinc.com) create
an SPF record that identifies the our hosted SMTP server as the authorized
mail servers for your domain. When a recipient's mail server receives a
message from [user@infoimamgeinc.com](mailto:user@infoimamgeinc.com), it can
check the SPF record for [infoimamgeinc.com](http://infoimamgeinc.com) to
determine whether it is a valid message.  
If the message comes from a server other than the authorized mail servers
listed in the SPF record, the recipient's mail server can reject it as spam.

 **NOTE:**  If your domain does not have an SPF record, some recipient domains
may reject messages from your users because they cannot validate that the
messages come from an authorized mail server.  
  

  

## DKIM

DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) lets an organization take responsibility for
a message that is in transit.

The organization is a handler of the message, either as its originator or as
an intermediary. Their reputation is the basis for evaluating whether to trust
the message for further handling, such as delivery.

Technically DKIM provides a method for validating a domain name identity that
is associated with a message through cryptographic authentication.

To add a digital signature to outgoing mail, you generate a 1024-bit domain
key that Google Apps uses to create signed mail headers that are unique to
your domain. You add the public key to the Domain Name System (DNS) records
for your domain. Recipients can verify the source of a mail message by
retrieving your public key and using it to confirm your signature.

 **Example** **:**

While sending an email, we have signed it using digital signature, and send it
to user having email address [xyz@gmail.com](mailto:xyz@gmail.com). Since we
have add public key to DNS, gmail will get that key from DNS, and authenticate
email using their DKIM configuration. If it validate, then it will send email
to inbox otherwise it will get insert into Spam folder.  
  

  

## Receiver Authentication Method Comparison:

 **Receiver**|  **DKIM**|  **Domain Keys**|  **SenderID**|  **SPF**  
---|---|---|---|---  
AOL| Y| N| Y| Y  
Bell Canada| Y| Y| Y| N  
AT&T/Bellsouth| Y| Y| Y| N  
Charter| N| N| N| Y  
Comcast| Y| N| Y| Y  
[Cox.net](http://Cox.net)| Y| N| N| N  
Earthlink| Y| Y| N| Y  
Gmail| Y| Y| N| Y  
United Online/Juno/NetZero| N| N| Y| Y  
Hotmail/MSN/[Live.com](http://Live.com)| Y| N| N| Y  
RoadRunner| N| N| N| Y  
Rogers Cable| Y| Y| N| Y  
Verizon| N| N| N| Y  
Yahoo! Mail| Y| Y| N| Y  
  
  

## Conclusion:

If we implement SPF and DKIM:

1\. Email Delivery to Inbox will high.  
2\. Chances of email getting into spam very less.  
3\. Impose more security.  
4\. From above table, most of the vendor are following SPF and DKIM.
