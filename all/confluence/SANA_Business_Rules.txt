## Enrollment

 SANA controls enrollment on their end, therefore we do not show the
enrollment steps when a new user logs in for the first time. As a result, the
Enrollment Status under the User Information section on InfoTRAC Account
Management can be ignored. This also means the SSO field will remain null in
the usr_session table.

## Delivery Preference

We receive paperless files for each statement type internally from IS.
