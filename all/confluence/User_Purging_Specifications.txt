title: User Purging Specifications
body: # Overview

* * *

This process will purge users identified by the Unique User Identifier. Users
will be purged along with any related information such as email address. For
setup that enables SSO via a file processing such as the Auth File, the user
will no longer be able to log in. For setup that allows SSO at-will, if the
user does try to log in again, they will be treated as a new user.

Accounts will be unlinked from the user. If the user is the last enrolled user
linked to an account, the account will be changed to Paper delivery. This is
because an account needs an enrolled user in order to be delivered
electronically.

There will be remnant user entries that are kept for auditing purposes. For
example, if a user changed the paperless status of an account, we'll need to
keep the user record to maintain the paperless status history. However, this
will be transparent to the client and customer.

 **Frequency**|  At-will

 **Completeness**|  Incremental
