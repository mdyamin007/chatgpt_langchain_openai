title: Install and Configure a Basic LDAP Server on an Ubuntu 14.04
body: ## Install and Configure a Basic LDAP Server on an Ubuntu 1404  
\---  
The OpenLDAP server is in Ubuntu's default repositories under the package
"slapd"

To get ubuntu update run the following command.

    
    
    sudo apt-get update
    

We can install LDAP and some additional utilities easily with apt-get:

    
    
    sudo apt-get install slapd ldap-utils
    

When the installation is complete, we actually need to reconfigure the LDAP
package.

    
    
    sudo dpkg-reconfigure slapd
    

In the reconfiguration process you will be asked a series of questions about
how you'd like to configure the software.

. Omit OpenLDAP server configuration?  **No**  
. DNS domain name? we can use actual domain name, in my case it is
**[test.com](http://test.com)**  
. Organization name? in my case it is  **example**  
. Administrator password? choose another one.  
. Database backend to use?  **HDB**  
. Remove the database when slapd is purged?  **No**  
. Move old database?  **Yes**  
. Allow LDAPv2 protocol?  **No**  
  

  

## We will be administering LDAP through a web interface called PHPldapadmin.

Install PHPldapadmin with this command:

    
    
    sudo apt-get install phpldapadmin
    

  

We need to configure some values within the web interface configuration files  
Open the configuration file with root privileges

    
    
    sudo nano /etc/phpldapadmin/config.php
    

  
Change the value to the way you will be referencing your server.

    
    
    $servers->setValue('server','host','domain_nam_or_IP_address');
    

  

You will need to reflect the same value you gave when asked for the DNS domain
name when we reconfigured "slapd".  
Domain components are anything that is separated by a dot.These components are
then given as values to the "dc" attribute in LDAP.  
For instance, if your DNS domain name entry was
"[dsi.test.com](http://dsi.test.com)", LDAP would need to see
"dc=dsi,dc=test,dc=com".

    
    
    $servers->setValue('server','base',array('dc=test,dc=com'));
    

The next value to modify will use the same domain components that you just set
up in the last entry. Add these after the "cn=admin" in the entry below:

    
    
    $servers->setValue('login','bind_id','cn=admin,dc=test,dc=com');
    

  
Save and close the file.

  

## Log Into the Web Interface  
You can access by following address in your web browser:

    
    
    domain_name_or_IP_address/phpldapadmin
    

##  
Click on the "login" link on the left-hand side.  
You will receive a login prompt. The correct Login DN (distinguished name)
should be pre-populated if you configured PHPldapadmin correctly. In our case,
this would be "cn=admin,dc=test,dc=com".

Enter the password you selected during our slapd configuration.  
You will be presented with a rather sparse interface initially.  

If you click on the "plus" next to the domain components (dc=test,dc=com), you
will see the admin login we are using.
