title: Creating an Epic, Gathering analysis, Creating Developer Ticket
body: This details how to create an Epic and generate a corresponding IS/ISD ticket

Step-by-step guide

  1. Look for the blue **" Create"** button on the top of the page. Click it to get started  
  
  

  2. You'll see a modal popup for you to enter in the details. Make sure the **" Project"** field is correct and the IssueType is set to "Epic"  
  
  

Epic Name and Summary fields should be identical and contain the TeamSupport #
and CID in the field somewhere seperated by a space. Example: CID -
TeamSupport# - Desc (MSBK - 111 - New Letter Setup). This allows you to easily
search it with the search bar in the top right

  

  3. There's a tab for both Print and Electronic details. This will be blank initially. When the analysis is completed, it will automatically be filled in.  

Once created, you'll be taken to the ticket details. If you're having trouble
finding the ticket, check under either "Issues" or "Kanban Board" to find it.

  

  4. Move the Epic status to "Pending Analysis" and create the IS and/or ISD ticket accordingly under **More > Create Print Analysis/Create ISD Analysis. **This will automatically create an analysis ticket for IS or ISD assessment. **  
**

  5. Once IS/ISD finishes the analysis and fills in the information into the analysis ticket. They will update the analysis status to "Analysis Completed" and details will be copied back into the Epic.  
  

  6. Once project is ready to being. Move the status to "Project Initiated" and create the corresponding IS/ISD ticket under **More > Create Print/ISD Story.** This will automatically create the story for IS/ISD and keep any necessary fields in sync (Due date, hours, etc)
