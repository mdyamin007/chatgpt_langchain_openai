title: eSignature SDK Installation
body: **Problem**  : When updating to sdk 11.0 from sdk 10.6.2, Packages were not
moving to completed status tab.

 **Solution**  : This issue was happening as packages were not able to
download from silani's, as there were missing dependencies jar, which cannot
be downloaded with using maven. Maven dependency for sdk 11.0 does not include
the dependencies jar.

Dependiences jar link :
**<http://docs.e-signlive.com/doku.php?id=esl:e-signlive_sdk>**

Go to above link and Download the e-SignLive Java SDK 11.0.zip.

Extract zip file and you will find the sdk-11.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar,
include this jar under * /infoservice/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/lib* location
and in pom.xml file include the below dependency path where we have placed the
jar

<dependency>  
<groupId>com.silanis.esl</groupId>  
<artifactId>sdk</artifactId>  
<version>11.0</version>  
<scope>system</scope>  
<systemPath>${project.basedir  
}/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/lib/sdk-11.0.jar</systemPath>  
</dependency>
