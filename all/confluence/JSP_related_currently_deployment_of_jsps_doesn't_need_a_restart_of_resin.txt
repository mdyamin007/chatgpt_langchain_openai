title: JSP related currently deployment of jsps doesn't need a restart of resin
body: Resin supports deployment of wars. The JSP hosts project, would need to be
converted to WAR project, currently they are not WAR. Don't know how to do
it????

WAR approach - wars would be per client for each root and msm, Lisa said it's
lot more work to deploy a war as opposed to just copying the jsp we modified.
Takes longer to load.For one small change everything needs to be loaded as
opposed to just a few files.

File system deployment

Resin offers file system-based "hot deployment" with which you can deploy an
application by copying it to the Resin "webapps" directory. The application
can be either in .war form or an "exploded" war. If you deploy the application
as a .war, Resin will expand and start it automatically by default.

Many developers may also prefer to copy their application in "exploded" form
for development. Resin is able to detect changes to the code base (both JSPs
and Java files) within the application and automatically recompile and
redeploy. This feature can help developers iterate quickly to see code changes
in their application.

While file system-based deployment is great for developing applications and
deploying applications on a single machine, it can be difficult to manage when
deploying to multiple machines in a cluster. Resin offers a distributed
deployment mechanism for these cases.
