title: Deployment through Jenkins
body: Suppose, we have created a new feature branch and want to deploy the branch
into development ENV of ca-infotrac-dv-01 machine. To achieve the mentioned
goal, follow the following instruction.

#  **Step 01:**

Go to Jenkins home page and give your credentials.

Link: <https://jenkins.infoimageinc.com/login?from=%2F>

# **Step 02:  **

After a successful login, you will see the ENV separated directory. As we want
to deploy the new branch on DEV, we enter into DEV directory. As our target is
to deploy this on ca-infotrac-dv-01, so we enter into that folder and after
that inter into the pipeline named **infoservice_ca-infotrac-dv-01.  **The
following pictures will give you the gist what I am trying to explain here.

  

#  **Step 03:**

We have to tell the Jenkins, which branch we want to deploy. So click
**configure  **tab from left side of the page. You have to scroll down little
to get the input field named **Branch Specifier (blank for 'any').  **In that
field you have to specify your branch name and click **apply** and then
**save** button.

  

#  **Step 04:**

Now we have to trigger a build. To do that click on **Build With Parameters
**tab which is left side of the page. You will get a page where you can
specify, how you want to trigger the new build. For instance, if you have
change the property file then you have to check the **copyAppConfigs**.
Following pictures will give you a better understand.

  

#  **Step 05:**

We are done. Now we have to see whether jenkins can pass all the stages or
not. If all stages are passed, we are done. Our new branch is deployed on ca-
infotrac-dv-01.
