title: Existing 2D Camera Feature Evaluation
body: The 'Camera' link on ETA board support the 2D camera image feature. It
comprised of mainly 3 steps outlined below.  
  

## Query Form (dds_report.php)

  * It's a static form that expose a few params for generating query in next step
  * It support ajax capability to show search results within same window
  * Date range is limited to 35 days, but most probably because of the query in next step is not constructed optimally in Query 1 & 2\. Combining the queries should raise this limitation significantly (need testing).

  
  

## Search operation (dds_reporting.php)

  * It's performing queries on the oracle/mssql database. Queries as follows:
  * Query 1: (Oracle)  
Find all the 'pieceid' based on the search param.  

    
        select pieceid, acct_num, name, code_2d 
    from dds_images 
    where <corresponding params from Query Form>

  * Query 2: (Oracle)  
Find the corresponding CID/Cycle..etc info based on the 'code_2d' value from
Query 1. Could've combine Query 1 & 2 together as an inner join.  

    
        select cid, cycle, prefix, job_name, site 
    from dds_jobs 
    where code_2d = :code_2d

  
  

## Show Captured Image with HTML form/links (load_dds_image2.php)

  * Query 3: (MSSQL, different DB instance between Menlo vs Texas)  
Fetch the 'timestamp' only of the captured image. Manual DB Sharding done via
table name of carrying first 5 digit of 'pieceid' to be table-name-suffix
(i.e. $barid)  

    
        select TimeStamp 
    from dp_jobid_$barid 
    where pieceid = $pieceid

  
  

## Fetching actual image content for <img src="image_path"> rendered in
load_dds_image2.php
(get_dds_image2.php)[](https://i3dev.easyredmine.com/projects/etaboard/wiki/Existing_2D_Camera_Feature_Evaluation#Fetching-
actual-image-content-for-ltimg-srcimage_pathgt-rendered-in-load_dds_image2php-
get_dds_image2php)

  * Query 4: (MSSQL, different DB instance between Menlo vs Texas)  
Actual image blob is stored in follow table. Could've done together with Query
3 above.  

    
        select roi 
    from dp_jobid_$barid 
    where pieceid = $pieceid
