title: Net Teller SSO (BBBB, EDCU, EECU)
body: HTML Form to log-in to Net Teller SSO

  

  

Search in the Catalina logs for real log-in attempt to pull certain values
from.

Sometimes it is not obvious which CID the HBLOGIN is for. For BBBB, their
password is bbbb. The image above is for EECU.

Look in the access log to see when the hblogin.jsp was called. In the image
above, There was a GET request for /hblogin.jsp at 7:43:51. In the HBLOGIN
image, the login occurred around 7:44, using the timestamp at the bottom. This
suggests that there is a very high chance that the HBLOGIN we are looking at
belongs to EECU.
