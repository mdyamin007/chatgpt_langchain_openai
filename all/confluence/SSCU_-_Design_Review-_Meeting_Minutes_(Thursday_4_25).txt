## SSCU PathWays Instant Enrollment - Design Review

 **Subject:**  SSCU PathWays Instant Enrollment:: Design Document Review  
 **Date & Time:** Thurs 04/25 @12:00pm PST  
 **Venue:**  Conf Room #1  
 **Attendees:**  Will, David, Alice and Niraj

 **Agenda**

  1. Design document review (covering Mule-ESB Implementation)
  2. Q&A

  
  

###  **Meeting Minutes:**

  1. Team walkthru the design doc specification (available on Redmine wiki site).
    * High-level design & implementation discussed & agreed.
    * As per the design, Mule-ESB will have 2 REST/JSON API in order to fulfill the requirements.
  2. Suggestions provided for async processing during the Fiserv downtime/regular maintenance window (19:30-231:00 hrs daily). Mule-ESB Service will post message to ActiveMQ and will perform retry at regular intervals to make a call to Fiserv Server. Finally, transaction will be stored into the Transaction Table at Mule-ESB DB. In case of expired/timed-out requests (beyond 5-hrs), it will send an email alert with transaction records status.
  3. Additional suggestions:
    * DB Table name - make a generic table name to store the Client Id and secret token details.
    * REST API - add one more API to update the email-id in the InfoDB by fetching the data from Fiserv Core-DB. This usecase scenario will be applicable for the Andera and NAOP related transactions.
    * Point raised by David for popup message at the web-application end. User may see pop-up during every login, which may not leave good user experience. David's team will discuss it offline.

  

###  **Action Items:**

  1. Documentation - Update Design document (on wiki site) with suggested changes.

 **Next Steps:**

  1. Mule-ESB Implementation -
    * Build REST/JSON Service for PathWays Instant Enrollment Service.
    * Setup DB table for PathWays Transactional data.
    * Get database table details from David having Account number and email-id related field values.
    * Share & publish reason-code list-of-values, which will be used as an input to the REST API call.
  2. Service development & testing using Mule-ESB V3.x
    * eStatement web-application team will also work on the similar development changes.
  3. Weekly meeting/discussion in order to discuss the status & issue.
  4. PathWays Server URL - Alice is following it up with SSCU
