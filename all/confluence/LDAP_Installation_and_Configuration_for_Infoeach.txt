title: LDAP Installation and Configuration for Infoeach
body: ## Introduction:

This wiki is about how to install and configure  _ **" openLDAP"**_ and  _ **"
phpldapadmin"**_. For this process we will need some files (ldap_dump.ldif,
user.schema and client.schema). All this files are attached below.

## Schema files:

On LDAP there are lots of build in classes like account, country, device,
domain etc. which defines corresponding objects. But for  _ **InfoReach**_  we
will need two different objects which will define our  _ **client**_  and  _
**user**_  objects.  _ **client.schema**_  and  _ **user.schema**_  are those
classes. When we will import this two files  _ **Client**_  and  _ **User**_
class will be added on LDAP.

 **Client class:**  
This class has 26 attributes.

#  _Required Attributes:_

  * clientId
  * clientName
  * clientType
  * parentId

#  _Optional Attributes:_

  * accountCoordinatorId
  * accountManagerId
  * accountServiceManagerId
  * address
  * bAddress
  * bCaTaxRate
  * bCity
  * bEmail
  * bFax

The following image will give you better understanding about  _ **User**_
class:

  
  

## Copy files:

Please copy the files on the "/home/" directory or your current directory of
terminal. You can check your current directory with the following command.

> pwd

At first we have to copy those files on the remote machine with the following
commands. Please execute this commands one by one.

> scp ldap_dump.ldif aurick@10.0.0.133:/home/  
> scp user.schema aurick@10.0.0.133:/home/  
> scp client.schema aurick@10.0.0.133:/home/

In here  _ **" aurick"**_ is the remote PC's username and  _ **"
10.0.0.133"**_ is that PC's IP address. And  _ **" /home/"**_ is the directory
location. In your case you have to use your own PC's username and IP address.  
  

## Connect to remote PC by SSH:

Please run the following command on terminal to connect on remote PC through
SSH:

> ssh [aurick@10.0.0.133](mailto:aurick@10.0.0.133)

In here "aurick" is the remote PC's username and "10.0.0.133" is that PC's IP
address. In your case you have to use your own PC's username and IP address.  
  

## Update repository:

Now we are connected on remote PC through SSH. Please copy the following
command and run it on terminal for update that PC's repository.

> sudo apt-get update

## Steps for Install openLDAP:

  * Please copy the following command and run it on terminal.

> sudo apt-get install slapd ldap-utils

# While installing it will prompt for admin password. Please enter a suitable
password In my case I use  _ **aurick**_.

  * Now run the following command.

> sudo dpkg-reconfigure slapd

#  **There are quite a few new questions that will be asked as you go through
this process. Let's go over these now:**  
 **1\. Omit OpenLDAP server configuration?**

  * Please choose  _ **" No"**_ and press enter. Because we will configure LDAP. By default  _ **" No"**_ is selected. if not then use  _ **" Tab"**_ button to choose  _ **" No"**_.

#  **2\. DNS domain name?**

  * This option will determine the base structure of your directory path. Read the message to understand exactly how this will be implemented.
  * This is actually a rather open option. You can select whatever "domain name" value you'd like, even if you don't own the actual domain. However, if you have a domain name for the server, it's probably wise to use that.
  * For now we will be using  _ **" infoimageinc.com"**_.

#  **3\. Organization name?**

  * This is again pretty much entirely up to your preferences.
  * For now we will be using  _ **" infoimageinc"**_ as the name of our organization.

#  **4\. Administrator password?**

  * While installation we already give an admin password, this is your real opportunity to select an administrator password. Anything we select here will overwrite the previous password we used.

#  **5\. Database backend?**

  * Please select  _ **" HDB"**_. Use  _ **" Tab"**_ button to choose  _ **" HDB"**_ if not selected by default.

#  **6\. Remove the database when slapd is purged?**

  * Please select  _ **" No"**_ then press enter. Use  _ **" Tab"**_ button to choose  _ **" No"**_ if not selected by default.

#  **7\. Move old database?**

  * Please select  _ **" Yes"**_ then press enter. Use  _ **" Tab"**_ button to choose  _ **" Yes"**_ if not selected by default.

#  **8\. Allow LDAPv2 protocol?**

  * Please select  _ **" No"**_ then press enter. Use  _ **" Tab"**_ button to choose  _ **" No"**_ if not selected by default.

 **9\. We are done with reconfiguration.**  
  

##  Steps for install phpldapadmin:

Please copy the following command and run it on the terminal.

> sudo apt-get install phpldapadmin

## Steps for configure  _" phpldapadmin"_ to  _" openldap"_:

Now we will edit the  _ **" phpldapadmin/config.php"**_ Please copy the
following command and run it on the terminal.

> sudo nano /etc/phpldapadmin/config.php

  * In this file, we need to add the configuration details that we set up for our LDAP server. We will first edit the following line which contains the IP of "openldap"  

$servers->setValue('server','host','127.0.0.1');

    
          
    

  
I use localhost=127.0.0.1 because my  _ **" phpldapadmin"**_ and  _ **"
openldap"**_ running on the same machine. If your  _ **" openldap"**_ running
on a remote server please use that server's IP address instead  _
**127.0.0.1**_.

  * Next up, we will need to configure the domain name that we selected for our LDAP server. We will edit the following line.  

$servers->setValue('server','base',array('dc=example,dc=com'));

    
          
    

  
We already used "[infoimageinc.com](http://infoimageinc.com)" for this
installation. You will use your own one. This need to be converted on LDAP
format. Like:  

$servers->setValue('server','base',array('dc=infoimageinc,dc=com'));

    
          
    

  * Now we will do the same thing for next parameter.  

    
        $servers->setValue('login','bind_id','cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com');
    

  
The cn parameter is already set as "admin". This is correct. We just need to
adjust the dc portions again, just as we did above:  

$servers->setValue('login','bind_id','cn=admin,dc=infoimageinc,dc=com');

    
          
    

  * Then we will edit the following line:  

$servers->setValue('server','name','My LDAP Server');

    
          
    

  
I use the name "InfoIMAGEInc". You will use your own LDAP Server name.  

$servers->setValue('server','name','InfoIMAGEInc');

    
          
    

  * At last we will have to uncomment and edit the following line.  

// $config->custom->appearance['hide_template_warning'] = false;

    
          
    

  
On the terminal press  _ **" Ctrl+w"**_ and search for  _
**hide_template_warning**_. Uncomment that line and replace  _ **" false"**_
by  _ **" true"**_.  

$config->custom->appearance['hide_template_warning'] = true;

    
          
    

  
Press  _ **" Ctrl+x"**_ then type  _ **" y"**_ and then press Enter to save
the file.

We almost finished this process. Now restart LDAP by running the following
command on the terminal.

> sudo /etc/init.d/slapd restart

Now we need to make sure we successfully installed LDAP. On web browser please
type.

> 10.0.0.133/phpldapadmin
>
>  
> In your case you will use your own server's IP address:

 **Press enter** , you will see the login page. Our  **Login DN**  is

    
    
    cn=admin,dc=infoimageinc,dc=com
    

#  
In your case please replace "infoimageinc" and "com" portion with your domain
and use your password for login.

  

## Add custom attributes:

At first edit the following file by running this command on terminal:

> sudo nano /etc/ldap/slapd.d/cn\=config/olcDatabase\=\\{0\\}config.ldif

Paste this lines at the end of the file.

olcRootDN: cn=admin,cn=config  
olcRootPW: aurick

    
    
      
    

#  
Please replace  _ **" aurick"**_ with your password.  
Press  _ **" Ctrl+x"**_ then type  _ **" y"**_ and press enter to save the
file.  
 _ **Note:**_  Do not keep any extra new line while pasting. Otherwise it may
cause problem.

  

Now we need to restart  _ **slapd**_. Please copy the following command and
run it on terminal:

> sudo /etc/init.d/slapd restart

### Now we need to test whether we successfully completed this process or not.

Please copy the following command and execute on the terminal:

> ldapwhoami -H ldapi:/// -D "cn=admin,cn=config" -x -w aurick

Please replace  _ **" aurick"**_ with your password. This is the password that
you use above on  _ **" olcRootPW"**_ this command return:  _ **"
dn:cn=admin,cn=config"**_ then it's OK!!  
  

## Adding entry for client:

  * At first we need to copy  _ **client.schema**_  file on  _ **" /etc/ldap/schema/"**_ location. Please copy the following command and execute it on terminal.

> sudo cp client.schema /etc/ldap/schema/

  * Create a directory by running the following command:

> sudo mkdir /tmp/ldifOutput

  * Now edit the following file by running this command:

> sudo nano /etc/ldap/ldap.conf

Then copy and paste this 4 lines at the end of the file:

include         /etc/ldap/schema/core.schema  
include         /etc/ldap/schema/cosine.schema  
include         /etc/ldap/schema/inetorgperson.schema  
include         /etc/ldap/schema/client.schema

    
    
      
    

  

  * Same as before edit this file by running the following command:

> sudo nano ./convert.conf

Now copy and paste this 4 lines at the end of the file:

include         /etc/ldap/schema/core.schema  
include         /etc/ldap/schema/cosine.schema  
include         /etc/ldap/schema/inetorgperson.schema  
include         /etc/ldap/schema/client.schema

    
    
      
    

  

  * After that run the following command to create "client.ldif" file:

> sudo slapcat -f ./convert.conf -F /tmp/ldifOutput -n0 -s
> 'cn={3}client,cn=schema,cn=config' > client.ldif

Edit the following file with this command:

> sudo nano ./client.ldif

Change  _ **" dn: cn={3}client,cn=schema,cn=config"**_ to  _ **" dn:
cn={4}client,cn=schema,cn=config"**_ and  _ **" cn: {3}client"**_ to  _ **"
cn: {4}client"**_. After that remove all lines from:  _ **"
structuralObjectClass"**_ to end.

  * At last we need to add this entry for client on ldap. Please use this command:

> sudo ldapadd -x -W -D 'cn=admin,cn=config' -W -f ./client.ldif

If the output is  _ **adding new entry "cn={4}client,cn=schema,cn=config"**_
then we successfully added the entry for client.

Now we need to restart  _ **slapd**_. Please copy the following command and
run it on terminal:

> sudo /etc/init.d/slapd restart

## Adding entry for user:

  * At first we need to copy  _ **user.schema**_  file on  _ **" /etc/ldap/schema/"**_ location. Please copy the following command and execute on terminal.

> sudo cp user.schema /etc/ldap/schema/

  * This process is similar as "client". But first we need to run this three command one by one on the terminal.

> sudo rm ./local.ldif  
> sudo rm -r /tmp/ldifOutput  
> sudo mkdir /tmp/ldifOutput

  * Now edit the following file with this command.

> sudo nano /etc/ldap/ldap.conf

Then add the following line at the end of the file.

include         /etc/ldap/schema/user.schema

    
    
      
    

#  
Press  _ **" Ctrl+x"**_ then type y and then press Enter to save the file.

  

  * Same as before edit this file by running the following command.

> sudo nano ./convert.conf

And add the following line at the end of the file:

include         /etc/ldap/schema/user.schema

    
    
      
    

#  
Press  _ **" Ctrl+x"**_ then type  _ **" y"**_ and then press  _ **" Enter"**_
to save the file.

  

Now we need to restart  _ **slapd**_. Please copy the following command and
run it on terminal:

> sudo /etc/init.d/slapd restart

  * After that run the following command to create  _ **" user.ldif"**_ file.

> sudo slapcat -f ./convert.conf -F /tmp/ldifOutput -n0 -s
> 'cn={3}client,cn=schema,cn=config' > user.ldif

Edit the following file by.

> sudo nano ./user.ldif

Change  _ **" dn: cn={3}client,cn=schema,cn=config"**_ to  _ **" dn:
cn={5}user,cn=schema,cn=config"**_ and  _ **" cn: {3}client"**_ to  _ **" cn:
{5}user"**_. After that remove all lines from  _ **" structuralObjectClass"**_
to end.

  * At last we need to add this entry for user on LDAP. Please copy the following command and execute it on terminal.

> sudo ldapadd -x -W -D 'cn=admin,cn=config' -W -f ./user.ldif

If the output is  _ **adding new entry "cn={5}user,cn=schema,cn=config"**_
then we successfully added the entry for user. Else if you find any problem
like

adding new entry "cn={5}user,cn=schema,cn=config"  
ldap_add: Other (e.g., implementation specific) error (80)  
additional info: olcAttributeTypes: Duplicate attributeType:
"1.3.6.1.4.1.47919.2.1.1"

Then please download the attached  **" user.ldif"** file and copy it on the
"/home/" or on the current working directory. And then again nrun the
following command.

> sudo ldapadd -x -W -D 'cn=admin,cn=config' -W -f ./user.ldif

## Delete data on LDAP:

  * Please run the following command for delete any existing data:

> ldapdelete -r -D "cn=admin,dc=infoimageinc,dc=com" "dc=infoimageinc,dc=com"
> -W

 **Note:**  This will delete all data under
**[infoimageinc.com](http://infoimageinc.com)**  domain.

## Import data from ldap_dump.ldif file:

  * Please run the following command for import  _ **" ldap_dump.ldif"**_ file:

> ldapadd -x -D "cn=admin,dc=infoimageinc,dc=com" -W -f ldap_dump.ldif

## Export data from ldap as ldap_dump.ldif file:

  * Please run the following command for export  _ **" ldap_dump.ldif"**_ file:

> ldapsearch -Wx -D "cn=admin,dc=infoimageinc,dc=com" -b
> "dc=infoimageinc,dc=com" -H ldap:// -LLL > ldap_dump.ldif

## Add a feature on LDAP:

  * At first we need to create a "accessSMSTab.ldif" file. Edit the file with the following command:

> sudo nano accessSMSTab.ldif

Copy and paste the following lines.

dn: cn=accessSMSTab,cn=OfferCatalog,ou=INFOREACH-FEATURES,ou=FEATURE-DEFINIT  
 ION,dc=infoimageinc,dc=com  
cn: accessSMSTab  
description: To access offer sms tab  
l: N  
objectClass: organizationalRole  
objectClass: top  
ou: cn=OfferCatalog,ou=INFOREACH-FEATURES,ou=FEATURE-DEFINITION,dc=infoimagein  
 c,dc=com

    
    
      
    
    

  

  * Please run the following command for add the SMS feature:

> ldapadd -x -D cn=admin,dc=infoimageinc,dc=com -W -f accessSMSTab.ldif

If the output is  _ **adding new entry
"cn=accessSMSTab,cn=OfferCatalog,ou=INFOREACH-FEATURES,ou=FEATURE-
DEFINITION,dc=infoimageinc,dc=com"**_ then the ftature is added.

## Delete a feature on LDAP:

  * Please run the following command for add the SMS feature:  

ldapdelete -D "cn=admin,dc=infoimageinc,dc=com"
"cn=accessSMSTab,cn=OfferCatalog,ou=INFOREACH-FEATURES,ou=FEATURE-
DEFINITION,dc=infoimageinc,dc=com" -W
