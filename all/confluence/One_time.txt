title: One time
body: But one time payments can only be done when a bill exists. They cannot
schedule payments to future. They can't view bills either.

  * Uses AIM (advance integration module) module
  * custom amount can be more or less than min due amount, the JS on page which lets user know if they do so, but it still allows them to make payment. If user makes more than the bill balance the hosipital manually moves credit to other account balances(if not connected)- from specification document.

  * On step 2 of one time payment following warning appears "Warning: A payment has been processed for this bill to be effective on 09/04/2012 14:52:16 CDT. The payment was made in the amount of $12.33."  
\- basically this warning only appears when there is a successful(not
cancelled or failed) payment already associated with the most recent bill for
this account.

  * Expired cards email can only be triggered in one time payment flow when you add a card whose date is after 33. It will allow payment to get submitted but we will get an email saying payment was not successful  

  * if statement not available you get this message in first step of one time pay"Your statement is not available online at this time. Please contact the Patient Accounts Office at (866) 867-0178 toll-free or (319) 272-7020. Thank you."
  * From authorize logic Authorize  
com.infoimage.financial.payment.vendor.authorize.AuthorizeManager.createOneTimeTransactionRequest_AuthCapture(PayableAccount
account, AuthorizePaymentTransactionDAO tranx) throws Exception

// For one-time payment, will send the payment information and transactions in
the same service call  
// please note for one-time payment, we will not save the credit card or bank
information at the  
// third vendor ([autorize.net](http://autorize.net))

basically above means that no profile gets created in in the case of One time
flow
