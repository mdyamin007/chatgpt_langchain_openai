title: Form Builder Vendor Details
body: We are currently reviewing different vendor options to find Form Builder which
satisfy following requirements:

  1. Form Builder should be integrated with our Web Application.
  2. After creating form, it should reside on our database.
  3. Allow customize Branding.
  4. Should allow to create professional form.
  5. It's good if it allow to generate form in different types. (e.g, pdf, xhtml, etc.)
  6. Allow to implement different conditional requirements.

So far, We have come across different possible options. After analysis, I will
post some vendor name and more details about their product.

So far, I have come up with following vendors:

  1. Orbeon
  2. FormAssembly
  3. JotForm
  4. FormStack
  5. TinyMCE

  

## Orbeon

I have gone through the Orbeon form builder.

Pros:

  * Allow on-site hosting.
  * Community edition is free.
  * Able to place inside the HTML page.
  * Database can be hosted on our side.
  * Allow validation.

Cons:

  * Once you generate PDF, it is just plain pdf.
  * Also, It's complex for user to understand.
  * For validation, and conditional rules, we need to use their form runner. Means, user need to fill information in form, then we will generate PDF, and send for eSignature.

## TinyMCE

  * It is online tool, which we can keep in our HTML page, and use can design the form.

Pros:

  * Very simple, and It gives us the data in XML, from that we can generate pdf using iText XMLWorker.
  * It's tool similar we are using in JIRA.
  * We can load the form again in order to do customization.
  * It provides table, horizontal line, colors, etc.
  * Since it's all javascript, and HTML, we can extend the project as per the requirement.

Cons:

  * Do not support dropdown, date picker, etc.
  * Can not create editable PDF.

Conclusion:

All form builder have some good features. After detailed analysis, I found
that no one provide editable pdf, and which will not solve our main purpose.
