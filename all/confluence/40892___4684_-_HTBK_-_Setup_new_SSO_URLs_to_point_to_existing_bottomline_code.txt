## Goals

  * Have another page (servlet mapping) in which points to an existing servlet.

## Background and strategic fit

Since this is an existing servlet, there are no specs needed to change, just
to have another servlet mapping point to the existing servlet for login,
ssoExchange, and logout.

## Assumptions

  * The client will be passing us the same information from the original SSO URL.
  * SSO is already set up, it is just to change the URL pattern when hitting our site. 

## Requirements

#| Title| User Story| Importance| Notes  
---|---|---|---|---  
1| Add servlet mappings to existing servlet names| As a User, I would like to
SSO into a different URL| Must Have|

Changes for login, ssoExchange, and logout JSP pages  
  
2|  Add new URL to the ${CID}FILTER.java| As a User, I would like to SSO into
a different URL| Must Have| Need to include the new URLs in the Pattern
"excludeUrls" in order for the site to allow access for the new URL for
generating tokens  
  
## User interaction and design

  * The interaction should be the same as the current setup, outside from the URL in which they are trying to connect to. 

## Questions

Below is a list of questions to be addressed as a result of this requirements
document:

Question| Outcome  
---|---  
Are we creating a new SSO URL?| No. They must be already existing.  
  
## Not Doing

  * Not setting up a new SSO URL.
