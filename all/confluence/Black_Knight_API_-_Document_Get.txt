title: Black Knight API - Document Get
body:   

Endpoint|
.../api/v1/loans/${porfolioIdentifier}/${loanIdentifier}/docs/${documentIdentifier}  
---|---  
Authentication| Required  
  
  

The endpoint will either call the WrapperService to convert the AFP to a PDF,
or, if the document is already stored as PDF, pull the PDF directly from
storage.

# Response

The response is represented by the Document class, which contains three
values:

  1. DocumentContent: the Base64 representation of the PDF
  2. DocumentMimeType: always application/pdf
  3. DocumentName: the description that will be used by Black Knight to display on the UI

# Design to Consider

  
| Design| Dependency| Detail| Challenge  
---|---|---|---|---  
1| Caching the Response|  
|

Remove the need to retrieve the document every single time the user clicks on
the same Document URL. Simply return the Document Response.

| When/how to invalidate the cache.  
2| Recognizing Repeat Request| 1| If a User clicks on the same Document link
multiple times, instead of running through the logic for every single request,
have subsequent requests defer and wait for the first request to finish. Then
subsequent requests can simply return from the cache.  |

What if the first request fails?

Maybe this is not feasible.
