title: NotifyService
body: **Goal:**

Create restrictions for sending notifications. For example, we don't want to
send email from 10 AM to 10 PM.

 **Implementation:**

When creating the job, there are a parameters called **enableTimeManager,
restrictStartTime, restrictEndTime (all these three parameters are optional)
** by which we can achieve the above feature. **enableTimeManager  **parameter
tells us whether we should consider the time management feature or not. If
**enableTimeManager  **is true then we expect other two parameters (
**restrictStartTime and restrictEndTime** ) which are also optional and  which
defines the time range when we should not send notification. If we send
**enableTimeManager  **as true but did not send any time range for a
particular job then the application will take the default time range which
will be defined into property file. The default property time range should be
look like below.

 **New Parameters:**

  *  **enableTimeManager:  **Whether we want to enable time management or not.
  *  **restrictStartTime:  **If we want to manage time then what would be the start time
  *  **restrictEndTime:  **If we want to manage time then what would be the end time

 **NB: Above three properties are optional. If you did not pass those
parameters then application will behave what it did previously. If you pass
the enable time management Yes and did not provide start and end time then the
application will take the default one from property file.**

  

The **POST** request which is responsible for creating a new job looks like
below.

  

  

 **[Total days is 24 hours and You can create restrictions between a time
range when the notification will not be sent. After the given time range,
notification will be sent. ]**
