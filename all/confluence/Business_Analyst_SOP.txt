title: Business Analyst SOP
body: # Purpose:  
How to assist in setting up a new ISD client.

# This page should help as a general guide as well as table of contents of
useful information to know as an ISD Business Analyst.

## 1\. There will generally be two different types of client set ups.  
    a. The client will come in with a live date in mind and will ask that we schedule our timeline according to that live date. (Due to contracts expiring)  
    b. The client will be less strict on time and be open to different timeline proposals.  
    In either case, the goal of the business analyst will be to do analysis on whether InfoIMAGE can take on this client set up in the timeframe provided and whether or not the client's business model fits in with InfoIMAGE's business model.  
      
2\. Start with the Estatement Specification Template and go through the client
model, requirements, and specifications.

## 3\. Attend the eStatement Site Walk-Through meeting with Implementation
team. Have the Customer Personalization document ready to explain what
customizations can be made to the website colors and experience.

## 4\. Moving forward, the focus will be to keep the client meeting
deliverable dates and answering questions on the importance of the
deliverables. Some key deliverables will be:  
    a. Customer Personlization Document  
    b. Site Logos and Colors  
    c. CIF File Samples  
    d. Enrollment File Samples (Optional)  
    e. Pre-Ingestion File Samples   
    f. Estatement Specification Template (Important)  
      
5\. After confirming the business model of the client meets the business model
of InfoImage we move on to to the execution step and development. Here you
will assist implementation and the ISD developer in meeting discussions about
the:  
    a. eStatement Site  
    b. InfoTRAC Site  
    c. Pre-Ingestion  
    d. Pre-Enrollment  
    e. CIF process  
    f. Enrollment process  
    g. Undeliverable emails  
    h. Internal Paperless Report (for IS Mail Suppression)
