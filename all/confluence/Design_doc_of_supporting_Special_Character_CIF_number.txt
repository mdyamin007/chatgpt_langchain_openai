title: Design Doc of supporting Special Character CIF number
body: ## **Introduction**

Supporting CIF number which will have Special Characters such as (Space, &, #)
along with alphabets and numbers.

This doc will represent the changes in hypercube to support this.

##  **Purpose/Objective Summary**

Currently, the Special Character CIF number was not working due to not sending
encoded CIF number during API calls.

The main objective of this update is to support special Character CIF number
on the hypercube side by sending encoded CIF number during API calls where
needed.

##  **Scope**

### In-Scope

  1. Identify CIF number and primary user related API 
  2. Encode CIF number  during API call so that it will be ideally stored into database (ssoEnrollmentApi, userAccountsApiServer, userAccountsApi )
  3. Store special characters CIF number in the database
