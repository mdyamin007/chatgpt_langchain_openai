## Goals

  *  _Create a Workflow for handling incoming data and outputting valuable insights_
  *  _Be able to store significant data with minimal storage and analyze data over time_
  *  _Tailor offerings to specific FI products to help them market efficiently and effectively_
  *  _Implement Machine Learning to understand user base deeply  
_

## Background and strategic fit

 _InfoIMAGE is already entrusted with Financial Data, so this tool is to allow
us to make use of that data to allow our customers to understand their user
base better. This benefits the FI by allowing them to target individuals with
efficient advertising, and to adjust their offerings to better serve their
users._

## Assumptions

  *  _The Data to be analyzed is of many users over a monthly basis_
  *  _FIs will pay a fee for this monthly report and more for a long-range analysis_
  *  _We will keep expanding the spend classifications that we can differentiate and come up with more nuanced analysis_
  *  _We will build relationships with the customers of this product and aid their marketing with our analysis_
  *  _Potential market research at request for a price to understand the user 's affinity for a given FI offering  
_

## Requirements for Data Analytics

#| Title| User Story| Importance| Notes  
---|---|---|---|---  
1|

 _Data Cleaning for all Critical Cores  _

|  _We have code to extract data from each core and put it into a standard
form across all cores._|  Must-Have|

  *  _Code exists for Symitar. DNA is high priority_
  *  _Test data is needed_

  
2|   _Server Implementation_|    _Internal application for InfoIMAGE to apply
code to large data files and extract and crunch data without using a desktop
's computing power._|  Must-Have|

  *   _This will allow us to produce a real first offering of value that synthesizes a large amount of data_
  *  _Code exists for this as well  
Need server space  
_

  
3|  _Individual reports_|  _Take the outputs from analysis and put them into a
digestible form for marketing teams on the client side._|  Must-Have|

 _Preliminary outputs exist and can be expanded_  
  
4|   _Internal Applet for visualization_|  _An internal applet will allow
InfoIMAGE to easily create graphs and tables for the reports procedurally_  |
_Medium_|

  *   _This will make it easier to create mainstay graphs for long term analysis_
  *  _Barebones code exists for this but will need adaptation_

  
5|   _Data Storage and Long-term analysis_|    _Store data in a matrix
allowing for analysis over time_|   Must-Have|   _This gives us a next step
and inviting offer to FIs to have us analyze their data_  
6|   _Machine Learning_|    _Allow for machine learning models to be run on
data to more finely tune our model_|  Industry Standard|   _Machine learning
models have potential to better fit the user base than our intuition would
lead_  
7|   _External Applet/Data Dashboard_|    _A Standalone product that allows
customers to view their data in our visualizations and tables at their
discretion_|   Long Term/end game|  _This may be a product all its own and is
kind of a different direction but is a distinct possibility_

Question| Outcome  
---|---  
(e.g. How we make users more aware of this feature?)| Communicate the decision
reached  
  
## Not Doing

  *  _Data from different FIs will stay separate, not to be used for aggregated analysis_
  *  _Selling data to 3rd party vendors_
  *  _Selling data to other FIs_
  *  _Data will only be stored with the consent of FI_
  *  _We are not yet integrating with InfoSENSE
