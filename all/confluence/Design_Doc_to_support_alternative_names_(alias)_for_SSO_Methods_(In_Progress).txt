title: Design Doc to support alternative names (alias) for SSO Methods (In Progress)
body: ### Introduction

This design documentation is to represent the necessary information and
changes required to support different names (alias) for existing SSO methods.

### Purpose/Objective Summary

Currently, clients can only sso via existing sso methods and the methods
cannot be called with other names.

The main objective of this feature is to accept client provided sso names and
redirect them to existing sso methods like singleSignOn7, digitalInsightV2
etc. The alias name might be on the sso-keygen url params or on the request
body. This name will be extracted and matched with the predefined alias-method
map and the client will do sso via an existing method.

### Scope

#### In-Scope

  1. Get the client provided sso alias from the request url or request body. 
  2. Map the alias name to existing sso method name.
  3. Let the application go forward with existing sso business. 

### Requirements

#### Business Requirements & Use Case

ID| Title| Details  
---|---|---  
BR_01| Use alias name to do sso| Client will sso into Hypercube with an
appropriate method and they will call the method whatever they like. We will
call it "alias".  
  
#### Functional Requirements & Use Case

ID| Title| Details  
---|---|---  
FR_01| Define alias-method mapping| Define an map object in constants.js.
key=alias, value=sso method name  
FR_02| Grab the method name alias from request url| The alias name will be
provided via request url and grab and match the name with alias-method keys.
If exists then the method name will be the key's value. If not then it is not
a valid alias.  
FR_03| Grab the method name alias from request body| If the method name is not
provided via request url then it will be grabbed from the request body.  
FR_04| Preserve existing SSO key gen business| If the alias method is not
provide or not registered, then the previous sso key gen business will be
activated.  
  
#### QA/Test Requirements

ID| Title| Details

TR_01| Test alias feature for different sso methods|
