#### What is Product?

#### Product Overview

Each quarter the client will send InfoIMAGE a list of closed account numbers
list for purging within ViewStatements/ InfoDOCS. This will permanently remove
the account and statement information from InfoIMAGE's repository and clients
will no longer have access to these accounts.

#### Client's Fit

This feature allows clients to clear closed accounts' information for added
security from potential risks like data breaches, etc. It also gives clients
an option if they do not want to archive closed account numbers.

#### InfoIMAGE's Fit

This provides InfoIMAGE with a way to free up repository and risk holding onto
closed account numbers while providing clients with options on how to handle
their closed number archives.
