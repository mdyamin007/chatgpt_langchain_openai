title: Setup locally
body: # **Step 01:**

First of all, we need the code base of infoservice. As we maintain git repo
for infoservice code base, you have to clone the project from git.

Git Code Repo: <https://gitlab.infoimageinc.com/PD/infoservice>

As we maintain another repo for configuration files, you have to clone the
configuration file for infoservice.

Git Config Repo: <https://gitlab.infoimageinc.com/configuration-
management/server-configs-dev/-/blob/master/ca-infotrac-dv-01/infoservice/app-
configs/infoservice/config.properties>

As we don't have any configuration in tomcat for infoservice and we we are
using tomcat-7, you can download that one from their official website.
Infoservice uses JDK 7. So your system should have JDK-7.

Now we are ready with our weapons.

  

#  **Step 02:**  

Open your favorite IDE and open infoservice code base through that IDE. In
this doc I am using inteliji-17. First you need to open the project through
the POM file and  select **import Maven projects automatically.  **After that
you have to click couple of next button.

  

  

  

# Step 03:

Now we have to tell the IDE that where the tomcat is situated. To do so, click
the edit button of tomcat and navigate to the location where tomcat-7 is
stored. Following picture will give you a gist.

  



  

#  **Step 04:**

We are done with our setup. Now just click the run button and the application
should start and you will see the swagger page of infoservice.
