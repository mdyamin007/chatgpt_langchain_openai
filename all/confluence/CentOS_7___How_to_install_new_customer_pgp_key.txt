  4. cp .gnupg/pubring.gpg /home/keep/gpg_key ##  operator accounts are linked to the files in this folder
  5. gpg -list-keys ##  the last entry should be the newly added key
  6. email programmer(s) and DP with the new public key description from step 5 so that they are aware a new PGP was added.
