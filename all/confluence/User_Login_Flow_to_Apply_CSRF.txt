title: User Login Flow to Apply CSRF
body: We have updated the user login flow to apply the CSRF. Now user has to input
the username at the first step. See the screenshot below-

After that, server side will determine if the user should be redirected to the
secure site or not. If this user should be redirected to the secure site the
user will be taken to the next step to input password. See the screenshot-

  

As the user is redirected to the secure site the URL got changed to the
secured one. Now after putting the password user can log in only if the
username and the password are valid.

If the user is not listed for the secure site then he will be redirected to
the same step but the URL will be the general one. See below-

  

  

As you can see the user is redirected to the general Infotrac URL. Then user
can log in if the username and password is valid. User can also go back the to
previous step by clicking on the back button.

If the username or the password is not valid or there is any other issue to
log in then the user will be redirected to the step 1 with the corresponding
error message like the following-
