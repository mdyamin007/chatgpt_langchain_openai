### Database

 **USR_SESSION** : Account number as _sess_login_id._ DSO is null.  
 **USR_MAPPING** : No data.  
 **NOTIFICATION_PREFERENCE** : No data. Uses CONTACT_INFO table.

### Login Method

SSO7

### SSO (SSO7)

  * Users will hit on two different uri's (/WESCOMSSO and /MALSSO), both point to same servlet(SingleSignOn7Servlet) with same parameters (only difference is password and hash method). 
  * Only account number is needed for successful SSO, email is not mandatory.
  * Does not update email.
  * Account number will be zero-padded at the front if length is less than 10 digits. 
  * Will create login if user is new.  

### DSO

  * Hitting the DSO page shows a text " _You are currently being redirected to SELCO's eStatement page. Please click here if you have not been redirected within 30 seconds._ " 
  * The link is "[https://www.selco.org/estatement/](https://www.selco.org/estatement/)"
  * Access log does not have any hit on /login.jsp. 
  * Prism code-base does not have any dso folder, which usually holds the dso codes. 
  * Production database has dso dates, which can be inserted by backend processes. AFP, DOC and PAPERLESS processes put dso date in the USR_SESSION table. 
  * Also, USR table does not have SSN. Some records have DOB, some are not. If SLCU has DSO, then the Auth process should also exist to get the SSN and/or DOB. But SLCU does not have any Auth process. 
  *  **We can conclude that SLCU does not have DSO** **login**. 

### Leading Zero Account

  * No leading zero trimming while SSO. 
  * If account number is less than 10 digits long, it will be zero-padded at the front to make it 10 digits long. 
  * Database stores the account number with leading zero, but in the ROOT site, account numbers are shown by trimming leading zeros.

### Welcome Email

N/A

### Enrollment

N/A

### Statement Types & Archival Period

Eight types of statements are:

  * ESTMT_DOC: default, escrow, visa_gold, visa_plat, visa_duet, visa_mbs ==> 24
  * ENOTICE: enotice ==> 24
  * ETAX: etax ==> 36

### Delivery Preference

  * Paper = B, Paperless = E, New = N
  * Can't change delivery preference from ROOT/MSM site. 
  * Delivery preference can only be changed by Paperless process. 

### Notification Preference

  * Only Email is supported. No SMS support. 
  * Uses CONTACT_INFO table. No data in NOTIFICATION_PREFERENCE table.

### Paperless Configuration

Non-Selective. Can't assign different emails to different statement types.

### NP Link Type

byUSR. Uses CONTACT_INFO table.

### Menu Tabs

  *  **Statements**  
    * eStatement, Visa Gold, Visa Platinum, MBS Visa, Visa Duet, Escrow, eNotices, Tax Form.
    * Account numbers are shown by trimming leading zeros.
    * Default, Escrow and eNotices have inserts. 
    * No important(side) disclosures. 
    * If no statement is present, shows a message (showed in 1st screenshot). 
  *  **Billing Rights**  
    * Shows billing rights for monthly and visa statements. 
    * Two PDF links open in new tab: Account Statement Billing Rights, Visa Account Billing Rights. 
  *  **Contact Us**  
    * Opens in new tab. URL: <https://www.selco.org/contact-us> 
  *  **Close**  
    * Closes the tab.

> Image 3 - eTaxes, Image 4 - Billing Rights

  

### Concerns

  1. ROOT site shows the account number by trimming the leading zero(s). Currently Hypercube does not do that. 
  2. If no statement is present, shows a custom message.

  

* * *

##  **MSM**  

### Statement Search

  * Can search for an account's statements by account number only. 
  * Can search with or without leading zero(s).
  * Has statement transfer.

  * Can create/view/modify/remove other managers/users that have lower privileges.

> Image 8 - Admin Edit(1), Image 9 - Image Edit(2)

### Paperless Management

  * Shows account number, enrollment date, current delivery mode and last change date. 
  * Shows paperless history. 
  * Can't change delivery mode (Paperless to paper or vice-versa).

##  **PUI**

###  _ **Backend Processes**_

SLCU has 7 backend process:

  * Afp
  * Permission
  * Insert
  * Enotice
  * Paperless 
  * Etax
  * Doc

#### Settings

  * global.multipleStmtType=true
  * global.multipleDocType=false
  * global.enableAccountType=false
  * global.autoRegister=true
  * global.ssoKey=sl1!c2@u

####  _ **Statement types and index file name**_

  * global.ms1=default
  * global.mv1=visa_gold
  * global.mv2=visa_plat
  * global.mv3=visa_mbs
  * global.mv4=visa_duet
  * global.ms4=default
  * global.dla=enotice
  * global.dna=enotice
  * global.es1=escrow

  

###  _ **Afp Process**_

Statements that will be processed by Afp:

Flags:

  * afp.compression=true

#### Handler (data):  _ _AfpStatementData6__  

 _ **fileName**  |  **acctNum**  |  **beginDate**  |  **closingDate**  |
**numOfPages**  |  **acctName**  | ssn | appType | messageIds_

  *  **Bold**  indicates mandatory field.
  * Set sequence number from  **fileName**. Split File_Name with "_", if length == 5 take arr[3] as seqNum else take substring from arr[3] from 0 to starting of ".afp" or ".pdf". 

#### Registrar:  _ _MessageEStmtRegistrar__

  * Always creates a new account if not found. 
  * As global.autoRegister is true, creates a new  ** _USR_**  and  ** _USR_SESSION_**  record. 
  * Set DSO date in  ** _USR_SESSION_**  table. 
  * Set account number as  _sess_login_id_  in  ** _USR_SESSION_**  table. 
  * Does not create user mapping. 
  * If a record is found in the  ** _FIN_ACCOUNT_**  table, update  _acct_owner_name,_  unless the name is "MEMBER". 
  * As multipleDocType is false, data will be blindly inserted while registering statements. 
  * Image_Message is true for " **default** ", " **visa** " and " **loan** ". Therefore registerMessage method will be called for those statement types. 
  * As multipleDocType is false, email notification will be turned on. So  ** _EmailNotification.register_**  method will be called.

  

 **getFinAccount()**

  * Search account with the  **account number** : 
    * If not found: 
      * Inserts into  _ **FIN_ACCOUNT**_  with the account number, name and set the status to NA,  **no acct_type**. 
      * Create  _ **USR**_ _ _ and  _ **USR_SESSION**_  with  **account number as sess_login_id, DSO date.**  
      * Insert into  _ **USR_FIN_ACCOUNT**_  with  **acct_id**  &  **usr_id**. 
    * If found: 
      * Updates the user's  **first_name**  to account name. 
  * Insert into paperless ( _ **PAPERLESS**_ )
  *  _FIN_ACCOUNT_ **:   type -> NA, Status -> A**.
  *  _USR_FIN_ACCOUNT:  _ **ufa_status  -> active.**
  *  _PAPERLESS **:**_    **p_new_status  -> B, p_old_status -> N. **
  *  _PAPERLESS2:  _ **p_latest_status  -> B, p_old_status -> N.**

#### Mismatch with Hypercube Business:

  *  ** _sess_login_id_**   **= acctNum**  instead of  ** _!usr_id_**
  * Though  **autoRegister**  is set to true, no entry in  ** _USR_MAPPING  _**table. 
  *  **DSO**   **date**  not null.

#### Changes Needed:

  *  **Registrar  -> **
    * Use  **HypercubeEStmtRegistrar**  as the registrar for Afp process instead of  **MessageEStmtRegistrar**. 
    * In  **HypercubeEStmtRegistrar.registerMessages()**  method, add a check to  **cast data1 to AfpStatmentData6.**  

  

###  _ **Paperless Process**_

Statements that will be processed by Paperless:

Flags:

  * paperless.classPath=com.infoimage.processing.application.paperless.handler.SlcuPaperlessHandler

#### Handler (data):  _ _SlcuPaperlessHandler__  

 _ **acctNum**  |  **status**  | email_

  *  **Bold**  indicates mandatory field.
  * Only digits are allowed as account number.

#### Registrar:  _ _EnrollmentRegistrar__

  * Sets DSO date in USR_SESSION table.
  * Sets account number as sess_login_id. 
  * Puts no record in USR_MAPPING table. 

 **enroll():**

  * Search for account by account number.
  * If account not found ->
    * Creates new account and user if account is not found ->  _FIN_ACCOUNT, USR, USR_SESSION._  
    * Creates user and account mapping ->  _USR_FIN_ACCOUNT._   
  * If account is found -> 
    * Search for user and account mapping by account number. 
    * If mapping not found -> 
      * Creates new user profile ->  _USR, USR_SESSION_
    * If mapping found ->
      * Get the user data by user id. 
  * Get the admin user profile by login id as "superuser". 
  * Search and insert/updates the email address by ci id.
  * If contact_info record not found -> 
    * Creates new contact_info record ->  _CONTACT_INFO_. 
  * If contact_info record found -> 
    * Get the old email address by ci id.
    * If (old email not found and new email is provided from index file) or (old email and new email does not match) -> 
      * Sets the email from index file as ci_email_addr ->  _CONTACT_INFO._
      * Creates a new audit log record ->  _AUDIT_LOG_SLCU_.  
  * Search for paperless record by account id and statement type as "default".
    * If paperless record not found -> 
      * Insert new papaerless record ->  _PAPERLESS  _(p_old_status -> "N", p_new_status -> "B"). 
      * If "E" was sent from index file ->  _PAPERLESS  _(p_old_status -> "B", p_new_status -> "E"). 
    *  If new status was "B" and index file sends "E" (opt-out) -> 
      * Update paperless reocrd ->  _PAPERLESS  _(p_old_status -> "B", p_new_status -> "E"). 
    * If new status was "E" and index file sends "B" (opt-in) -> 
      * Update paperless reocrd ->  _PAPERLESS  _(p_old_status -> "E", p_new_status -> "B"). 
  *  _FIN_ACCOUNT:   _acct_owner_name -> "New Member", last_modified_date -> today's date.
  *  _USR_SESSION:_  sess_login_id -> acccount number, dso -> today's date.
  *  _USR_FIN_ACCOUNT:  _ufa_status -> "pre_reg", ufa_registrationdate -> today's date.
  *  _USR:_  usr_firstName -> "New Member".
  *  _CONTACT_INFO:  _ci_email_addr -> email from index file or null.
  *  _AUDIT_LOG_SLCU:_  created_by -> admin id(1), target_user -> user id, old_value -> old email, new_value -> email from index file. 
  *  _PAPERLESS:  _p_old_status -> "N/B/E", p_new_status -> "B/E".

  

  * Email is only updated through a paperless process. 
  * In process file email is not mandatory. So if null email is processed then, the existing email in the CONTACT_INFO table will be replaced by null value. 
  *  ** _sess_login_id_**   **= acctNum**  instead of  ** _!usr_id_**
  * No entry in  ** _USR_MAPPING  _**table.
  *  **DSO date**  not null.

###  _ **Doc Process**_

  * No process file is found that will be processed by DOC.  
  *  ** _sess_login_id_**   **= acctNum**  instead of  ** _!usr_id_**
  *  **DSO**   **date**  not null.

###  _ **Enotice Process**_

  * Will be done by Doc process. (Enotice process files has doc process data file format)
  * enotice.createAccount=false, no account will be created if not found.

###  _ **Etax Process**_

  * No change needed. 
  * etax.createAccount=false, no account will be created if not found.

### Permission Process

Handler: DefaultPermHandler

  1.  **acctNum** | acctType

Registrar: DefaultPermRegistrar

  1. As permission.purge is true, it deletes all records from the ACCT_ACCESS table for SLCU. 
  2. After purging, the index file will be processed.
  3. For each account number in the index file, insert into ACCT_ACCESS table with aa_min_level as 3.

  

### Email Process

  * estmt: EStmtEmailHandler5
  * enotice: SlcuEmailHandler
  * etax: ETaxEmailHandler4

  

Account created/updated by: AFP, DOC, PAPERLESS
