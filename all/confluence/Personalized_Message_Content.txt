title: Personalized Message Content
body:   

# Introduction

  

## Purpose/Objective Summary

Support dynamic content that's personalized to each statement. e.g. statement-
specific barcode/qrcode. Greeting Names  
  

  

## Rough draft for quick estimation:

  

### The overall high-level design of this are as follow:

  1. Update the InfoTRAC Feature Setup module to accommodate additional type of 'personalized barcode' and 'personalized qrcode'.
  2. Update the InfoTRAC MM Step 3 to understand the personalized-barcode/qrcode types and prompt users for textual content with variable specifications:
    1. E.g. {barcode-number}
    2. E.g. [http://www.somefi.com/payment?user_id={uid}&referral=stmtQrCode](http://www.somefi.com/payment?user_id={uid}&referral=stmtQrCode)
    3. InfoTRAC would save the textual content only, and use it as template for actual content producing in the MMService below
  3. Produce a MMService that produce the dynamic content on run-time
    1. GET request on infoservice/mm/content/{campaign_id}/{target_group_id}/{message_area_id}?vars={json_string_with_variable_values}
    2. Upon each request, use the content provided via [#2](https://i3dev.easyredmine.com/issues/2 "Bug: test notif \(Closed\)") above, fill in the values as provided during this WebService call, and return the actual barcode/qrcode image
    3. Modify the Print Process code to accommodate the updated index-file spec, so that it would call the MMService above to fetch a dynamic image instead of using some static image within the currently packaged zip file.

  

### Assumption:

  1. Print side DFA can handle Message-Areas to be overlapping to each other. This would make the content design more flexible and easier to maintain. If not, we can carve out the banner into pieces in worst case scenario.
  2. Print side processing can make HTTP calls based on the data-source values, subsequently fetch/store/use the image returned. If it's perl/shell script, should be fine, but it'd be unknown if it's DFA.

  

### Estimate:

  1. For the Design #1-#3, it would take roughly 4 weeks of dev work
  2. For the Design #4, need your help to get estimate from Peter/Terrence. I had a brief chat with Tien about it and she throw some rough range of 2-6 weeks depends on complexity.
  3. We should account for ~1-2 weeks of integration testing effort.

  

## Scope

 **TODO: (Required)**  List out the itemized features of what's inside/outside
of the scope of current project/phase  
  

  

### In-Scope

  1. Feature #1
  2. Feature #2
  3. ...

  

### Out-of-Scope

  1. Feature #3
  2. Feature #4
  3. ...

  

## Assumptions

 **TODO: (If Applicable)**  List out assumptions made during this design.  
 **IMPORTANT:**  All assumptions need to be confirmed with corresponding
stake-holder during design review. Assumptions would likely become
Dependencies upon confirmation/design-review

  1. e.g. This tool is meant to be used by internal people only, hence it will only support FF/Chrome. No IE supported needed.

  

## Dependencies

 **TODO: (If Applicable)**  List out all dependency component/service/library
needed for this design

  1. e.g. jQuery Library v1.9.2 or above
  2. e.g. PC need to be responsible for entering XXX values into YYY input file

  

# Requirements

  

## Business Requirements & Use
Cases[](https://i3dev.easyredmine.com/projects/msgmgr/wiki/Personalized_Message_Content#Business-
Requirements-amp-Use-Cases)

 **TODO:**   **(Required)**  List out all needs/requirement from business/end-
user perspective. Assign an ID for each requirement/use-case item for easier
reference in future

ID| Title| Details| ScreenMock| Importance  
---|---|---|---|---  
BRQ-01| Generic Search box| (example)  
 **Requirement:**  Instead of showing a drop-down to ask user to choose what
attribute to search against,  
just have a simple search box that will search against all potential
attributes like name/email/address/phone.  
 **Use Case:**  enter "ben" into search box, search results returned should
include both record of "Ben
[Chan/bchan@infoimage.com](mailto:Chan/bchan@infoimage.com)" as well as "Jim
[Wong/jwong@bigben.com](mailto:Wong/jwong@bigben.com)"| <attach file>| one of

## Functional Requirements & Use Cases

 **TODO:**   **(Required)**  List out all needs/requirement from
engineering/functional perspective. Associate them with an ID for easier
reference

ID| Title| Details| Bus. Req. Ref.| Importance  
---|---|---|---|---  
FRQ-01| Generic Search by Sphinx| (example)  
 **Requirement:**  Instead of constructing the SQL statements for search,
utilize Sphinx to help build the index and support such generic search.  
 **Use Case:**  enter "ben" into search box, search results returned should
include both record of "Ben
[Chan/bchan@infoimage.com](mailto:Chan/bchan@infoimage.com)" as well as "Jim
[Wong/jwong@bigben.com](mailto:Wong/jwong@bigben.com)"| <optional>| one of

response time as well as validation search results| one of following:
