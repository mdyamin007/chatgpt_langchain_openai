title: SFTP Scanner - Prod Deployment and Rollout
body:   

## A. Production Deployment and Setup

  
  

### a) QA and Prod (Linux Boxes) Server Setup

  1. Install JDK 1.6 Update 39, Mule-ESB V3.3.2 and MySql 5.5 [Current status: Done]
  2. Java/JDK Configuration setup - define & set configurations like JAVA CLASSPATH and BIN Path. Also, setup MULE Home Path and MySQL Home Path [Current status: Done]
  3. MySQL DB Schema - Create schema for the Mule-ESB transaction tables and PUI Application Schema DB tables [Current status: Done]  
(Note: PUI Scanner applciation uses Oracle based DB schema. In future, Mule-
ESB can repoint to Oracle db schema or it can cpontinue to work with MySQL DB.  
In case of OracleDB repoint, Mule-ESB SFTP scanner may require minor code
changes in order to support Oracle DB)

  4. GNU PG installation and configuration for data file encrypt/decrypt
  5. FTP Server user account: Create ftp users for the source FTP servers so that Mule ESB Service can access the source SFTP Servers with root level (read-only) access [Current status: Done]
  6. Email Server user account: Create Email Id for the the Mule ESB so that Mule Service can send the email notification for the internal/external users.  
[Current status: Done]

  
  

### b) Test Run in QA/Test Env

  1. Peform testing in QA/Test Env - at least 3 rounds of testing required in the QA Env
  2. Review the QA test results and performance

  
  

### c) Depoy to Prod QA Env

  1. Peform dry-testing in Prod Env - at least 2 rounds of testing required in the Prod Env in order to validate the env setup
  2. Oracle DB schema - check the Oracle DB Tables and Sequences for the auto_increment ID values.  
It may require a post-insert trigger to populate the ID sequence value into
the PK field(e.g. Incoming-Table.ID Primary key)

  
  

## B. Transition from PUI Scanner to MuleESB Scanner

  1. Deploy & keep running Mule-ESB Scanner service in Linux QA env for 4-weeks in order to capture the incoming file logs in the MySQL DB Table
  2. Compare the incoming-file logs and Email logs against the existing PUI DB Table and Email in order to validate the missing files and incoming-files results.
  3. Identify and fix the issues in QA, if any reported.
  4. Deploy updated version into QA Env and perform 1-2 days testing.
  5. Deploy yhe latest vesion into the Mule Prod Server and run the service parallel dry-run for at least a week.
  6. review the results similar to the QA Test results and findings.
  7. In case, no issues reported during Prod dry-run, the service is fit for the production rollout.
  8. Discuss the PUI Job schedule (Windows Job task) with the PUI Team to disable the job and enable Mule-ESB Scanner job in Prod.  
The Mule-ESB Scanner will start processing the files from source SFTP Server
to the target BU Server after a defined cut-off date.  
Also, discuss the rollback strategy by enabling the original PUI Scanner job
in order to avoid any business impact.

  9. Setup meeting with the PUI Team to review & finalize the transition plan.

  
  

## C. Production Rollout plan

  
  

### Outstanding Task for DEV/QA/Test environment.

  1. Validation of files (File size, CRC32/MD5 values and Emails) processed successfully.
  2. Create new column and sequence generation trigger on DEV/QA Oracle database
  3. Dipti to provide the additional test cases for validating the schema change
  4. Complete the hook from Mule to trigger the PUI Handler for downstream processing [Not planned under Phase-1]
  5. Dipti to hook up TEST CID to DEV env to test out the [#4](https://i3dev.easyredmine.com/issues/4 "Bug: test \(Closed\)") above

  
  

### Production rollout on a single FTP server.

  1. identify one SFTP Server where minimum number CID Accounts are active in order to avoid any go-live impact.
  2. DP need to be informed about this rollout, keep close monitoring
  3. No PUI process triggering is expected on this phase of rollout.
  4. Keep monitoring the production traffic
  5. Hook up Nagios to monitor Mule servers.
  6. Rollback Procedure - Enable (turn-on) the original PUI/FTP Scanner Process and disable (turn-off) the Mule SFTP Service.
