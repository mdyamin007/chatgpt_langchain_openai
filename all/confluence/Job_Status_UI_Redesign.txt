## User interaction and design

Job Status

  

  1. Get rid of  icons and just make it 1 icon or word. Like "Additional Job Details". Currently, all three icons bring you to the same table. No need to have all three.  
  
  

  2. Filter by status should be a color and a label at the top of the page; not a drop down.   
  
  
  

  3. Make colored circles into actual words colored by current circle color  
  
  
  

  4. Expand button should be on the left and colored statuses should be on the right.  
  
  
  

  5. Currently, 2 icons under job details display with Nearly identical information. Only difference is camera image. Need to merge.  
  
  
  
  
  

  6. Add a label for this column  

  7.  **Tax Jobs for approval should stand out (red highlight) and also have a prompt when approving, disapproving or deleting.  
  
  
  
**

  8. Date picker at the top of the page to narrow results.   
  
  
  
  
  
  

  9. Allow user to export the date range results.,   
  
  
  
  

  10. Ability to view the insert that was included in a specific piece  
  
  
  

  11. Allow Columns to be sorted Ascending and Descending  
  
  
  

  12. Resize header columns to all be 1 line.   
  
  
  

  13. Allow user to resize columns and keep the resized dimensions for that users.   
  
  
  

  14. Update search to be universal and grouped. Substitute below categories for fields such as "Name" "Address" "Account Number" etc.   
  
Update Search text in search bar on main page to reflect universal search

## E-statement Analysis:

1\. Job approved/disapproved/released/rejected by the user, and user detail
need to be displayed

 **This will be a "hover" to display piece of information gated behind an "i"
icon. Screen included below. **

 ****

 ****

2\. Approval/disapproval/delete pop-up needs a comment field

  

  

USE SCREENSHOT ABOVE

USE SCREENSHOT ABOVE

3. New icons need to be provided for "Release", and "Disapprove" ("Approve" and "Reject" icons are already provided)

4\. How the UI will be shown when there is no job between the date range

5\. Table for clickable "Number of files" link has not shown

  

6\. Missing the "Proofing Sample" section on the job details page?

Use the same table layout as the job details, just with 2 columns

  

7\. Do we need to change the search box position as the search will be carried
out on the data from the bottom table only?

I thought the search was going to search the entire job, which means
everything in the first table, including ther second table.

8\. Need Omni search exact match filter option

Add a button next to "Search All" that says "Exact Search"

9\. Need inserts columns for each individual (paper) jobs in Job Details,
Delivery table  & Geo-delivery table as already discussed before.

[Anil] : Show insert name both for paper and etab as new column.

Use these indicators for the inserts

10\. Allow users to resize columns. Must this feature persist event after
logout and re-login?

[Anil]: We should not worry about persisting this. No need to persist.

11\. Job Details page for Ejobs not provided.

Use print job details page layout and change verbage where needed

12\. will the insert icon in job detail page be clickable? what will be
displayed after it is clicked? UI needed.

Will be the same as the camera image pop up. Use this pop up as a guide to
show insert image and detail.
