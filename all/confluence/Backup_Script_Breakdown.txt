title: Backup Script Breakdown
body: ## **Overview**

It is a bash script that takes incremental backup from one server and saves
the backup into another server.

##  **How it works?**

The script watches the source directory by a package called **inotify-tools.
**The script uses **inotifywait** feature of this package, **inotifywait**
efficiently waits for changes to files using Linux's  _
**[inotify](https://linux.die.net/man/7/inotify)(7)**_ interface. It is
suitable for waiting for changes to files from shell scripts.

So when **inotifywait  **detects any modification (as this script uses
**modify** event ) on source directory, it calls backup method which is
nothing but a function which takes backup and transfer those data to the
destination server via **rsync.**  

##  **The Backup Script:**

bashBackup Script

  

In the script, you have to modify some variables according to your
specification:

 **DEST_SERVER** = The remote server where the backup files will be stored.

 **SSH_USER** = A SSH_USER's username of the DEST_SERVER

 **SSH_USER_PWD** = Passowrd of the SSH_USER

 **SOURCE_DIR** = From which directory our script will take backup from.

 **BACKUP_DIR** = Where our script will save backup data. It is a remote
directory.

 **BACKUP_PATH** = Full path of the backup directory.

  

Also  you can see, we have used many flags in the script. Here is the business
of those flags:
