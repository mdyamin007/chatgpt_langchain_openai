## Goals

  * Provide a way for clients to replace previously posted accounts with corrected documents similar to corrected eTax forms
  * FCBT requested this specifically for their applications, but can potentially setup as global request

## Background and strategic fit

While FCBT is requesting this specifically for their own setups/applications,
InfoIMAGE can benefit through incorporating this globally.

## Assumptions

  * For FCBT, it would only apply to following applications:

\- LIQ Simple Bills (currently live)

\- LIQ Simple Statements (currently live)

\- LIQ Complex Bills (live Nov 2020)

\- LIQ Complex Statements (live Nov 2020)

  * No multiple documents linked an account number (scenarios where one account number has more than one tax forms for the same year, cannot replace the corrected tax form since cannot determine what form is replaced)
  * No ISD involvement needed besides support for IS/DP as they are just posting a new set of documents.

## Requirements

#| Title| User Story| Importance| Notes  
---|---|---|---|---  
1| Form Type, Account Number, Cycle Date| The requirement is to help identity
replacements for corrected documents.|  
|

  * In current process for corrected forms for taxes, we require tax form type, account name, and tax year. We could do the same for non-tax documents using form type, account number, etc.

  
2| Corrected Documents re-posted electronically and re-mailed| This is to
provide accuracy for the corrected documents both physically and online.|  
|

  * Requested by FCBT
