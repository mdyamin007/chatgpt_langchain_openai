title: Migrate IP filter from Windows IIS to Apache Server
body: During tomcat migration, when you add the IP filtering to the admin site, you
might run into cases that the IP filtering is also using the subnet. When it's
255.255.255.0, it's easy. You just add the filtering up to the 3rd set and
leave the 4th empty. However, when you have some other odd combination like
255.255.255.240 like RABO has, you will be require to add in some other format
instead. (You can ref from the URL
"<http://www.aelius.com/njh/subnet_sheet.html>").  
I.E. from RABO  
From IIS: 63.202.159.1(255.255.255.128)  
Equivalent on Apache: 63.202.159.1/25

Another I.E. from RABO  
From IIS: 64.52.54.224(240)  
Equivalent on Apache: 63.202.159.1/28

Please ensure that you follow with the instruction for the proper IP
filtering.
