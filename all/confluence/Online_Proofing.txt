title: Online Proofing
body: Infotrac site has tab called online proofing where we should samples of
cycles. Proofing is a process of showing one single afp or pdf file before
printing of actual production cycle. Proofing sample will show up documents of
few accounts which customer can view and provide approval for actual printing.

  

  

 _ **How to post proofing files?**_

We have to develop script file on processing-ui machines. This script file
will mention details about cid and file location to process as mentioned
below. Once we post a job, we can see job is visible on pui ui.

  

Sample content of  script file

call exec.bat proofing action:exec orgName:bfcu userName:system mode:test
<file://10.8.9.155/Input/I3/process-
files/bfcu/proofing_index_me1104_12052019091117.txt>
