### App Server Setup

  * Resin/Ubuntu Setup Procedures
  *   *   *   * 

  
  

### SSL Certificate related

### Environment Setup w/ Offshore Team

  *   *   *   * Access from external network
    * SVN
      * The specific port 422 is open for DSi team specifically (IP = 103.4.147.138) for ease of code check-in/merges  

            
                        nohup socat TCP-LISTEN:422,fork TCP:pd-tools.infoimage.com:22 &

    * redmine: [develop.infoimage.com](http://develop.infoimage.com) and [track.infoimage.com](http://track.infoimage.com)
      * The following domain names are proxy routed to our internal redmine, only enabled for Corporate Wifi and DSi team (IP = 103.4.147.138)
      * [https://develop.infoimageinc.com](https://develop.infoimageinc.com/)
      * [https://track.infoimageinc.com](https://track.infoimageinc.com/)

  

## Databases

  

### Database Scrumbling

  * Scrambling script is available in SVN: svn+<ssh://pd-tools.infoimage.com/srv/svn/utils/dbscripts>
  * Columns need to be scrambled:

### Database Migration from Oracle -> MySQL

  *   *   * 

  
  

### NoSQL Databases

  *   * 

## Local Environment Preparation

  * 

  

## Local Oracle setup

  * Download and install XE from <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/database-technologies/express-edition/downloads/index.html>
  * Open command prompt as Administrator.
  * run sqlplus / as sysdba
  * login with system and the password you chose
  * a tablespace called I3DATA

    
    
    create tablespace 
       I3DATA
    datafile   
      '<ORACLEXE_HOME>/app/oracle/oradata/XE/I3DATA.DBF'
    size 500M
    uniform size 10M;

  * ALTER DATABASE DATAFILE '<ORACLEXE_HOME>/app/oracle/oradata/XE/I3DATA.DBF' AUTOEXTEND ON;
  * Import the dump.

## Environment & Databases Separations

  

### Current environment setup (as of 2013-08-09)

  
  

  

### Action Items from 2013-08-09

  1. Create NEW set of Pre-Prod application/database instances under the Production (.9) subnet for eStmt pre-production runs.
    * Reason being the pre-prod run on paper side are done within the production database (license limitation). Having the pre-prod of eStmt run within the same (.9) subnet will relief the limitation of application/databases access issues.
    * Since it will be separate instances then production, even within (.9) subnet, data records are separated.
  2. Create NEW Paper-processing database for Parallel runs under the Stage (.8) subnet.
    * Utilize a Papyrus dev license so that new instance could be created without additional cost
    * Once the paper-proc database within (.8) subnet, accessing paper-side data from eStmt/PUI process/InfoTRAC no longer need to go through the proxy services. This would eliminate issues that only surface in Production/Stage environments.
  3. Create NEW DataTRAC clone for Stage environment, in addition to the Production DataTRAC and DataTRAC_IS database & UI.
    * This would be used to support parallel runs to ensure test runs are isolated from production DataTRAC data.
