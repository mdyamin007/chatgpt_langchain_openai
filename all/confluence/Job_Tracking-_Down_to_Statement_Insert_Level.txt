## How EOC Flag and grouping should be interpreted?

Here are the rules that Print team (Peter & Terrence) have agreed upon around
the interpretation of EOC flag.  
QA need to rely on this rule set to validate any client/application that will
have the Full-Detail Tracking turned on.

  1. EOC flag (character 332-334 in data file) is either:
    1. populated with "0" or "1" OR
    2. carry blank value
  2. The two scenario listed above would NEVER mixed with each other within any give entire set of data files within a single PROC_ID job.
    1. Meaning we will NEVER get a file that have mixed values of "0", "1", " " (i.e. blank) within a full set of data files within a single PROC_ID.
  3. When EOC flag is populated with "0" or "1", it means the job is utilizing grouping logic, we will be using the group_image_count (335-339) to fetch corresponding PDF
  4. When EOC flag is populated with blank spaces, it means the job is NOT utilizing grouping logic, we will be using the ac_image (54-58) to fetch corresponding PDF.

Putting in an example, following kind of file would  **NOT**  happen:

file name| line number| account number| start page| stmt image count| group
image count| eoc
