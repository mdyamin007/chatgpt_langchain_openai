title: Parallel Process (wip)
body: Once our projects are approved by the client on pilot and code has been moved
over and tested on stage, then we go through this internal process among other
necessary departments to test everything together (on stage) before releasing
code to production. On Team Support, a Master Parallel ticket will be created
and sub-tickets for Print and Electronic will also be created and assigned to
the respective developers. As ISD, we should never have to deal with the
Master Parallel, only the Electronic parallel ticket.

## Step-by-step guide

Upon opening the Electronic ticket, you should see a table in comment 1:

  

For ISD, the parallel process is usually comprised of three steps:

  1. Prep
    1. Fill in the table with respect to any updates made (i.e. If there is a new resource file uploaded, add the resource filename next to the 'Resource files' box).
    2. Pass the ticket along and change the following information:

Status: ISD_Prep -> ISD_PREP_DONE  
Assignee: Set to AC/IM person  
Group: Set to AC/Implementation (Note: Each AC has their own group, for
example Daphne_AC, Joye_AC, etc).

  

  2. Verification
    1. Verify necessary updates on stage

    2. Pass the ticket along and change the following:
    3.   

Status: ISD_Verifying -> Set to either:

      * ISD_Pass: If everything looks good. 
      * ISD_Fail: If something is incorrect or missing (i.e. Index file has missing account numbers)

Assignee: Set to AC/IM person  
Group: Set to AC/Implementation

  

  3. Release
