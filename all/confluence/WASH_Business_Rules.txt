# User Base

* * *

WASH have two different user bases: JackHenry and Bottomline.

The Auth File only provides for JackHenry users. All Bottomline users are
created via SSO. Since the Auth File is a full file, there is a filtering
logic that will filter out all records whose UFA's source is SSO (must be
created by Bottomline SSO). The filtering logic will also exclude users that
have entries in the USR_TREE table. This is because only Bottomline users
would have primary and subusers. All JackHenry users are singular users with
no subusers.
