 **User-Account Relation**|

1 User - 1 Account  
  
### Database

 **USR_SESSION** : Account number as SESS_LOGIN_ID. DSO gets value. Needs
migration.  
 **USR_MAPPING** : No data in USR_MAPPING. Needs migration  
 **NOTIFICATION_PREFERENCE** : Uses NP table. Previously CI was used. Only
Production db seems to get migrated (NP).

### Login Method

From web.xml, 3 login method found (DI, BL and Q2).

  * BottomLineSSO LoginServlet is absent in the infoimage jar.
  * Q2 url is not excluded in the filter class.
  * Only DI is usable. 

### SSO (DI)

  * Only account number (user_fi_number) is needed for successful SSO.
  * Email is not updated through SSO. 
  * Always creates a new account if not found. 
  * Sets account number as sess_login_id.
  * Sets date in DSO. 

### DSO

N/A

###  **Leading Zero Account**

  * Does not use leading zero accounts.
  * Leading zero accounts can SSO.
  * Does not trim leading zero(s).

### Welcome Email

Welcome email feature exists but the code to send welcome email is blocked
(commented-out).

###  **Enrollment**

Two Steps:

  1. Disclosures & Delivery Preference
  2. PDF Verification

In both step, Reconciliation and Agreement links are shown above footer.

### Enrollment Logic:

  * Enrollment triggers if P_LATEST_STATUS got the value 'B' in PAPERLESS2 table. 
  * Does not check SSO null in the USR_SESSION table. 
  * If enrollment triggers, opt-out page is shown.

### Statement Types & Archival Period

Type| Description| Archival  
---|---|---  
Default| Member| 36  
Heloc| Home Equity| 36  
Visa| Visa Credit Card| 36  
Mortgage| Mortgage| 36  
Enotice| eNotice| 4  
Etax| eTax| 36  
  
### Delivery Preference

  * Paper = B, Paperless = E, New = N
  * Going paper triggers enrollment. 
  * Delivery preference uses different verbiage. Paperless: Currently enrolled in eStatements and Paper: Cancel eStatements.
  * InfoSERVICE API is called after updating the delivery preference. 

### Notification Preference

  * Only Email is supported. No SMS. 
  * Uses NOTIFICATION_PREFERENCE table. 
  * Previously CONTACT_INFO table was used (before 2017-08). Production db got a NP migration. Staging, Pilot and Dev db does not. 

### Paperless Configuration

Non-Selective. Can't assign different emails for different statement types.

### NP Link Type

byUFA. Both USR_ID and ACCT_ID are saved in the NP table.

### Menu Tabs

  1. eStatements
  2. eNotices
  3. eTax
  4. Check
  5. Profile

  * No account number is shown.
  * Tabs are shown always. (whether the tab has statement or not).
  * Different disclosures on every tab (without Profile).
  * In eStatements and eNotices tab, view/not-view status is shown. 
  * In Profile tab, Reconciliation and Agreement links are displayed above footer.

### Concerns about ROOT

  1. Welcome email feature exists but the code to send welcome email is blocked (commented-out).
  2. Going paper does not log out the user. Instead shows an "opt-out" page in the statement tab. This page contains the disclosure verbiage and two input fields for email and email confirmation. 
  3. InfoSERVICE API is called after updating delivery preference. 
  4. This client is shifted from CONTACT_INFO to NOTIFICATION_PREFERENCE table. But migration is only done in Production database.

## MSM

### Account Management

  1. Can search for an account by account number and email address. 
  2. Shows Member Name (User name), Account Number, Account Name, Delivery Preference, Notification Options, Email Address, Paperless History and Statements. 
  3. Can change email address and delivery preferences. 

### Email Proofing

  1. Email notification templates:
    1. Member (default)
    2. Home Equity (heloc)
    3. Visa Credit Card (visa)
    4. Mortgage (mortgage)
    5. eNotices (enotice)
    6. eTax (etax) 
    7. Welcome
  2. Keywords: 
    1.  **$** **sdv_txt_userName**  
    2.  **$sdv_txt_eNoticeList**  
    3.  **$sdv_txt_eTaxList**  

Can upload email content from a file.

### Upload Inserts

Inserts available for: Member (default), Home Equity (heloc), Visa Credit Card
(visa) and Mortgage (mortgage).

### Marketing Promo Email

### Reports

  1. Latest Stats: not available in InfoTRAC 
  2. User Login Activity
  3. AI Login Activity
  4. AI User Activity
  5. Email Address Collection
  6. Paperless

### Administration

  1. Can change admin user's credentials. 
  2. Can create/view/modify/remove other users that have lower privileges.

### eStatment Account Creation

  1. Creates a new eStatement account and attaches a new user to the account.
  2. Saves leading zero account number without leading zero(s). USR_SESSION table saves account number as SESS_LOGIN_ID with leading zero(s). 

### Exit

Exits the MSM site with a confirmation page.

  

  

### Concerns about MSM

  1. It is not possible to create a new account with leading zero(s) from MSM site. It trims the leading zero(s) and saves in the FIN_ACCOUNT table. But in the USR_SESSION table, it saves the account number with leading zero(s) as sess_login_id. Also, from the ROOT site, account creation with leading zero is possible. 
  2. In Email Proofing, user can upload email content from a file. This feature is not in InfoTRAC.

---|---|---|---|---  
 **SSO**|  User Enrollment logic|

Goes through enrollment based on paperless status (if in paper).

|  120 complete Supported  121 incomplete Not Supported |

In Hypercube, a user goes through enrollment if he/she never logged in via
SSO. It does not depend on the account's paperless status.

 **Client will use default (sso date based) enrollment logic. Migration needed
to put sso date in USR_SESSION table.**  
  
Enrollment Step 1| E statement Disclosure & Email Update.|  122 complete

steps. If this client will move to Hypercube, Email Update will be done in
enrollment step 3.

Slightly different from Hypercube business. i.e. in Hypercube, if Delivery P
reference changes to paper, user will just be logged out with an confirmation
modal. **It  will not trigger enrollment automatically**.

N.B - Not an issue  
  
Calls a pathway API (<http://infoservice-
common.infoimageinc.com/api/v1/account>) to update delivery preference with
the following parameters:

org_id, acct_number, acct_name, acct_status, paperless_status and
email_address.

|  
|  **InfoSERVICE should handle the delivery preference update.**  
Additional Links and Different verbiage|

Delivery type selection radio buttons use different verbiage.

Paperless radio button verbiage: Currently enrolled in eStatements.

Paper radio button verbiage: Cancel eStatements.

|  41 complete Supported  42 incomplete Not Supported |

Currently Hypercube uses those verbiages like this,

Paperless: **Electronic** and Paper: **Paper**.

Hypercube is not configured to change those verbiages.
