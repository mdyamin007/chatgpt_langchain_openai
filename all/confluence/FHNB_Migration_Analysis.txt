  * ####  diSSO:

    *  **Mandatory fields:** password, user_fi_number, email, gmt, timeout
    * Leading zeros are removed from cif.
    * Search user by cif. If no user is available then throws user_not_found error.
    * If user exists then it searches the user profile in usr_session. If data doesn't exist in the usr_session table then it creates usr_session data for that user. Otherwise, if sess_active_status is "invalid" then it throws an error called errorMessage_DISABLED_USER. If sess_active_status is "inactive" then it sets sess_active_status as active.
    * Emails are updated from sso file if the user has less than two emails in the NP table. Otherwise, email is not updated from sso file.

###  **DSO:**

  * Only the signing in and forget password feature is available.
  * For first time login it redirects to a page called token_recovery. There ar two options there:

             1. I'm on a public computer. Please log me in without adding secure, unique device identifier.

             2. Please log me in and add this secure, unique device identifier on my computer.

             If 2nd option is selected then it creates and stores the token into the usr_token table for that computer. And it doesn't redirect to the token recovery page in future login from that computer.

so no migration is needed.

 **Enrollment(SSO)**

|  User enrollment|

The user goes through enrollment based on the following 3 conditions.

  1. If the user never logged in via SSO and DSO
  2. If the user logged in via DSO but not SSO
  3. If the user never logged in via DSO but SSO with status="pending" (Admin user creation inserts sso date, **CHECK WHY; CHECK THE REPORTS; CHECK IF WE REMOVE SSO DATE FROM HYPERCUBE DOES ANYTHING AFFECT** )  
  
DSO users can do SSO. After SSO, sess_login_id remains email.  
  
SSO users can't do DSO as their sess_login_id is "!"usr_id.
