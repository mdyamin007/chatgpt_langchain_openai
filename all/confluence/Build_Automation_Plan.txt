title: Build Automation Plan
body:   

## **Checklist and milestones**

Target| Status  
---|---  
 **Mavenizing**  all the wars. I war per application eg.Processing.war,
Payebill.war. That means one build script per application.| PUI done  
Payebill??  
 **PUI**  \- Create a deployable Processing war with all the relative paths
fixed.| deployable part ready and working,  
all paths haven't been fixed  
build script ready need to be cleaned up do it as a loop  
 **Payebill**  
Templatizing the login.jsp file for all the 3 clients using a templating
engine. We will name this new file a login_new.jsp we want to keep old one
just for fall back.  
This means moving the included jsps like header,.jsp, define.jsp etc into java
( hoping to get this part done in 2 weeks timeframe)|  
  
 **Build Automation**  
1) Make sure the pom.xml of all projects are modified so that the war which is
created is prefixed by some name for each application since all applications
would not be on the same version.  
2) Should we have a seperate folder for each of the applications containing
projects it needs and also corresponding build script| 1) Not done  
2) Done  
Common  **third party libs**  should be moved to central place rather than
being part of every war|  
  
  
  
  

##  **Tagging**

We tag the project when we do a stable build. Tagging happens at certain
milestones.  
  

  

##  **Branching strategy**

  * Evaluate Current branch
    * Can we take the customer facing JSP for all clients and make it the baseline for all cid jsps in SVN???
  * We need to have SVN set up on new server. Ben might be setting it up.
  * Move all files from CVS production to SVN trunk
  * Create "Current" Branch from trunk. Do we need a "Support" Branch > mainly for production support team
  * We need a process to make sure all jsps are always checked in.

  
  

## PSF files need to be created for eclipse workspace set up

How to use psf file to set up workspace

  * We need a launch configuration directory probably in a repository of it's own which will contain the psf files
  * How many psf files do we need?
  * While creating psf file we need to make sure that pom.xml and classpath file per project is checked into to SVN

 **PSF**.|  **Development Environment**.|  **Production Environment**.  
---|---|---  
Master PSF|  
|  
  
Infotrac PSF|  
|  
  
Processing PSF|

Estatement PSF|

Payebill PSF|
