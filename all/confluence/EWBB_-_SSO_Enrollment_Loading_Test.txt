title: EWBB - SSO Enrollment Loading Test
body: ## **Objective**

To measure the time it takes to load the  **Enrollment**   **Step 3 out of 3**
page during SSO Enrollment for loading fully 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600,
700, 800, 900, and 1000 accounts.

##  **Assumption**

We are not paginating for any number of accounts. When testing for 600
accounts, the 600 accounts will be loaded immediately. This test is to help
the client determine the threshold at which pagination should happen.

##  **Test Steps**

  1. Use DI SSO with usr_fi_number 999999999\. You do not need to fill out the account_number or type
    1. 

###  **Test the load time to change between pages for each of the # of entries
per page (100, 200, 300, etc.)**

  1. Start on page 2 and click  **Previous** to move to page 1 (this is because when we are testing 600+ accounts, only page 1 would have the correct amount)
  2.   3.   4. We want to measure the average time it takes for the highlight on square 2 to move to square 1. (Measure to two decimal places in seconds if possible)

###  **Test the load time when the initial pageLength value is 100, 200, 300,
etc.**

  1. On Pilot PUI, change the pageLength value to the number that you are testing. Currently, it is set to 100. 
    1. go to .../tomcat-default/i3webapps/ewbb/ROOT/enroll/ssoOptoutAll.jsp (to edit, you will need to use sudo)
    2.   2. SSO in, and go through the enrollment steps until Step 3 out of 3
    1.   3. We want to measure the average time it takes for the page to fully load all the accounts for each given pageLength. (Measure to two decimal places in seconds if possible)
    1. 

  

If you accidentally finish the enrollment step, run this query:

update usr_session set sso = null where usr_id = '29130716';

  

##  **Development**

  1. Add a loading verbiage while the accounts are loading on Step 3 of 3 so that the customer won't think there are nothing displayed
    1.   2. Enable the Submit button  **ONLY** when the user has viewed all accounts (gone through all the pages) at least once.
