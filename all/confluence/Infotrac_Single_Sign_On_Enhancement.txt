## Goals

  * The objective of this enhancement is to support clients with different identity provider services for Infotrac Single Sign On (SSO) facility through SAML and Microsoft Active Directory Federation Service.

## Background and strategic fit

Infotrac SSO is built based on Microsoft ADFS and SAML authorization standards
with Infoauth Service. The current infrastructure is capable of serving the
SSO facility for clients with Microsoft ADFS as the identity provider service.
However, many clients can have different identity providers other than
Microsoft ADFS, such as Keycloak, Okta, CASS etc. Therefore the functionality
to support different identity providers is required to serve SSO functionality
to those clients. To meet the objective some research and testing have been
done. To fulfill the requirement Infoimage MS ADFS configuration needs some
changes and Infoauth Service may require additional development. Also to
replicate the whole workflow, proper testing through a SAML-based IDP must be
done internally.

## Current Workflow

## New Workflow

## Analysis

## Assumptions

  * Clients use any SAML based Identity Provider service like MS ADFS, Keycloak, Okta, etc
  * Clients' IDP will provide metadata file for IDP configuration in XML format.
  * Clients' IDP will support metadata files for SP configuration in XML format.
  * Clients' IDP will be able to provide the claims required for Infotrac SSO
  * Clients' have the ability to configure the SP as the relying party trust from their end.

Development:

 **Microsoft ADFS:  **

  * Updating MS ADFS to enable SAML based IDP support
  * Setting up claim provider trust configuration.
  * Documenting ADFS configuration procedure for non-ADFS based IDP.
  * Documenting technical guidelines for Service Provider / Relying Party Trust configuration for SAML-based IDP.

 **Infoauth Service** :

  * Feature inclusion to support generic SAML IDP.
  * Updating Spring Security SAML for non - ADFS based SSO support.
  * Updating service layer for handling claims sent by non - ADFS based IDP. 

 **Test Plan:**

  * Setting up Keycloak internally
  * Configuring Keycloak settings as SAML based IDP
  * Configuring internal keycloak as the relying party trust in MS ADFS services
  * Configuring MS ADFS as the Claim Provider Trust in internal Keycloak
  * Testing full cycle of Infotrac SSO through Keycloak as the Internal IDP.

  

## Requirements from Client or Vendor

  * Metadata File: Metadata file for claim provider trust configuration in XML format from SAML standard IDP.
  * Service Provider / Relying Party Trust Configuration: Full configuration of Infotrac SSO's MS ADFS as the relying party trust in the client-side IDP.
  * Claims: Client-side IDP must provide required claims for Infotrac SSO in each authentication request.

##  **Estimate:**

Development Hours: 50 to 70 hours (May vary depending on the client-side IDP's
configuration complexity)

Testing Time: 24 to 32 hours
