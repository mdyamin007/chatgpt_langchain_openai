## User interaction and design:

  * The default language of the site will be English. If any user logs in for the first time, he/she will view the site in english. 
  * There'll be a language preference option. Users will be able to change the language preference of the site using this option. It can be a select dropdown. 
  * Once the language preference is set, the site will proceed with the user's preferred language. 
  * The user's language preference will be stored in local storage. If the user logs in with the same browser in future, the site will appear in his/her previously preferred language.
  * We'll maintain two properties file for each language. One file is for English and another one is for Chinese. In these files, we'll store the verbiages as a **key-value** pair. Keys will be same for both files. Values will be according to the languages.
  * We'll place the values from these properties files on the frontend. If language preference is English, we'll pull the corresponding values of a field from messages_en_US.properties file using <fmt:message/> tag of jsp. If the language is chinese, values will be pulled from messages_cn_CN_properties file.
  * <fmt:message /> will pull the value of the corresponding key from the properties file. properties file will be selected based on the user's preferred language. We'll identify the language using <fmt:setLocale /> tag and select the corresponding properties file using <fmt:setBundle /> tag.
  * Below is the comparison between the existing implementation and our planned implementation.

Comparison

 **Current Implementation:**     <h2 style="color:#ED1B23;"> Enrollment- Step
1 of 3 </h2>

 **What we're gonna do:**          <h2 style="color:#ED1B23;"> <fmt:message
key="enroll.test.title"/> </h2

  

  * Below are the sample of two properties files :  

messages_en_US.properties

enroll.test.title=Enrollment - Step 1 of 3  
enroll.test.estmtVerifyText=Using the buttons below, please indicate whether
you can see the sample East West Bank eStatement.  
enroll.test.canViewButton=I can view the statement  
enroll.test.canNotViewButton=I can not view the statement

  

messages_cn_CN.properties

enroll.test.title=\u62A5\u540D-\u7B2C1\u6B65\uFF0C\u51713\u6B65  
enroll.test.estmtVerifyText=\u8BF7\u4F7F\u7528\u4E0B\u9762\u7684\u6309\u94AE\uFF0C\u6307\u793A\u60A8\u662F\u5426\u53EF\u4EE5\u770B\u5230\u793A\u4F8B\u4E1C\u897F\u94F6\u884C\u7535\u5B50\u6708\u7ED3\u5355\u3002  
enroll.test.canViewButton=\u6211\u53EF\u4EE5\u67E5\u770B\u8BE5\u58F0\u660E  
enroll.test.canNotViewButton=\u6211\u65E0\u6CD5\u67E5\u770B\u8BE5\u58F0\u660E

 **Note** : We'll convert the english verbiages into chinese and put it as the
value. As, properties files are not typical text files, it'll not support
chinese characters. So,it'll be converted to supported format in the
messages_cn_CN.properties file. We'll just have to open this file with a
"properties file editor", not with any text editor. for example:

English| Chinese| messages_cn_CN_properties file  
---|---|---  
Enrollment- Step 1 of 3|

    
    
    -13

| \u62A5\u540D-\u7B2C1\u6B65\uFF0C\u51713\u6B65
