#### XML

Extensible Markup Language, a flexible way to create common information
formats and share both the formats and data on the World Wide Web and
Intranets.  
  

#### SOAP

Simple Object Access Protocol. A way for a program running one type of
operating system to communicate with another program using the same or
different operating system by using the World Wide Web and its HTTP (Hypertext
Transfer Protocol) and its XML (see above) as the means of exchange. Think of
this as the "grammar" for XML.  
  

#### WSDL

Web Services Description Language. An XML based language and a derivative of
SOAP (see above). As further explained by the [W3.org](http://W3.org) group:
As communications protocols and message formats are standardized in the web
community, it becomes increasingly possible and important to be able to
describe the communications in some structured way. WSDL addresses this need
by defining an XML grammar for describing network services as collections of
communication endpoints capable of exchanging messages. WSDL service
definitions provide documentation for distributed systems and serve as a
recipe for automating the details involved in applications communication.  
  

#### UDDI

Universal Description, Discovery and Integration. An XML-based registry for
businesses worldwide to list themselves on the Internet. Its ultimate goal is
to streamline online transactions by enabling companies to find one another on
the Web and make their systems interoperable for e-commerce.
