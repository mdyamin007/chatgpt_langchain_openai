# Sub-Organizations

* * *

FCSB have two different CIDs: FHNB and FNBT.

# WebServices

* * *

These are essentially APIs that the client calls to perform various
create/update/get actions on users and accounts.

See .

# Email

* * *

## Notification Preference

Notification preference is stored by User.

Each user can have up to two email addresses, i.e. there will be up to two
NOTIFICATION_PREFERENCE record.

## Email Restriction

Both the admin user and the primary user can choose to restrict emails from
being sent out to one or both of the email addresses on profile. This
restriction is stored in the RESTRICTION table by NP_ID. This is how the email
query knows which NOTIFICATION_PREFERENCE record to ignore for the user.

# Viewer User Profile

* * *

Viewer user profiles are similar to subusers. These user profiles can have
access to a subset of the accounts accessible by the Primary user. Both the
bank admins and the Primary users can create viewer accounts and manage their
access to accounts.

# Tax Accounts

* * *

FCSB cannot provide account numbers in tax statements, and as such, we use the
TIN/SSN to post.

## Auth File

In the Auth File, the TIN/SSN is provided with every record. For every line
processed, the Auth File will search to see if an account with account number
= TIN/SSN and type SS. If the account doesn't exist already, the process will
create the account.

## eStatement Site

When an SS account is selected on the eStatement Site, the default tab will be
Tax instead of the default logic.
