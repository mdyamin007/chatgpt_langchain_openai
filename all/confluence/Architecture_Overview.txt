## Preliminary TKCU Q&A

  1. Provide TKCU with the technical documentation revolving the how we encrypt and store eSafety box content:
    1. What is the encrypt method we use?  
 **Ans.:**  AES-256 encryption. on each file level. files eventually will be
stored in swift as object store. Hence files cannot be read directly even got
a copy of the files from file system.

    2. Does the password used in the eSafety box act as a seed value for the encryption of the files?  
 **Ans.:**  no, using Org-id & user-id as seed value. (Lisa will double check
and confirm)  
<notice>LZ: For the login password, we are hashing
"${orgId}.${usrId}|${passwor}" with "SHA-1". For password in eSafety box, we
are using MD5 to hash the ${password} with ${usr_id} as seed.</notice>

    3. Are the files saved on shared storage or they separated in our SAN environment?  
 **Ans.:**  They are in shared location right now, all in single swift
deployment (multi-node), but not SAN disk anymore.

    4. Would like to see the file storage architecture on how their data is stored.  
 **Ans.:**  Dharmi will show an architecture doc around the
Swift+OpenStack+RESTful_API+VirusScan

  2. Provide TKCU with the technical documentation on our password requirements:  
 **Ans.:**  Instead of providing too much flexibility to allow each CID to
implement it's own password policy, we would provide a pre-set of 3 policy so
that they can pick and choose:

strongest| 8 characters, alpha + numeric + special char + min 1 upper & 1
lower  
---|---  
stronger| 8 characters, alpha + numeric + special char  
strong| 8 characters, alpha + numeric  
    1. Are passwords changed periodically?  
 **Ans.:**  no. maintaining password expiration policy is annoying for both
user and service providers.

    2. What are the minimum password requirements?  
 **Ans.:**  see above

    3. Can the CU define the strength of the password requirements?  
 **Ans.:**  see above

    4. How is the password stored? (i.e. What is the encryption method at?)  
 **Ans.:**  one-way hashed value in oracle db. i.e. cannot be reverse-hashed
to see original password

  3. The following are follow-up questions that the customer was looking for a response to:
    1. Can we disable the eSafety box password feature? The CU is concerned w/ supporting end-users with the management of passwords.  
 **Ans.:**  yes, need some additional coding. might not be in first release,
but soon after.

    2. Can the define the password requirements at the time implementation?  
 **Ans.:**  see above of pre-set password requirements

    3. Can they have both home banking and standalone solution?  
 **Ans.:**  Per confirmation of Kim, the answer was yes.

    4. What's the average pricing model that FI's typically charge their end users?  
 **Ans.:**  Kim would answer this one.
