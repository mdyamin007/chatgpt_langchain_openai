Description  
  
---|---|---|---  
1| MAINTCODE| Y|

The action to be taken. Currently support two actions:

A: Add - add/update the user-account relationship

D: Delete - delete the user-account relationship, e.g. unlink the user from
the specified account. If the user is unlinked from its last account, the user
will be deactivated.  
  
2| CIF| Y| The unique identifier for the user. This is typically the SSN/TIN,
the Member Number, or any other unique identifier that the client is using.  
3| ACCTNAME| Y| The account owner name.  
4| ACCTNUM| Y| The account number.  
5| ACCTTYPE| N| The account type. This is only required for setup where
account numbers are not unique, and as such the duplicate accounts need to be
differentiated by different account types.  
6| TAXID| N| This is only required for DSO. The CIF is not always the TAXID,
which is why this column is needed.  
7| USRNAME| N|

The user name. If this value is not provided, the ACCTNAME will be used. This
value is typically the same as the ACCTNAME, but in the case of co-ownership,
USRNAME John Doe may be linked to ACCTNAME Jane Doe.
