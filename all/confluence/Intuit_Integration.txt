## Widgets sample and PPT provided

## Evaluation notes - 2013-06-06

  1. Need explicit spec on how the classes are defined in the theme CSS files. Examples:
    1. always prefix with 'ifs-'? Have seen some other like '.simple-' type of prefixed classes also.
    2. have seen '-widget-', '-container-', '-branded-', '-overlay-', '-modal-' in sample CSS files, what are the variations?
    3. do suffixes like '-panel', '-header', '-title', '-body', '-content' have corresponding positioning meaning for us to follow within the widget?
    4. There are variations like '-body' vs '-content' that we couldn't tell from the sample files what their differences are.
  2. Any particular HTML structure expected in order for the themes to work properly? By looking at the sample, we couldn't tell how we could populate the contents properly. Example:
    1. For the Container Type 1 - Primary
      1. <div id="type1primary" class="ifs-widget-panel ifs-container-one ifs-primary-container">  
    <div class="ifs-widget-panel-header">  
        <h3 class="ifs-widget-title">Primary Type 1</h3>  
        <a class="ifs-widget-help-link" href="javascript:;"></a>  
    </div>  
    <div class="ifs-widget-panel-body">  
        <div class="ifs-widget-content">  
            <div class="ifs-widget-content-header">  
                 Type 1 content title  
            </div>  
            <div class="ifs-widget-content-body demo-content">  
                 Type 1 panel content<br>  
                 ...<br>  
                 ...<br>  
                 ...<br>  
                 ...<br>  
            </div>  
        </div>  
    </div>  
</div>

      2. Tried multiplying the `ifs-widget-content-header` `<div>` blocks and the tabs are not rendered properly. Expecting the tabs would be rendered horizontally instead of vertically.
      3. Tried multiplying the `ifs-widget-content-body` `<div>` blocks, but assume that would rely on some javascript library to handle the tab switching mechanism. Currently there is no javascript included in the sample widget package. Need more info around that.
  3. Similar to the tabs mentioned above, Will the javascripts library around the interacts of balloons/dialog boxes be provided also upon integration?
  4. Does the modelMask has any specific meaning we should be aware of?
  5. Assuming the positioning of the dialog and balloon will be controlled on our side, correct?
  6. There are CSS class like `.ifs-overlay-left-arrow` but only having 'left-arrow'. Assuming there will be full set of up/down/left/right arrows supported upon actual integration?
  7. Not able to find any sample usage of the LESS code in the sample package. Need code sample to showcase us how Intuit would like to utilize LESS to control theme-switching easily while we as vendor only need to implement a single codebase with proper HTML/CSS structure. Main thing is to see how/what we specify to choose which theme.
