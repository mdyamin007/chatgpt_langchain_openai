## Some file still have the hard-coded logic:

  1. RoleService.java:
    1. getRolesByUserAndClient(User currentUser, Client currentClient, boolean activeOnly)
      1. activeOnly not in use in this method
      2. AdminLevel.ADMIN should be consolidated to URF model.
  2. UserService.java:
    1. getPermissionsByUserAndClient(User user, Client client, boolean activeOnly)
      1. AdminLevel.ADMIN should be consolidated to URF model.
  3. FeatureManager.java
