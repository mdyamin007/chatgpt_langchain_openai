# Common Questions Around Color Message Manager  
  
---  
Question| Outcome  
  
  *  **Which depts are involved _when existing clients currently using preprint paper_ , want to switch to color (like for like)**

|

If the customer provides the preprinted paper, we need the pdf for the
preprint.  If we are providing the preprint currently, then we should have the
pdf already.  The process involves Ops printing out the pdf from the color
printer and works with CP to adjust the color setting on the pdf if needed.
Once the color variance between the preprint and the one from the color
printer is down to an industry acceptable level, Ops directs IS to turn the
pdf into an 'eform' which will get embedded at the printer level as the job
gets printed out.  

ISD does not need to get involved because there are no programming changes,
statement and archival are not affected at all.  
  
  *  **Which departments are involved _when existing clients printing on house stock_ today would like to change their black/white logo to color:**

|

We would like to get their color logo in EPS format & the CMYK values for
their brand colors.  CP will convert the EPS to tiff for IS.  IS will modify
programs to use the color resources for paper, online proofing, Advanced
online proofing, estatement and archival if needed.

ISD will upload the color resource from IS and test estatement.  If changing
the logo involves website or any other e-side updates, ISD will need to be
involved in those areas.  
  
  *  **Who is going to analyze the request and confirm we can proceed?**

|

The existing process of Programming Requests / JEFs addresses this workflow.

As with any change affecting Inventory, please be sure to include the
Inventory Specialist in your communications/tickets.  
  
  *  **If it is a same-day turnaround and the printer is down, what is the back-up plan?**

|

There is no same day turn available for these products.  
  
  *  **Are there any images, colors that cannot be supported?**

|

300dpi images, the same the client uploads today, is the image limitation.

For Message Manager, there is no color matching available.  We will print the
closest approximation to the image -uploaded.  
  
  *  **Once live will we need additional approvals of output?**

|

That is dependent upon the client's request.  
  
  *  **Do we need an SOP for converting preprint to color print?**

|

The SOP/workflow for converting preprint to color was documented between IS
and Ops. This process does not normally engage with AS or AM.  
  
  *  **If there is an issue during EOM regarding color, how will we address it in time to meet SLA?**

|

InfoIMAGE retains preprint shell inventory for backup in extreme cases.  

There is no back up for the CS6900 in TX today.  The Menlo printer will be the
backup (except in cases of inserts or custom envelopes).

Menlo will host 2 I300+ series printers for redundancy.  
  
  *  **Will the color sample be printed and placed in the docket every time a new campaign is created?**

|  There is no need as the RTWO will be updated with the instructions, and
full viewing is available from Prisma.  
  
  *  **Are all preprints slated to be converted?**

|

All preprints cannot be converted due to color gamut limitations across
lithography printing and inkjet printing, or full-bleed requirements.

All clients do not contract with InfoIMAGE Inc for the purchase of their
preprints.  Depending on the requirements of the preprint, this can be a sales
opportunity.   In TX, this refers to GCBK and SNFB.

All preprints where colors can be matched within a 2 Delta E variation will be
converted.  
  
  *  **What are the specifications for the message for the upload; are they the same as what the client has to send now?**

|

The specifications are exactly the same as for the current message manager
upload; with the exception of they need to be in color if the client wants
them printed in color.  
  
  *  **Is there a different maximum file size for upload?**

|

The specifications for message manager file size do not change based on the
image being in color or monochrome.  
  
  *  **The message manager site currently displays image specs for upload, will this be updated based on color vs b/w logos?**

|  This is updated based on text versus images and the size of the message
manager box.  
  
  *  **Will graphic images only be made available for color, or will text-based messages be available for color also?**

|  This enhancement is for color **graphics** in the message manager only.
