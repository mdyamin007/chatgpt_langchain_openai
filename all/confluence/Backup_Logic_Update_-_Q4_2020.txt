## Goals

  * Update backup logic to set a new status in archival status. 

## Background and strategic fit

  * Remove conflict with process status when the backup step fail.
  * Prevent backup failure from affecting accounting reports.

## Assumptions

  * All ProcessingJob that has backup callback that are not no-op will use the Backup Helper to backup the file and also update statuses.
  * Sometimes, the Backup Helper is used only to move files, and does not update the job status (as part of the backup callback function). In these instances, no change is needed. 

## Requirements

  
| Title| User Story| Importance| Notes|  **Pilot**|  Production  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
1| Backup Helper Status Update| As a Processing Job that needs to back up my
index file, I would like to be able to use the Backup Helper to update the
status of the job, so that in the future, when the backup logic needs to be
changed, fewer places will need to be updated.|  _Must Have_|

  * The two functions, updateStatusAfterSuccess and updateStatusAfterFailure are already writtenin the BackupHelper on Development.
  * The BACKUP_FAILURE status is also already added to JobStatus.

2| PUI Processing Job| As a Processing Job that needs to back up my index
file, I will only flag the Archival Status as failed instead of the main job
status, so that a backup failure will not affect accounting reports.|  _Must
Have_|

The base backup function should be like so (additional logic maybe needed
depending on the job):

3| PUI Front End| As the PUI, I would like to be able to display jobs with
archival status of BACKUP_FAILURE with the red UI, so that developers will be
aware of when backup is failing.|  _Must Have_|

  * The condition to display the RED Error background in the Action column should now also include a check for BACKUP_FAILURE archival status.
