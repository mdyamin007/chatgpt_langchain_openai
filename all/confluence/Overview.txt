o  **Pending** : Payment is tied to a bill and is scheduled to be submitted to
Authorize.Net for a future date. Pending payments may be cancelled before the
submit date. After the submit date, pending payments may change to a
Processed, Failed or Open status.  
o  **Failed** : Payment was not processed by Authorize.Net. Possible reasons
may include: expired credit card, etc.  
o  **Cancelled** : Payment has been elected not to be submitted to
Authorize.Net. Possible reasons may include: patient made a By Request payment
and afterwards saw that there was a scheduled auto-payment that he/she may
have forgotten about, so he/she cancelled a pending payment  
o  **Open** : An issue between the connection from the PayeBill system to the
Authorize.Net system occurred, preventing the transaction to be processed
fully. There is a possibility that the transaction was processed on
Authorize.Net's system, but the connection was lost before the PayeBill system
got a successful response code.
