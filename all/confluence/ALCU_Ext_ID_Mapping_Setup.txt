## Goals

  * Scanner should be able to move input file from FTP-root folder to PUI 'download' folder
  * Be able to match Pseudo Number to Business Number in db
  * When user logs in with pseudo number,  E-Site will show them logged in as business number

## Background and strategic fit

This will provide client's users with the ability login with number 'xxxx1234'
and correctly be routed to 'xxxx5678'

## Assumptions

  * Pseudo number and business number will not overlap
  * Client will provide index file with only two columns:  **Pseudo Number | Business Number**
  * Input file naming convention:  **alcu_pseudo_crosscref_mmddyyyy.txt.pgp**
  * ALCU uses diSSO as 3rd party vendor
