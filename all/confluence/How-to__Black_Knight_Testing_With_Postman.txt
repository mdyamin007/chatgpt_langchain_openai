title: How-to: Black Knight Testing With Postman
body: For testing the API endpoints, use Postman. There is a shared account with
username "infoimage" and the ISD (m) password.

To learn about Postman, and its feature, go to:
<https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/introduction/>.

Currently, everyone can access the same account. There should be a way for a
team to work on the same collection (everyone gets their own account). This is
something that will need looking into.

# Requirements

  * For local testing, ensure that the local environment is setup and the applications are running.
  * (Optional) Port access to the auth-server application server port 9000. Otherwise, the Version test won't work.
  * (Optional) Port access to the bki-docs application server port 5000. Otherwise, the Version test won't work.

# How-to

  1. Install Postman
    1. Postman-win64-9.14.0-Setup.exe in shared-drive:ISD/ISD software
  2. All API endpoint tests are grouped into collection by environment
    1.   3. If testing the local environment, ensure that both services are up and running on the local machine.
    1. Reference  and  for local setup instructions.
  4. For the DocumentList and Document API, an oauth token must be obtained.
    1. OAUTH is not tested directly, but indirectly via the authorization required by the Docs Service.
    2.     3. Occassionally, it is a good idea to go to  **Available Tokens** ->  **Manage Tokens** in order to clear out expired tokens.
  5. Update URL, Environment variables, and other values as necessary for the API calls.
    1. Environment variables are used to provide a layer of obfuscation, so that sensitive information such as credentials and account numbers are not overly visible on screen.
      1.       2. Alternatively, you can also create a new set of Environment variables to test multiple set of values at the same time. Remember to set all values as secret, so that, by default, they are hidden.
    2. For the GET Document API, there is on additional variable to change: the docID.
      1. This value is not as sensitive as other pieces of information. And being able to change in the Request editor is more convenient.
      2.     3. For the Version endpoint in non-Local environment, it needs to access the server application directly, since that is how InfoConfig will access the endpoint. The endpoint cannot be accessed via the DNS. The proxy denies all access so that it will not be publicly available.
      1. The Version test requires the local machine to have port access to the application server. This may not be a good idea for the higher environment. Instead of using Postman, log into the proxy server and run

bashMidnight

  

      2. To test that the endpoint is inaccessible from proxy, use the "Version Deny Test".
  6. Click the **  **button to make the request.
