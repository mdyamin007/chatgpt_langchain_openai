title: Message Manager Feedback
body:   

Area| Feature| Item| Addressed| Validated  
---|---|---|---|---  
Session| Timeout|

Potential solutions:

  * InfoTRAC should prompt with a popup about session expiring so that the user can extend the session
  * Automatically save everything when session timeout, so that no changes are lost

|  
|  
  
UI Space  
  
  
|

Minimize iFrame Look

  
  
  
|

Potential solutions (doesn't have to do all)

  * remove top padding
  * remove border
  * background should be white to match InfoTRAC
  * increase the height of the main screen
  * scale down elements so that they would fit into 1080p resolution

Step 2  
  
  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

| Text Editor  
  
|

Automatically expand in length when text input takes up more than viewable
space. User cannot resize the box themselves.

| done| done  
  
Count characters instead of words

| done| done  
  
 **To discuss with Print team** : support for bullets, numbered lists,
indentations, horizontal line, and line spacing

\--may be possible: need to work on this further

|  
|  
  
Criteria|

Deletion should have confirmation window

| done| done  
  
Rate should not allow letters

|  
|  
  
Setting Default Message|

"Setting this tab as a **default message** will remove the ability to set
targeting criteria"

| done| done  
  
For non-floating message, the default message checkbox should be disabled.
There should be a tooltip saying "Tab X is already the default message".

|  
|  
  
Marketing link|

Validation for URL

| done| done  
Add new Message|

Default to newly created message

| done| done  
  
Ensure that the newly created message editor do not have information from
other messages, e.g.

  *     * images should be blank
    * "mirror from eStatement" should not be flipped to true

| done|  
  
Delete message|

Refresh the numbering

| done|  
  
  
Automatically load the message to the left. (Last message cannot be deleted)

| done|  
  
  
Switching between tabs

|

Prompt the user of unsaved changes to ensure they are not lost.

"You have unsaved changed. If you proceed , all unsaved changed will be lost."

Choices

  * Save & Proceed
  * Proceed Without Saving
  * out of box + Cancel

\--clicking outside the module will close window

|  
|  
  
Apply changes|

The editor view should stay on the message that was just viewed

| done| done  
  
  

|

Highlight errors when unable to save

  *     * Red asterisks next to the area, "Criteria", "Text", "Media" (specifically eStatement image or Paper)
    * For criteria, highlight the input box that has issue.

| done|  
  
End of Statement| Newly created campaign will have Tab A automatically filled
as Default with Empty Message| done| done  
Message Area Edit| Do not allow a default message to be reordered. Messages
"Default message cannot be moved"|  
|  
  
Templates|

  * Templates need to be by Message Area
  * If does not exist already, templates need to be validated against criterias. Should not show if templates have criterias that aren't available. Maybe we can just do this instead of assigning templates to Message Areas.

| done|  
  
Step 3| Criteria Validation|

Validate criteria in a similar way to Step 2.

  * Highlight criteria that has issue

|  
|  
  
Media Library| QR| "QR code" field should be "Destination URL"| done| done  
Image|

  1. "File name" field should just be "Name"

| done| done  
Home Page| Review Approved|

We need to reintroduce the "Eye" icon. What this should do is:

  * Open up a pop-up that's similar to the "Approve/Unapprove Campaign". This way, the user can review the dynamic sample PDFs without having to click Unapprove. 
  * In addition, there should be a button at the top of the table "Message Simulation". This will lead to the Simulation module.

| done| done  
Unapprove| Unapprove Pop-up says "Approve Campaign". Should show "Unapprove
Campaign".| done| done
