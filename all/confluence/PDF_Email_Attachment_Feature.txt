title: PDF Email Attachment Feature
body: **Features:**

  * Email Notification w/ encrypted PDF attachment
  * How do we manage PDF passwords?

>   * During onboarding/implementation process, we will ask client for a batch
> file contain all the accounts and passwords that we need to assign at the
> time of installation
>   * We need to develop a password reset self service feature for both the
> end-user and the Admin site
>   * During a new user enrollment process, we will prompt them after the
> disclosure the option to choose this PDF email attachment services. In order
> to do so, they must electronically consent to use this system and have an
> electronic delivery preference for the account.
>

 **Development Approaches will be broken into three areas:**

  1. UI Design - Web Flow -> (Development by eServices group/potentially re-use old developed code)
  2. Processing code to generate PDF files at the time of processing prior -> (Research by Joe C on the Apache AFP2Web)
  3. Email Engine to send secure PDF email attachment in bulk -> (Product Development group. Zimbra/Mule/Niraj)

 **Notes:**

  * We will design it so that we have Multiple user to many account relationship
  * There will one password per user
  * End user can decide to change preference on their own to whether or not to have Email Attachment feature. Keep in mind they must have a "electronic" delivery preference to have the ability to choose this feature. Should the individual account preference goes back to paper preference, the end-user will not have this feature and will not get email notifications
