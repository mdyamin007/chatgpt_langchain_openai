title: get PDF endpoint modification
body: **Previous Design:** **  
**In previous design, get pdf endpoint takes **cid, documentId, and
statement** type as a required parameter. Previous design flowchart is given
below.

  

  

 **New Design:**

In the new design, We can add a new field as a parameter in the endpoint named
**" archFileId"** which will be an optional parameter and make the documentId
optional as well in newly designed endpoint. So that we can support all the
modules as before and also online proofing as well. Here I am attaching the
new get pdf endpoint design.
