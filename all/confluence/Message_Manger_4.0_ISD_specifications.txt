title: Message Manger 4.0 ISD specifications
body: _**Client Feature settings:**_

  We have to add new features  under client Management feature settings to
select Message Manager 4.0. Should be similar to 3.0 as shown below.

 _ **Message settings updates:**_

Need to add 2 parameters to support floating message and end of statement
message.  These 2 are text messages.

Business rule:

  * There should be only one text message area that can be configured as floating. It should be last configurable message on page. All fixed messages should be at top of floating messages on a page.
  * We can configure end of statement message area either floating or fixed. This will always show on a new page and will be last page of a statement.
  * If end of statement is configured, UI of message area should show check box to select end of statement when creating a campaign. If end of statement is selected, left side view should show new page with message area to be editable. Also left side area of message should be scroll able.

Limitation:

  * We cannot control location of message area which can have floating point message. Developers who is configuring this must know.

 [Need confirmation] : We need to seek confirmation about this. May be we can
provide instructions on this page.

  

 **Communication with print program scripts:**

When we approve a sample from Message manager module, we store zip file in a
mounted location and pass zip file information to print side script command.
Zip file contains a text file known as portal file. We need to pass 2 new flag
parameters for message area.

  

 _Portal file:_
