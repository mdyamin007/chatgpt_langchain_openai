#### What is User Purging?

|

#### Product Overview

Client can send InfoIMAGE a list of users (Unique User Identifier) for
purging.  Users will be purged along with any related information such as
email address. For setup that enables SSO via a file processing such as the
Auth File, the user will no longer be able to log in. For setup that allows
SSO at-will, if the user does try to log in again, they will be treated as a
new user.

Accounts will be unlinked from the user. If the user is the last enrolled user
linked to an account, the account will be changed to Paper delivery. This is
because an account needs an enrolled user in order to be delivered
electronically.

There will be remnant user entries that are kept for auditing purposes. For
example, if a user changed the paperless status of an account, we'll need to
keep the user record to maintain the paperless status history. However, this
will be transparent to the client and customer.

This feature will only purge the user's information.   All the accounts that
are associated to this user will remain in InfoIMAGE's system.  If our client
want to purge closed accounts as well, please refer to the [Closed Account
Purging](https://confluence.infoimageinc.com/x/4YAuBQ) feature.

  
  
  
#### Where does User Purging fit?

|

#### Client's Fit

This feature allows client (Bank Model) to clean up users that no longer have
account with the bank or business sub-user that are not longer with the
business.  This allow our client to ensure that any business sub-user who
longer working for the businesses are not longer have access to their
accounts.

#### InfoIMAGE's Fit

This provides InfoIMAGE with a way to free up repository and risk holding onto
user's information that are not longer with the bank or the businesses.
