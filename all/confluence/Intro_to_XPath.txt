XPath is a powerful language that is often used for scraping the web. It
allows you to select nodes or compute values from an XML or HTML document.

## XPath Selectors

Expression| Description  
---|---  
nodename| Selects all nodes with the name "nodename"  
/| Selects from the root node  
//| Selects nodes in the document from the current node that matches the
selection no matter where they are  
.| Selects the current node  
..| Selects the parent of the current node  
@| Selects attributes  
  
### Examples

Assume this is our XML document

xmltrue

    
    
      
    

Path Expression| Result  
---|---  
`bookstore`| Selects all nodes with the name "bookstore"  
`/bookstore`| Selects the root element bookstoreNote: If the path starts with
a slash ( / ) it always represents an absolute path to an element!  
`bookstore/book`| Selects all book elements that are children of the bookstore  
`//book`| Selects all book elements no matter where they are in the document  
`bookstore//book`| Selects all book elements that are descendants of the
bookstore element, no matter where they are under the bookstore element  
`//@lang`| Selects all attributes that are named lang  
`/bookstore/book[1]`| Selects the first book element that is the child of the
bookstore element.  
`//title[@lang]`| Selects all the title elements that have an attribute named
lang  
`//title[@lang='en']`| Selects all the title elements that have a "lang"
attribute with a value of "en"  
`/bookstore/book[price>35.00]/title`| Selects all the title elements of the
book elements of the bookstore element that have a price element with a value
greater than 35.00  
  
## XPath Operators

Below is a list of the operators that can be used in XPath expressions:

## XPath Functions

Function Name| Example| Result  
---|---|---  
starts-with(path, string)| `/journal/article[starts-with(author/last,"Mc")]`|
Find all authors whose last name begins with Mc  
contains(path, string)|  
|  
  
ends-with(path, string)|  
|  
  
if(Boolean,object,object)|  
|  
  
sum(node-set)|  
|  
  
  
There are many functions, you can look them up from here [XPath
Functions](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xsl_functions.asp)

Please check and try if that functions is supported by this module.
