## Goal:

  * Remove all instances of User/Customer Name from both Admin site and eStatement site.
  * Update email templates to use AcctName instead of UserName so that the email is sent out with the Account Holder Name instead of the User Name.

## Requirements:

  
| Title| User Story| Importance| Notes| Pilot| Production  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
1.| msm| As an EWBB admin, I would like to able to search for an account
information by account number and able to view the account owner name along
with other informations.| Must Have|

  * If that account is associated with multiple account, a list appears where "Account Number", "Application" and "Customer Name" is shown. According to current implementation of EWBB, "user_firstname" appended with "user_lastname" [from USR table] is shown as "Customer Name" . Now, after this update, "account_owner_name" [from FIN_ACCOUNT table] will be shown as "Customer Name". 
  * If a specific account is needed to be viewed, by clicking the particular "Customer Name", a page appeares where, Under Account Information section, both "Customer Name"(from USR table) and "Account Holder Name"(from FIN_ACCOUNT table) is shown. After this update, only "Account Holder Name" will be visible.

  * For EWBB email templates, it uses the "sdv_txt_userName" as system variable which gets replaced by "usr_firstname". After this update, it'll use "sdv_txt_acctName" so that, email templates get created where this "sdv_txt_acctName" variable gets replaced by "acct_owner_name" from "FIN_ACCOUNT" table.
