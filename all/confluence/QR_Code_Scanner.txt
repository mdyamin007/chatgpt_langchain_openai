title: QR Code Scanner
body: ## Library for scanner QR Code:

  * <http://webqr.com/>
  * We can just download the library and integrate into whatever application needed for scanning the QR Code.
  * It's a javascript library, hence no server side library/package needed.
  * Need to deploy this on an application served via https, otherwise the browser will prompt for permission every time.

  

## Camera evaluation

 **Camera**|  Scannable?| Cost  
---|---|---  
Logitech regular webcam| No, cannot focus| ??  
Dell Laptop built-in cam| Barely, only able to scan with very steady/still
image| N/A  
Mac Air built-in cam| Yes, very easy to scan| N/A  
Logitech C525| Yes, very easy to scan| $40-60  
Microsoft LifeCam Cinema HD (720p)| Yes, easy to scan| $40-$80  
V7 HD Cam 720p (Unknown brand)| Yes, very easy to scan| $25-$40  
  
 **Summary:**  Brand doesn't seem to make much difference as long as they can
produce 720p or above resolution, and focal length to start aroun 7-10cm. It
would able to work.
