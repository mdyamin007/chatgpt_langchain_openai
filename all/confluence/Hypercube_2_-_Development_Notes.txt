# 8/2 Feedback

Component| Decision  
---|---  
Dashboard|

  * Four different layout for Dashboard
  * Fixed height for unviewed notice 
  * For unviewed Notices/Documents, no pagination. Instead have View All, which will lead to another view with the entire list.

  
Account Card|

  * Center vertically if just one line of information
  * Fix space between cards
  * Fix height of card (the current height with one line should be enough for two lines)

  
Profile|

  * Trim size of npValue box based on the length of npValue
  *  ~~Remove pop up and inline edit doesn't need to be worried about the height of card~~
  * User info same card for as account preference for byUsr np update. If has DSO info, will show up on the right of the DSO info.
  *  ~~Account Preference edit - delivery button and if available show an explanatory text below~~

  
Application-wide|

  * Show edit button when the cursor enters component, hide on exit. (Application-wide design)
  * Change icons to those available on Figma component
