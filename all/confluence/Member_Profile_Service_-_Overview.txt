title: Member Profile Service - Overview
body:   * The  **eSafetyBox**  and eStatement applications have identified integration points to use the Mule-ESB REST Service for the Member Profile management purpose.
  * The  **eSafetyBox**  application will REST service for profile state management like in-active, active, suspended, closure, closed.
  * Currently,  **eSafetyBox**  application store & access profile details under the Oracle database and use JDBC calls to perform the CRUD operation. Under new proposed implementation, it will call the REST API to perform the required operation such as create/retrieve/update/delete.

Given below key requirements identified for the implementation:

  1. Change Member profile/account status (ACTIVE -->CLOSED or CLOSED -->ACTIVE) through the Admin-site or Member-site profile page
  2. Member changes eStatement paperless status through the Member-site profile page ('paper -> e' or 'e -> paper')
