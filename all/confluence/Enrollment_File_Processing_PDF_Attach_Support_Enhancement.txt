## Goals

  * Enhance the enrollment file process to support the provision of the pdf attach passwords.

## Background and strategic fit

InfoIMAGE supports three types of notifications: **email** , **sms** , and
email with pdf  **attach** ment. The enrollment currently only support
**email** and  **sms**. The enhancement to support  **attach** also will allow
us to leverage the enrollment file for clients who wish to use the  **attach**
feature.

## Assumptions

  * Attachment Password (AttachPw) will be an additional column in the.
  * AttachPw is optional and will not be validated unless the Notification Preference column contains "attach".
  * The registrar will not update email_attachment_status and email_attachment_password unless the Notification Preference column contains "attach".
