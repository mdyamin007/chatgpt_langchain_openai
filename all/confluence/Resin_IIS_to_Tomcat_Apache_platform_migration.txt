title: Resin/IIS to Tomcat/Apache platform migration
body: # Resin/IIS to Tomcat/Apache platform migration

  

## Servers involved

  

## Configuration details

### Tomcat App servers

  1. APR

  

### Apache Proxy servers

  1. [Migrate IP filter from Windows IIS to Apache Server](https://confluence.infoimageinc.com/display/PD1/Migrate+IP+filter+from+Windows+IIS+to+Apache+Server?searchId=QFFRD46N2)

  

## Load Tests

## IMPORTANT THINGS to KNOW

  1. External IP to Virtual IP routing, need to use the same external across all CID going forward
  2. Meaning SSCU doesn't need to make DNS change as they are the first one, but all subsequent CIDs will need to change DNS values on their side.

  

## TODOs before 2015-01-24 Maintenance window

  1. Change tomcat server.xml to point to real production server (was pointing to cloned db for load testing)
  2. Install javamelody to monitor server status
  3. Update apache settings to block external access to javamelody (i.e. /monitoring)

  
  

## Instruction for Existing Resin Client migrate to Tomcat

### Tomcat Server (This should be applied to one server at a time, all
variable with ${} should be replaced accordingly. Below will be using TKCU and
production environment as an example.)

  1. Add the client folder under tomcat-${schema}/i3webapps/${orgName}  
I.E. tomcat-cu/i3webapps/tkcu/

  2. Make sure the logging.conf is under tomcat-${schema}/i3webapps/${orgName}/logging.conf  
I.E. tomcat-cu/i3webapps/tkcu/logging.conf

  3. Kick off the jenkins job to deploy to the server accordingly. (You should have the msm.war and ROOT.war after the jenkin build completed successfully)  
I.E. You should see files below at this steup.  
tomcat-cu/i3webapps/tkcu/logging.conf  
tomcat-cu/i3webapps/tkcu/msm.war  
tomcat-cu/i3webapps/tkcu/ROOT.war

  4. Shut down tomcat server. Please be extra mindful that the server start and shutdown should be executed as role "tomcat"  
I.E. "sudo -u tomcat /usr/local/tomcat/tomcat-cu/bin/shutdown.sh"

  5. Modify the tomcat-${schema}/conf/server.xml and add the CID server information.  
I.E. Add your CID info to tomcat-cu/conf/server.xml

  6. Start the server. Please be extra mindful that the server start and shutdown should be executed as role "tomcat"  
I.E. "sudo -u tomcat /usr/local/tomcat/tomcat-cu/bin/start.sh"

  7. Safety purpose, please ensure to modify the local hosts file to add in the ${orgName}${sysEnv}.[infoimageinc.com](http://infoimageinc.com):${schemaPortNumber} and do a quick testing to ensure that the tomcat setup is successful before move on the apache setup.  
I.E. <https://tkcuprod.infoimageinc.com:9880/msm/login.jsp>. You should be
