 **Venue:**  Conf Room #1  
 **Attendees:**  Kim, BenC, Niraj

 **Agenda**

  1. Team presented high-level implementation details for the InfoTRAC and FiServ integration using MuleESB.
  2. Discussed MuleESB workflow covering Service Layer for client (InfoTRAC - REST/JSON), database (JDBC) and external server (FiServ - SOAP/XML web-service).

 **Action Items:**

  1. Prepared sequence diagram covering end-to-end implementation details
  2. Work on the REST framework and Workflow Rule engine e.g. Drool, jBPM

 **Next Steps:**

  1. Documentation - Prepare Sequence Diagrams. Upxdate Design doc.
  2. Implementation -
    1. Build REST/JSON Service for the client (infoTRAC).
    2. Build Database update/insert service to capture the FiServ profile data details.
  3. Code deployment on MuleESB and testing

  

## 2012-12-27 - Demo - Follow-up Discussion

 **Date & Time:** Thur 12/27 @11:00am PST

 **Points Discussed:**

  1. Customer REST API - Performance and scalability of REST+JPA Interface
    1. Define XML and JSON enity objects for the Customer and use toggle feature for the XML/JSON result.
    2. Discused Hibernate & SpringDATA-JPA implementation (follow-up discussion required).
  2. Rule Engine (Drool) - Need to explore more to build the rule-engine in MuleESB.
    1. Go thru Drool to understand the Rule engine (not immediate, low priority item).
  3. SAFE Credit Union PoC - Jan month (for FileNET integration)
  4. FTP Scanner PoC in Mule - Work on Mule PoC by next month to build the RegEx based file-listing processing for FTP
    1. Also, work on the fussy logic for the file-name date-pattern in order to select the unassociated file(s).  
#Audit Log feature in MuleESB - Explore & use built-in feature instead of
developing from scratch.

  5. Database - Oracle Vs MySQL support for the MuleESB - Check the support for Database.

 **Action Items:**

  1. Schedule meeting with Ben and Dharmendra for the Hibernate & SpringDATA-JPA follow-up discussion by Jan-15.  
Meantime, have informal discussion with Dharmendra.

  2. Check MuleESV support for the MySQL database.
  3. Explore Drool rule engine.

  

## 2013-05-08 - Design Discussion

 **Date & Time:** Wed 5/8 @4:00pm PST  
 **Venue:**  Ben's office  
 **Attendees:**  Ben C and Niraj

 **Points Discussed:**

  1. Mule SFTP Scanner Service - Testing and Go-Live!
    * a) Parallel testing covering two source SFTP Servers.
    * b) Update email notification list to include email-ids for Ben and David
    * c) Custom handler coding & testing
    * d) Ensure validation of CRC and MD5 of files are put in plan
  2. MFA Service - Design & implementation
    * a) DB schema - introduce one more column for the expiry period. Similarly, add one more input field in the REST POST - JSON input data.
    * b) Consider Group-Id or CID field along with user-id field in input data, which will support multiple FIs/CIDs in order to keep unique transaction record. It will introduce one more filed/column in the DB Table. Discuss with David to finalize the field definition.
    * c) Transaction_status field length - varchar(3) to store status. Currently, it is defined as varchar(20).
    * d) Logic around expiration of token values
    * e) Logic around flexibility of token length
    * f) Update Wiki with API entry points and response structures
  3. SSCU (Pathways) - Instant Enrollment Service - Design & implementation
    * a) Keeping in view of the member-service/admin-service APIs, change the REST URLs.
    * b) Use SSL Cert based authentication feature. OAuth2.0 may not be required at this stage.
    * c) Further discussion required to finalize the design (Friday meeting)

 **Action Items:**

  1. Update wiki site for the latest request/response JSON data captured during the testing for MFA.
  2. Schedule meeting with David's team for discussion.
