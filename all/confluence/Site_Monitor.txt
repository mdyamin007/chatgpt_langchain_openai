To get access you need to ask someone who can login as Admin eg. David Trang

  * Login Screen ( you need to know your hint question answer to login)  

  * Page you login to which Current status shows the status of different clients. Some clients are permanently disabled. Once in pink if they are disbabled are the ones with issue and alert would go out. When you set up a client sometimes the changes don't get reflected right away might take a few minutes.  
You can globally enabled and disable monitoring on this page.

  * Click on New Monitor Link to when adding a new client  
This is where you have the option to enable or disable. Till you test it you
can set it to disabled permanently.

  * There are typically 5 urls(steps) configured per client. 4 of the 5 urls are Admin Site and 1 url is member site. You can test each of the steps when you configure it. Or you can test all of them too.

eg. if you look at step 2 of CVHS it is used to verify if sitescope user is
able to login to AI site.  
> the form data needs to be updated depending on what data the form on that
> url is expected like login credentials, some data to search etc.  
eg. it would be this for login com.infoimage.auth.userid=sitescope
com.infoimage.auth.password=!nt3rNal  
eg. sQuery=5507576-001 when searching in a page  
You can click on other clients to see how they are configured.

Screenshot below shows us how CVHS is set up
