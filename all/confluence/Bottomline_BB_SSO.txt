body: # Bottomline BB SSO

## Init-params:

All available int-params are given below:

  * EmailUpdate (optional)
  * hasAcctType (optional)
  * isPrimaryCifRequired (optional)
  * acctLogic (optional)

## Description:

  *  **EmailUpdate:**  true/false (  **default is "true"** )  
true : If the email in DB and email from SSO are different than the system
will update the email in DB  
false : The system doesn't update the email in DB.

  *  **hasAcctType:**  true/false (  **default is "true"** )  
true: Account/s coming from SSO is/are expected to have acctType.  
false: Account/s coming from SSO is/are not expected to have acctType.

  *  **isPrimaryCifRequired:**  true/false (  **default is "true"** )  
true: The primary CIF coming from SSO of the subuser must be present in our DB
otherwise it will throw an exception.  
false: If the primary CIF coming from SSO of the subuser is not present in DB
then the system will create the primary user and let the subuser to the login.

  *  **acctLogic:**  addAdd/addRemove/removeAdd/removeRemove (  **default is "removeRemove"** )  
Values of the acctLogic has two part.  
 **First part:**  Should the system create or ignore subuser's account which
aren't in primary user's account set.  
 **Second part:**  It is like the DI acctLogic config. By this part the system
will know that the exiting UFA relation/s which is/are not come from SSO
should be removed or kept.

  
  

### Explanation of all possible values of acctLogic:

1.  **addAdd:**  It will create the new account/s for subuser which aren't in primary user's account set and also doesn't unlink any existing UFA relation of the subuser.
    
    
    Ex. Primary user has access to account 1,2,3 and one Sub-user comes in with accounts like of 2,3,4. 
    Then the system will create the sub-user with account 2,3,4.
    After that if the subuser again comes in with an account like of 2,4. 
    Then the system doesn't remove the UFA of 3 account as the config has "addAdd" value.
    

  
2.  **removeAdd:**  It won't add any new account for subuser and also doesn't unlink any existing UFA relation of the subuser.
    
    
    Ex. Primary user has access to account 1,2,3 and one Sub-user comes in with accounts like of 2,3,4.
    Then the system wont create the new account 4. So the subuser only have 2, 3 account. 
    After that if the subuser again comes in with an account like of 1, 2. 
    Then the system doesn't remove the UFA of 3 account as the config has "removeAdd" value.
    

  
3.  **addRemove:**  It will add the new account/s for subuser which aren't in primary user's account set and unlink the existing UFA relation which aren't coming through SSO for the subuser.
    
    
    Ex. Primary user has access to account 1,2,3 and one Sub-user comes in with accounts like of 2,3,4.
    Then the system will create the new account 4 for subuser.
    After that if the subuser again comes in with accounts like of  2, 3. 
    Then the system will remove the UFA of 4 account as the config has "addRemove" value.
    

  
4.  **removeRemove:**  It won't add any new account/s for subuser and also unlink the existing UFA relation/s which aren't coming through SSO for the subuser.
    
    
    Ex. Primary user has access to account 1,2,3 and one Sub-user comes in with accounts like of 2,3,4.
    Then the system wont create the new account 4 for the subuser. So the subuser only have 2, 3 account.
    After that if the subuser again comes in with an account like of  1, 2.
    Then the system will remove the UFA of 3 account as the config has "removeRemove" value. 
    So after login the subuser will only have 1, 2 account. This behavior is the default one. 
    

  
  

## Note:

If the isPrimaryCifRequired config is false and the acctLogic is
"removeRmove"(default one) or "removeAdd" then the current system will throw a
MISSING_UFA error  
In that case both the primary user and subuser will be created but as the
acctLogic's first part is "remove" so the system won't create any subuser's
account and also can't pull from primary user's account set as the primary
user is new and no account is linked to the primary user.  
For that reason the current system will throw a MISSING_UFA error.
