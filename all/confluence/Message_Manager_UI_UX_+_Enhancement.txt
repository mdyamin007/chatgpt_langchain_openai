## Goals

  * To improve the UI/UX of Message Manager while also enhancing the product with additional features that allow for more flexibility in how clients display on statement messaging. 

## Background and strategic fit

Certain functionality was requested from a larger client. Rather than just
implement the requested functionality, we want to take the time to update the
product as a whole and assess both the UI and UX to offer value to all clients
and ensure that the product is brought current by todays standards. We
conducted several client feedback sessions and identified the top areas
clients would like to see improved in the Message Manager product.
Implementing these changes while delivering the functionality the original
client request will ensure that we have customers who feel their feedback is
being heard and applied.

## Assumptions

  * User has message manager or is on the most current version of message manager
  * User currently creates on statement messaging 

## Requirements

  
| Title| User Story| Importance| Notes|  **Pilot**|  Production  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
1| Advanced Targeting| The user should be able to select criteria on a per
message box basis within a single document| Must Have|

  * Additional considerations or noteworthy references (links, issues)

|  1 incomplete Assignee |  2 incomplete Assignee  
2| Fluid/Floating Message Boxes|

Defined Message areas that can increase and decrease in height depending on
the criteria matching

| Must Have| Question for David: The height of a message area is configured
from the message settings page and it is fixed. How can we increase or
decrease the height depending on the criteria matching?|  
|  
  
3| Fixed Message Boxed| Fixed width and height and can only apply to one set
of criteria| Must Have| Question for David: If a text area does not have fixed
height and width and if a user puts long text, will it overflow over the image
content?|  
|  
  
4| Fixed Message Box Tabs (Numbered)| Fixed message boxes with a tabbed like
heading (numbered) that allows the user to add ( + ) or remove ( x ) tabs in
order to add additional targeted text or images in a certain fixed message
area| Must Have| Determine the maximum number of message areas that user can
add|  
|  
  
5| Fluid/ Floating Message Box Tabs (Lettered)| Variable sized boxes with
tabbed like heading (lettered) that allows the user to add ( + ) or remove ( x
) tabs in order to add additional targeted  **text only** within a defined
message area.| Must Have| Determine the maximum number of message areas that
user can add|  
|  
  
6| Priority Selection| A drop down that appears when editing a specific
message box that allows the user to choose in which order the selected message
box is assessed when matching against criteria. Changing a boxes priority to a
higher or lower priority moves that tab to its respective spot on the message
boxes tab lineup| Must Have|

We will exclude the dropdown. We will display a text saying "The tab number
represents the priority. You can change the priority of the messages by
rearranging it."

We will also display the priority number of a particular message when the user
selects it to update

|  
|  
  
7| Enable Floating Text in Message Admin Settings| Checkbox to turn on| Must
Have|  
|  
|  
  
8| In-line Text / Image Editing area | Rather than having a pop up that allows
you to edit you images and text, it is instead build inline to the right of
the document that is being edited. | Must Have| Doable|  
|  
  
9| Criteria Selection Area (Document editing step)| a section located above
the text/image editing area that allows the user to define which data
points/fields are to be assessed on that particular message area & tab. It
will also contain a drop down to load saved criteria layout and a dropdown to
define and uploaded list instead of specific criteria| Must Have| Doable|  
|  
  
10| "Add End of Statement Messaging" Checkbox| A checkbox which, when checked,
creates a Fluid Text Only box at the end of a statement that works the same as
the on statement fluid text boxes| Must Have| Doable|  
|  
  
11| Pop Up Prompt (End of Statement)| A pop up prompt that alerts the user
that end of statement messaging may drive an additional page|  
| Doable|  
|  
  
12| "Preview Document"| A button on the builder page that, when clicked, opens
a new window with a generated preview of the document based on the currently
active/editing message box| Must Have| The file has to be processed by the
print side. Once it is done processing we will display it in a new window.
This processing may need some time|  
|  
  
13| "Test Criteria" button| A button on the Document preview page which, when
clicked, reveals the Criteria Entry section to generate previews| Must Have|
Doable - **  _Evaluating_**|  
|  
  
14| Pop Up Proofing prompt - Print|

A Pop up which gives the user the ability to choose how they would like to
receive their printed proofs for review.

 ~~ **Option A -** Receive a printed preview of each fixed message and each
fluid message independently of one another -  _This option means there will be
a printed individual proof showing each fixed message and each fluid message
alone._~~

 _ **Option B -  Receive a printed preview of each fixed message and 1 single
proof of all fluid message boxes combined. Number of Fixed Images * 1**_

 ~~ **Option C -** Receive up to (X) number of proofs -  _determined during
setup_  ~~

| Must Have|

1 Fluid Message = 1 proof

2 Fluid Messages = 4 proofs

3 Fluid Messages = 8 Proofs

4 Fluid Messages = 16 Proofs

 _ **example**_

A document with 1 fixed message box and 1 fluid message box each containing 4
tabs will generate 20 individual documents.

\------

The calculation used to determine number of individual proofs pages printed
where **n= number of fluid tabs** and **x= number fixed tabs**

  * Document Building / Criteria Entry Page  **before a box is selected**

  

  * Builder when a Fixed message box & tab are selected - Note the delete icon to remove the tab, the Text / Image editor is now inline and not a pop up and the green header denoting with tab in which module is being edited 

Tabs for displaying Estatement images vs. Paper Statement Images

Toggle for selecting to mirror image to paper statement or choose standalone
image for each

  * Builder when a Fluid Message box & tab are selected - Note the lack of media editing capabilities and the notation of fluid boxes being "text only"

  * At any point during editing the document, the user can click on the "Preview" button and will get a pop up ina new window that generates a preview of the message box and tab curently being edited and all other default message boxes that arent active message box areas. 

  

* * *

  * End of Statement Messaging / Onsert Checkbox + Checkbox selected. 

.           **WHEN Checked, prompt comes up "End of Statement messaging will
drive an additional page, would you like to continue" **  

  *  **NOTE: "Next" / "Previous" Buttons are not shown in these mockups but they will remain only at the top of the page as they are today but not at the bottom to reduce clutter. Ive added them to the next screen to portray what click next does once the document and messaging and criteria have been entered. **

 **.  **

* * *

  * Document Preview Page - User can test against the various criteria they've entered to see what document will look like when generated
    *  **NOTE: Ned to add a help icon once the document preview is generated that tells the tells the user why they see the results they see. i.e "You don't see any fluid message boxed because the criteria you entered does not match any of the criteria entered during the building step. If you think this is an error please uyse the previous button to edit your critiera, then try testing again"**

 **Default view before criteria are tested is Tab 1 of each message box
only.**

 **When "Add Criteria" is selected **

used are displayed at the top for user reference.
