Every year the SAML Certificate needs to be updated to match NCR's new
certificate.

We replace the certificate in the ca-hypercube servers:
/home/meteor/certs/certificate.crt file

Change owner and group to root. Chmod 755.

Get on a phone call with NCR as well as someone from NECU (Jovia) to test
their Business users' SAML SSO request.
