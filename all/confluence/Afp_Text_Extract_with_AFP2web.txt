title: Afp Text Extract with AFP2web
body: **Ben** : Hi. Amjad,

Please see attached for the sample AFP2TXT files that Ernest generated.  
It looks like the TXT files need some clean-up to read the values inside those
tags only for ES to crawl.  
Check it out to see if that's something you can use as-is. If not, would you
need some pre-processing? or in other format?

Thanks.

 **Amjad** : Hi Ben,

I am not sure why we are using txt files (AFP2TXT) for ES to crawl, whereas we
can use pdf (AFP2PDF) for ES to crawl, Finally based on ES search result we
have to open corresponding pdf.

 **Ben** : Because we don't have PDF stored at rest. All the documents are
stored as AFP at rest.  
Ernest provided us the PDF for ease of viewing.  
Here is the flow:

AFP & TXT --> ES Crawl & Index  
Search Query with 'keyword' to SearchAPI (developed by you), which internally
call ES  
ES find 'keyword' in 12345.TXT  
ES respond result with 12345.TXT to SearchAPI  
SearchAPI use the '12345' filename to locate the corresponding 12345.AFP  
Call AFP2WEB with 12345.AFP to convert 12345.AFP to 12345.PDF  
Open 12345.PDF and locate all instances of 'keyword' and highlight them using
iText (or equivalent)  
Return 12345.PDF with 'keyword' highlighted.  
I think there are still adjustment need to be made for the workflow above.
e.g. search and PDF render should really be separated as two steps, because
there could be multiple hits and only need to show PDF when user click on one
of the search results.

Another one being I'm not sure how exactly the AFP2WEB is done currently. Jay,
could you chime in on how this particular step should be handled? If we have
an API readily available for fetching PDF based on 12345 (or EDOC_ID, etc),
maybe the step 1 above only need the TXT, not the AFP at all?
