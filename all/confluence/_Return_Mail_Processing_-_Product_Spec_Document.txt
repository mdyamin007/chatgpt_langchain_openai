#### What is Return Mail Processing?

|

#### Product Overview

The return mail processing product that InfoIMAGE offers allows our clients to
maintain a high-quality mailing list by updating address changes and providing
a report to the client. InfoIMAGE provides the client with a report that will
prevent the client from mailing to bad addresses or provide address updates as
provided by the USPS via a Nixie label.

#### Features Include

  * First Class Mail Only*
  * Change of Addresses
  * Undeliverable Addresses
  * InfoIMAGE to set up the 2D glyph on the mail pieces to include the account number and document type (i.e. notice or statement)
  * InfoIMAGE to set up the return address 
  * As the return mail is received, InfoIMAGE scans the glyph to create an electronic report of the account number and document type.
  * InfoIMAGE will also enter any information included on the envelope from the forwarding order including return reason and any forwarding address (es).
  * InfoIMAGE will verify if any non-InfoIMAGE generated documents are received, InfoIMAGE will forward those directly to Financial Institution.
  * InfoIMAGE will then send the electronic report directly to the Financial Institution as per the schedule.
  * InfoIMAGE will then shredded the mailpieces on-site immediately for security.

  
  
#### Where does Return Mail Processing fit?

|

#### Client's Fit

From routine account statements to time-sensitive notifications, first-class
mail remains a central part of how our clients engage with their customers or
members. That's why undeliverable mail can be costly - potential lost revenue
and customer relationships.  By keeping this in house InfoIMAGE provides a
secure and reliable service that effectively manages our customer's
undeliverable mail.

#### InfoIMAGE's Fit

Return Mail Processing will allow for our operations team to turn the
"downtime" that they experience during mid-month into productive and profit-
generating time by utilizing the Return mail processing platform capturing
returned mail.

#  **Common Questions Around Product**  
  
---  
Question| Outcome  
Can the report be sent in CSV format?|

Yes, we have made the product where a client is able to download and view the
information in CSV format.  **Make more clear**  
  
Is a client able to search by a name?| Yes, the customer will be able to
search by a specific member/customer name. We have also allowed this
searchable function to be date based as well.  
How long do you hold a mail piece for?|  
  
Why does a customer need Extended Tracking?| Clients with mail tracking where
mail team is giving information like account number, mailing address, etc. For
return mail, using same process to capture same information.  
Will the PO Box be a Texas or California PO Box?|

Dependent on size and demand, initially, the PO Box will be in Texas and, if
needed, can be expanded to California. If necessary, we will purchase a new
caller box to keep up with the demand.

The current PO BOX is:

PO BOX 9001

Coppell,TX 75019  
  
How often will you process the return mail?| We will be processing return mail
between Monday and Friday. However, with that said, the timing of when the
mail is sporadic return mail is sporadic, we aren't certain when the return
mail processing will happen.  
Does each client get an individual PO Box?|

In practicality, yes, they do; however, these are caller boxes that all return
mail pieces will go to. So the mail will be "co-mingled" and sorted at
InfoIMAGE. Once the caller box is not able to hold the volume InfoIMAGE will
purchase a new caller box and the PO Box # will be added  
  
Will the return address for the customer be their return address or will it be
InfoIMAGE PO Box?| The return address will be InfoIMAGE's caller PO Box.

The question of forwarding mail from PO box to PO box:  You probably need some
background on this to understand why the answer to the question they asked is
No. However, there's another option to consider.

A little background first: In order to not pay $0.55 apiece postage, the USPS
says you have a responsibility to maintain your address database and ensure
the address on your mail is accurate.  If the USPS is discounting the postage
rate, it's b/c a significant amount of work is done on their behalf.  It
reduces their labor cost, transportation cost, etc.  So with return mail, the
USPS has additional labor effort involved in their internal processing of the
piece.  It's a complex system and comes at a cost to them.

So the answer to the question of whether the USPS will forward return mail
that has already been delivered to its return address is no.

Now, if the client wants to take their own return mail, and ship it to us at
their expense, we're happy to take it and provide the same return mail
processing service.   And that would not change the price of the service.
Because there is no change to the service we provide.  Except that the client
wouldn't be saddled with weekly UPS shipments back to them of mail pieces that
are sent to the return address but do not have nixie labels on them.  
  
Will InfoIMAGE provide the return reasons?| Yes, InfoIMAGE will provide the
return reason to the customer, which will be detailed in the report to view
why the mail piece was returned.  
What is a Caller Box?| This is a PO Box that can receive large amounts of
mail. Compared to many small PO Boxes.  
What happens if a FI customer sends InfoIMAGE a check?| When we receive mail
that is not related to return mail processing we will collect that and every
week send a shipment back to the client and bill them for the shipment.  
How often are reports sent to clients?| Currently, we have the reports being
sent one time a week on Fridays at 5pm CST. This will allow for all mail
pieces to be captured for the week. If a customer would like a more frequent
report they will need to access InfoTRAC and the Return Mail tab as a self-
service tool.  
Does the Report History include the reports InfoIMAGE automatically sends?|  
  
  
Can a client use our service for just our processing and returning those mail
pieces to them each week, even though there will be no 2D glyph and they can't
be included in our reporting?
