title: FCSB User Management Web Services
body: # User Management Web Service API

## Introduction

This web service API is customized for First Community Services (FCSB) only.
Through the web services, FCSB will be able to register any new users and/or
accounts in the InfoIMAGE eStatements system. This document will describe how
to use the web services.

## Connection to the web service

All web service connections should be established under HTTPS protocol. Each
web service request should be submitted in HTTP POST. For security reasons, IP
filtering will be setup during the installation so that only the web service
connections coming from FCSB will be allowed to access the eStatements system.  
Although Fort Hood National Bank (FHNB) and First National Bank Texas (FNBT)
are both under FCSB, different URLs will be used to access the same web
service. For example, to retrieve a user information from FHNB through the web
service: GetUser, the URL will be: <https://statements.fhnb.com/GetUser.ws?>  
Similarly, for FNBT, the URL will be:  
<https://statements.1stnb.com/> GetUser.ws?  

## Response from the web service

The response from every web service will be described in XML. Since the XML
structure is different from one web service to another, please read the
specification of each web service for more details.

## Web service

This section will describe the web services that are available to FCSB.

## _Toc197408475 EnrollUser

completed.  
If the user or anyone of the accounts does not exist in our system, we will
