title: Unix to SMB mount point setup using autofs
body: There has been multiple ways utilized to mount windows/samba file-systems to
Unix environments.

  1. manual mounting using pre-written shell script
  2. using /etc/fstab to mount on boot
  3. let program/application to do on-demand SSH connection to destination server. Example:
    1. shell scripts having hard-coded user/password and doing ssh/scp/rsync commands
    2. java applications storing all host/credentials as hardcode/config/property values

  

## Issues:

  1. mount point not mounted properly at boot or network issue cause mount point to be broken, cause application stop functioning
  2. server/credential change require application code-change to synchronize the change

  

## Benefit of using autofs

  1. pre-configured path and credential on system level, easy to change if needed. no application config change needed
  2. mount connection gets dropped if idle, but automatically remount upon usage comes. Hence even it got disconnected for any reason, it automatically remount upon usage.
