###  **User-account Relation:**

  * Many to Many

### Login methods:

  *  ** _diSSO:_**
    * Mandatory fields: cif_num (leading zeros get removed), email, password, gmt, timeout
    * Must provide an existing cif_number. If no user is found with that cif_number from the usr_mapping table, throws an error. Shows errorMessage: INVALID_USERINFO and return.
    * Searches for user profile from usr_session. [usr, usr_fin_account, fin_accoutn, usr_session, usr_mapping] by the cif_number. If no user is found, creates a new user. sess_login_id = !usr_id, sso=null, dso=null. Insert into USR, USR_SESSION.
    * If the user found and login status is "Invalid", show the error message "DISABLED_USER" and return. 
    * If login status is "inactive", set status ="active" and sets loginName=!usr_id and save to usr_session table.
  * #### SSO (SingleSignOnServlet): 

    * Mandatory field: Data
    * search user from usr_mapping by cif_number. If not found, return CIF_NOT_FOUND and redirect to error page.
    * If user found searching by cif_number
      * Search user profile by sess_login_id from usr_session. If user not found, create new user with loignName=!usrId, DSO=null, SSO=null , sets ssoKey and insert to usr_session.
    * Searches user by ssoKey from usr_session. 
      *  If user not found, redirect to error page and login failed.
      * If user status is inactive, login failed and redirected to error page.

For both diSSO and SSO,

  * If DSO=null && SSO=null, go to enroll/test.jsp.
  * If DSO != null && SSO= null [If user has enrolled via DSO already, and never login via SSO ]
    * Set the current date as SSO and save to usr_session.
    * Searches for ufa for that user. Mark every ufa as "update" and insert into log_record as event_type="update"
  * If DSO = null && SSO != null && login status="pending", [ This user was created through web services with only a sso]
    * Go to pending/test.jsp

###  _Enrollment:_

  * Step 1 of 3: pdf view
  * Step 2 of 3: E-Statement Disclosure
  * Step 3 of 3: Delivery preference, notification preference set. 
    * 2 emails can be set. Emails fields are non-editable.
    * Emails are pulled form np table. If no record is found on np table, email fields remain empty and therefore the user can't choose paperless as dp. 
    * Account Number shows as masked.
    * Email is updated only when the user has less than 2 emails.
    * Emails are auto-checked if that entry is not listed in the RESTRICTION table. 
    * Insert into log_record : eventType='update'
    * If an email is checked and that email is previously listed on RESTRICTION table, delete it from RESTRICTION table. And insert into audit_log_fnbt [ location="ssoRgstr', event='restrict']
    * If email is not checked and this email wasn't in restriction, insert this email into restriction table and insert to audit_log_fnbt [ location="ssoRgstr', event='restrict']
    * Update ufa status="active", setRegDate=current date and save to UFA table.
    * If paperless status which is passed from enrollment step 3 is different from db, update paperless status, insert into Paperless table. Insert into audit_log_fnbt [ location="ssoRgstr", event="paperless"]
    * Insert into audit_log_fnbt [ location="site", event="enroll"]
    * Send a welcome email after enrollment. Insert into welcome_email_log

###  _Enrollment (status= pending)_

  * For pending enrollment, If the user type is N, during enrollment step 2, shows commercial disclosure (commercial_disclosure_inc.jspf). For other types of users, shows as usual disclosure.

###  _Homepage:_

  * ###  _SSO_

    * The first opt-out account of UFA i.e. paperless status is E or W, which is either DD or SV is displayed as selected in the e-Statement tab. UFA is ordered by acct_number.
    * If the account status is "C", it shows a message. Your account has been closed for more than 13 months and you can no longer access it. No statements are displayed. 
    * While selecting an account from account dropdown, If the paperless status is B or, status is E or W but no email, redirect to opt out page. If the user is of type "V", this user is redirected to the viewer's opt out page. This scenario happened only if this user doesn't have any ufa i.e. UFA length is zero.
    * If the account type is SS, etax tab is auto-selected after landing on the homepage.
    * If stmtType=default and acctType is neither DD nor SV, enotice tab is auto selected. [if etax is not present]
    * If the User type is N, then show Authorized Viewers. Can create and assign viewers.
    * If the paperless status is B, go to opt-out page. 
    * System maintenance information is shown according to the data in the p_maintenance table.

  1. Uses user mapping
  2. sess_logi_id is "!"usr_id
  3. Uses Notification preference table

so no migration is needed.
