title: Hypercube Mobile App Design Doc
body:   

## Technology Stacks:

 **Language** : Javascript  
 **Framework** : React-Native

 **Build Tools** : expo, react-native-cli

  

On application start up the Hypercube app will look for SSO key from URI
context. After we get the SSO key, the application hits the SSO exchange of
Hypercube and

on successful sso validation the Hypercube UI get rendered. If the Hypercube
fails to validate the key, it gives a feedback on the same UI.

  

 **Development Environment** :

  1. Node Js (version, 12+)
  2. NPM (version 6+)
  3. Any Code editor (ex. vs-code)
  4. React Native Installed
  5. Expo cli installed

 **Running the application** :

To run the application developer should install expo mobile app from Play
store.

To run the application following command should be run:

    
    
    expo start  
      
    A web interface will be opened in your default browser and you will see a QR code at the left panel of your browser.  
    Scan the QR code with your expo mobile app and you should see the application running on your device.  
      
     **Building APK:**

To build publishable android package (APK) run the following commands first:

    
    
    mkdir -p android/app/src/main/assets
    
    
    react-native link react-native-webview
    
    
    react-native bundle --platform android --dev false --entry-file index.js --bundle-output android/app/src/main/assets/index.android.bundle --assets-dest android/app/src/main/res  
      
    After successfully running the application you should see two extra directories:  
      
    android, for the android build  
    ios, ios build  
      
    For the Android open the android directory with Android Studio and build the APK from there  
      
    For the iOS open the iOs directory with XCode and build iOS publishable package
