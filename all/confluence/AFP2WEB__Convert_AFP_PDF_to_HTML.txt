## InfoIMAGE wishlist:

  1. Convert positioned block (e.g. address block, account summary) to HTML DIV tags that carry corresponding position info (either CSS or HTML inline styles)
  2. Convert transaction list/tables into HTML tables that we can apply javascript libraries on top to support search/sorting type of interactions
  3. Convert rich-media type of content over to HTML corresponding tags (e.g. background, images, embedded/streaming video, etc)
    1. Specifically, we need help on how we can programmatically place a streaming video into the PDF, and
    2. All the video & rich-media content need to be transformable to corresponding HTML elements.
  4. Proper paginations when content span across pages need to be stitched back together (e.g. transaction table could be long enough to go across two pages, but on HTML rendered page, it just need to be on a single continuous table)

## Daniel's notes (2014-01-27) :

  1. About Rendering: we have today the possibility to convert PDF2HTML within AFP2web. Actually you can try it by yourself today. It's a rudimentary and more or less a first implementation. This means they are many possibilities to improve it (and we already have a list of improvements :-)).
  2. The PDF format does contain any semantic (like caption, anchor, block, list or table). It just contains texts, lines, images and vector objects at some positions. This means that in order to identify something in a PDF (the same holds true for AFP), we will have to add some intelligence in AFP2web ! Actually we did a similar project once for a customer (see attached pdf).

## Meeting Action Item (2014-02-06) :

  1. We have clarified the business needs listed in above wishlist. See attached for the sample PDF (w/ video), standalone video, target HTML set. (sent to Daniel)
    1. We most likely would like to slice the statement contents to be in modules so that we can pick and choose what modular-template to use. e.g. header, address-block, marketing message, account-section-header, account-body, transaction-table, ...etc
  2. Daniel to evaluate and provide a draft proposal on how the AFP-to-HTML conversion templating framework will look like.
  3. Daniel to re-group with team to provide info on how a video stream could be incorporated into the AFP/PDF in order to get same experience as what we showcased in the bill_qr_video.pdf. If you host the attached MP4 on any HTTP server, Adobe Reader should allow playing it back as it supports video streaming via RTMP, HTTP, HTTPS.  <http://help.adobe.com/en_US/acrobat/X/pro/using/WS65B80E79-F165-44f0-BBCA-0F142A758696.html>
