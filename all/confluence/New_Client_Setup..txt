## Windows setup

All files are located here  
Dell-2100\ISD\Projects\PayeBill\40-Development\New_Setup_offshore  
  

### DB setup

  * Run the payebill setup sql using . [Setup SQL](https://i3dev.easyredmine.com/projects/payebill/wiki/Setup_SQL)
  * Populate the data which typically PUI process will do [PUI SQL](https://i3dev.easyredmine.com/projects/payebill/wiki/PUI_SQL)

  

### HOST setup

  * Copy the payebill JSP folder (from codebase tar) provided to C:\hosts folder i.e. C:\hosts\payebill
  * Open the file C:\hosts\cid\msm\WEB-INF\web.xml  
Do not change the following payebill to your cid:  
<context-param>  
<param-name>com.infoimage.dtd</param-name>  
<param-value>d:/hosts/CID/ROOT/dtd/payebill.dtd</param-value>  
<description>The full file path of DTD</description>  
</context-param>

If the PayeBill client falls under the Nordis-Convergent umbrella, keep the
following variables the same (used to pull PDF statements from Nordis eXpresso
system):  
nordis.Uname: AH84C  
nordis.accCode: 7f7d9ec3-9744-4cd3-95ee-d5417915daaa  
nordis.CID: 90  
nordis.email: [dsamuilov@nordisdirect.net](mailto:dsamuilov@nordisdirect.net)

    
        Replace nordis.Uname, nordis.CID, nordis. accCode, nordis.email if the PayeBill falls under a different Nordis client. This should be part of the deliverables.  Variables will not be needed    if PayeBill client does not come from Nordis partnership.

  * Same thing as above applies to C:\hosts\cid\ROOT\WEB-INF\web.xml

  

### RESIN SETUP

  * Stop your local resin  
Copy payebill service folder to  **resin_location** \conf\service\payebill  
Rename payebill to your CID (e.g. huhs)

  *  **resin_location** \conf\service\huhs\loggin.conf in this file change  
logger.payebill to logger.CID (e.g. logger.huhs)

  * Open resin.xml
    * Add this entry  
copy this part to estmt cluster section in resin.xml  

<host id="template" root-directory="*hostlocation*/hosts/template">  
<host-alias-regexp>.*: 9381</host-alias-regexp>  
     <web-app id="/" document-directory="ROOT">  
    <access-log path="../log/access.log" rollover-period="1D" />  
    <stdout-log path="../log/stdout.log" rollover-period="1D"   
        timestamp="[%m/%d/%y %H:%M:%S] " />  
    <stderr-log path="../log/stderr.log" rollover-period="1D"   
        timestamp="[%m/%d/%y %H:%M:%S] " />  
</web-app>  
<web-app id="/msm" document-directory="msm">  
    <access-log path="../log-msm/access.log" rollover-period="1D" />  
    <stdout-log path="../log-msm/stdout.log" rollover-period="1D"   
        timestamp="[%m/%d/%y %H:%M:%S] " />  
<stderr-log path="../log-msm/stderr.log" rollover-period="1D"  
        timestamp="[%m/%d/%y %H:%M:%S] " />  
</web-app>  
</host>

        
                  

    * Replace template with cid
    * port number 9381 to your new port number for this client.
    * Make and entry like below to your list of servers in your cluster. Replace port with your value eg. 11861 is the port of huhs  

<http address="*" port="11861">  
                <jsse-ssl self-signed-certificate-name="resin118611@localhost" />  
        </http>
        
                   

### Front End Customizations for the Client

  1. Replace the client-specific Nordis configurations in hosts/CID/ROOT/WEB-INF/web.xml and hosts/CID/msm/WEB-INF/web.xml if the PayeBill client does not fall under the Convergent (CRCM) umbrella. You can reuse the same variables for all Nordis PayeBill set-ups.  
a. nordis.Uname  
b. nordis.accCode  
c. nordis.CID  
d. nordis.email

  2. Email notification content through AI site Email Proofing module [Email Content](https://i3dev.easyredmine.com/projects/payebill/wiki/Email_Content)
  3. Client contact information in /msm/include/define.jsp and /ROOT/include/define.jsp
  4. Turn off ACH payments in /ROOT/include/define.jsp if applicable  
private final boolean SUPPORT_ACH_PAYMENT = false;

  5. Set the correct ARCHIVAL_PERIOD in /ROOT/include/define.jsp
  6. Replace logos and color schemes on AI site and Member Site through host-static style sheets. Looking at jsp you can find out where the logo should be placed.  
root/styles/payebill.css is the style she where colors need to be changed as
per the client

  7. Remove "Patient Rights Summary" and/or "Privacy Policy" links in /ROOT/footer.jsp if necessary
  8. Customize enrollment opt-out verbiage. Ex: removed verbiage pertaining to ACH payments if it does not apply.
  9. Put the right sample pdf file in the right location - huhs\ROOT\dso

### Java Customizations for Client

Some of these files might have already been covered in previous steps.

  1. I3-Core Code  
a. /i3-core/com/infoimage/financial/payment/plan/PlanFactory.java  add your
cid  
b. /i3-core/com/infoimage/financial/payment/plan/CIDPayeBillPlan.java  create
a class for clients payment plan  
c. /i3-core/com/infoimage/financial/payment/vendor/PaymentVendor.java  add
your cid here  
d. /i3-core/com/infoimage/util/security/UserServiceFactory.java. add your cid
here

  2. Processing-UI Code  
a. / processing-
ui/com/infoimage/processing/application/auth/AuthRegistrarFactory.java  add
yr cid here  
b. / processing-
ui/com/infoimage/processing/application/payebill/CustomizedEntryPointFactory.java
 add your cid here  
c. / processing-
ui/com/infoimage/processing/application/accounting2/ReportHandlerFactory.java
 add your cid here

  3. Dp.jar - need to change only when doing production deployment  
a. /dp-dev/dp/com/infoimage/dp/scanner/handler/PayebillFileHandler.java  add
your CID here in the subCids string array. - this is for handling the
automation of file processing when in production.

  4. Infoimage-Commons Code  
/infoimage-commons/com/infoimage/constants/OrganizationEnum.java  add your
CID here

  

### Processing-ui setup:

a. If no folder structure has been created on input_dev, please create
"\\\10.8.8.216\input\I3\process-files\${CID}\" and "b.
\\\10.8.8.216\input\I3\process-files-backup\${CID}\".  
b. Copy \processing-ui\conf\payebill.conf to \processing-ui\conf\${CID}.conf
and make customization if needed.  
c. modify "hosts\processing\Root\applications\selectOrg.jsp" to include ${CID}
for processing.  
d. Add an entry for your new client at
"hosts\processing\Root\Report2\select.jsp" for the Accounting Report.  
e. Add you ${CID} to "\processing-ui\schedule\payebill_cid.txt" for payebill
paperless, payebill_preSchPayment and payebill_autoPayment will pick your
client up when release to production.  
f. Release the infoimage.jar and processing-ui.jar and etc.  
  

### Scanner setup:

If you have local scanner setup, you can test it locally by replace dp.jar
under your scanner folder.  
  

### Deployment

  1. Build processing jar and infoimage.jar and deploy it to resin/ext_lib_estmt .
  2. Start Resin
  3. JSP changes don't need a deployment make the change and you should see it right away.

  

### Other helpful information

  1. Authorizenet

    * How payments are procesed at Authorize <http://developer.authorize.net/payments101/>
    * <b> Test site account info <b>  
URL: <https://test.authorize.net/>  
Login: lisa_zhang@infoimageinc  
Password: Infoimage3  
answer to secret question : test  
email: [lisa.zhang@infoimageinc.com](mailto:lisa.zhang@infoimageinc.com) ,
[ben.chan@infoimageinc.com](mailto:ben.chan@infoimageinc.com)  
password is valid for about 90-120 days.  
It might ask to set answer to another secret question at some point

    * all payebill clients have an account on the live site(SOW should have this info)  
[https://account.authorize.net](https://account.authorize.net/)  
eg.  Authorize.Net website: <https://account.authorize.net/>  
  Authorize.Net Login: Convergent3434  
  Authorize.Net Password: Password3434  
  Merchant ID: 1055968  
  API Login ID: 92ej8LX9  
  Transaction Key: 24yd73r7nUX8Td4j  
this info is also stored in the paymentvendorurl table  
INSERT INTO PAYMENTVENDORURL  
VALUES (pvu_id_seq.nextval, getOrgId('lbhs'), 'AUTHORIZE',
'com.infoimage.authorize.api', 'mode=live_mode|ennvir=production', '92ej8LX9',
'24yd73r7nUX8Td4j');

    *  _By Request and Autopayments makes use of the CIM module._  When in live mode in production when you add a credit card and profile is created at and saved a authorize's end. This also involves a test transaction of status voided get created on authorize end for an amount of 0 dollars. If you click on this transaction the description would mention something like "test transaction for ValidateCustomerPaymentProfile"  
Exp for this from authorizes site is given below.  
 **ValidateCustomerPaymentProfile**  
This method is used to check a customer payment profile by generating a test
transaction for it. The merchant must be signed up for the CIM service to use
it.  
During creation of the payment profile from within the Merchant Interface, if
"Perform credit card authorization before saving data." is not checked , then
a $1.00 Test Mode transaction will be submitted to verify that the credit
information is in a valid format. This Test Mode transaction does not show on
the customer's credit card statement, but it will generate a transaction
receipt e-mail to the merchant. The test transaction will only verify that the
credit card information is in the correct format--it will not verify that it
is a valid card. To verify the card, you must check the box next to "Perform
credit card authorization before saving data."
