## Goals

  * For Javascript issues related to prism on Internet explorer.

## Background and strategic fit

Some JavaScript functions/methods are not able to run on certain IE versions.
In order to force the latest IE version, we will add a <meta> tag in the
include/header.jspf file.

## Assumptions

  * The client has cookies enabled.
  * The client has the latest version of IE.

## Requirements

#| Title| User Story| Importance| Notes  
---|---|---|---|---  
1| Functional Javascript in IE| Have JavaScript functions work in IE| Must
Have|

  * Add a meta tag in the include/header.jspf  **< meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />** to force IE to default to the latest version

## User interaction and design

Check the emulation in the developer tools to see which document mode (IE
version) the client is using when accessing the eStatement Site. In my use
case, the client's admin site was defaulting to IE5. Adding the meta tag
helped fix the issue.

  * Press F12 and click on the Emulation tab to access the default Document mode. 
  *  **< meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />**
