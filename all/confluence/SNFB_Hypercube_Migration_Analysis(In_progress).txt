### Login methods:

  *  **FISERVSSO  (SingleSignOn7Servlet)**
    * createLogin: true, hasMultipleAcct: true, updateEmail: true, updateMobileNumber: false, linkUFA: true, updateEmailIfExist: false, hasAcctType: true, createAcct: true, createCif: true, loginId: VENDOR_USER_ID, accountDigits: 20, subusers: true, ufaSourceValue: fiservSso
    * Mandatory fields: data, selected_acct, selected_acct_type. For N type users, login_id and user_type(N) is mandatory. Otherwise, the user will be login as subuser.
    * User type N as considered as primary users or vendor users. For vendor users, 
      * compCif=last 9 digit of loginId. combinedCif = compCif|vendorLoginId
      * Check whether this primary user exists. primaryUsers = search from USR_MAPPING by compCif (last 9 digit of loginId) and primary_user_flag is null or not S
      * createCifForSubusers is false. subUser = search userId from usr_session by vendor_user_id (vendor_login_id from sso request) and gets the user from USR table by that usrId.
      * If primaryUsers exists, take the first one as primaryUser **.**
      * user = subuser. [user from USR table]
    * For those users, who are not vendor (user type is not N)
      * user = search userId from usr_session by vendor_user_id (vendor_login_id from sso request) and gets the user from USR table by that usrId. 
    * if user found, search for its login information from USR and USR_SESSION by usrId. If login not found, create login.  
      * For vendor users,
        * login = create vendor login. Create a new user with sess_login_id="!"usrId, permission=1, vendor_user_id=loginId.
      * For not vendor users,
        * login = createLogin. and createAcct = true. Create a new user with permission=1, vendor_user_id=loginId, ssoKey, sess_login_id= "!"usrId, status=New and insert into USR_SESSION.
    * If email is provided in sso file, updates email address in CONTACT_INFO table and insert an entry in AUDIT_LOG_SNFB (location="sso").
    * Updates ufa links.
      * If a new account is provided in sso file,  create a new fa with acctName, acctType (provided in sso file), status=A and current date as last modified. Also insert into paperless. new status=B, old status=N
      * New UFA is created with the newly created fa. Expiration date = Current date, email = from sso file, ufaSource=fiservSso, ufaStatus="pre_reg". Every account is linked with the user with its account type. That means, if we provide 5 account types for the same account, 5 accounts will be created and will be linked with that user as ufa.
      * Searches uat from USR_ACCT_TYPE_MAPPING by usrId,acctId,stmtType="default" and letterType=0. If selected_acct_desc is passed via sso file but no uat found, insert usrId, acctId, stmtType=default and acctDesc. Or if found, update acct_desc.
      * If selected_acct_desc is not passed via sso file, delete that uat (by usrId, acctId) from USR_ACCT_TYPE_MAPPING table. 
      * Removes all leftover ufa links as they are not defined in sso request. Deletes np by usrId and acctId from notification_preference table. Also remove from usr_acct_type_mapping table.
  *  **FISERVSSO2 (SingleSignOn7Servlet)**
