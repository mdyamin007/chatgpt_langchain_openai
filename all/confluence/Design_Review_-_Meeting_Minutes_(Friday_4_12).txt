###  **Meeting Minutes:**

  1. Team walkthru the MFA design doc specification
    * High-level design & implementation discussed & agreed.
    * As per the design, Mule ESB will have 2 REST/JSON API in order to fulfill security-toke generation & validation functionality.
    * The design doc is available on wiki-site describing MFA design & implementation details.
  2. Suggestion raised for the Retry logic check in Mule-ESB Service in roder to keep track of number of attempts during login.
    * It is agreed that web-application team will take care about the retry check during the authentication process. There is no need at Mule-ESB end.
  3. Suggestions by Will for Mule-ESB REST/JSON API to generate the browser based cookies value to web-application (BASE64, RSA or similar algorithm).
    * Not applicable for implementation under Release-1. It can be considered under next release.
  4. SMS delivery thru email: High-level steps discussed for SMS delivery using email with service-provider specific email-id.
    * It is agreed that Release-1 will use SMS deliver thru email. Future release may use SMS Gateway for SMS delivery.
  5. Additional suggestions:
    * DB Transaction table - add one more DB column field e.g. last_modified_date (type timestamp).
    * REST API - add one more input param for the delivery-type (SMS, Email or others), which will be used by the web-application as a delivery indicator for security-token.

  
  

###  **Action Items:**

 **Next Steps:**

  1. Mule ESB Implementation -
