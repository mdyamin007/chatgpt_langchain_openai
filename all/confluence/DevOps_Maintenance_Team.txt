title: DevOps/Maintenance Team
body: # General Responsibilities

  1. System/Service Monitoring and Analytics
    1. Determine the load for services like Hypercube; how many concurrent users can we support?
    2. Track users load. Over the course of a month, how many users access and use Hypercube? When are there spikes in usage (Month's End, but also how much of a difference is the spike)?
    3. What are the load threshold for all the applications? When should we add more servers? Are there inefficiencies in the code we can improve?
    4. How many concurrent GET PDF can we support for Infoservice JAAS?
  2. Security Analysis  

    1. Including (3), but also whether our coding practices/methods are safe.
  3. Packages/Libraries/Softwares maintenance  

    1. When we should upgrade the third-party libraries/packages/softwares that we use across all of our products
  4. Streamline Processes/Internal Tools/Jenkins
    1. Deployment processes, or tedious tasks
    2. Maybe leverage Kubernetes so that we don't need to have all servers running at the same time, but will be able to bring new ones up as demand needs. 
      1. Our business is only busy at certain times. For example, month's end would account probably for 80% (not certain, and this is what the team would also figure out) of traffic, so we should only have a lot of instances up and running around the spikes, and not all the time.
