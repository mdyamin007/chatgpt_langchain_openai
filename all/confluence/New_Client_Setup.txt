## Windows setup

All files are located here  
Dell-2100\ISD\Projects\PayeBill\40-Development\New_Setup_offshore  
  

  

### DB setup

  * Run the payebill setup sql using . 
  * Populate the data which typically PUI process will do 

  

### HOST setup

  * Copy the payebill JSP folder (from codebase tar) provided to C:\hosts folder i.e. C:\hosts\payebill
    * Open the file C:\hosts\cid\msm\WEB-INF\web.xml  
Do not change the following payebill to your cid:  

<context-param>  
<param-name>com.infoimage.dtd</param-name>  
<param-value>d:/hosts/CID/ROOT/dtd/payebill.dtd</param-value>  
<description>The full file path of DTD</description>  
</context-param>

  

If the PayeBill client falls under the Nordis-Convergent umbrella, keep the
following variables the same (used to pull PDF statements from Nordis eXpresso
system):  
nordis.Uname: AH84C  
nordis.accCode: 7f7d9ec3-9744-4cd3-95ee-d5417915daaa  
nordis.CID: 90  
nordis.email: [dsamuilov@nordisdirect.net](mailto:dsamuilov@nordisdirect.net)

        
                Replace nordis.Uname, nordis.CID, nordis. accCode, nordis.email if the PayeBill falls under a different Nordis client. This should be part of the deliverables.  Variables will not be needed    if PayeBill client does not come from Nordis partnership.

  * Same thing as above applies to C:\hosts\cid\ROOT\WEB-INF\web.xml

  
RESIN SETUP

  * Stop your local resin  
Copy payebill service folder to  **resin_location** \conf\service\payebill  
Rename payebill to your CID (e.g. huhs)

  *  **resin_location** \conf\service\huhs\loggin.conf in this file change  
logger.payebill to logger.CID (e.g. logger.huhs)

  * Open resin.xml
    * Add this entry  
copy this part to estmt cluster section in resin.xml

  

 <host id="template" root-directory="*hostlocation*/hosts/template">  
            <host-alias-regexp>.*: 9381</host-alias-regexp>  
                 <web-app id="/" document-directory="ROOT">  
                <access-log path="../log/access.log" rollover-period="1D" />  
                <stdout-log path="../log/stdout.log" rollover-period="1D"   
                    timestamp="[%m/%d/%y %H:%M:%S] " />  
                <stderr-log path="../log/stderr.log" rollover-period="1D"   
                    timestamp="[%m/%d/%y %H:%M:%S] " />  
            </web-app>  
            <web-app id="/msm" document-directory="msm">  
                <access-log path="../log-msm/access.log" rollover-period="1D" />  
                <stdout-log path="../log-msm/stdout.log" rollover-period="1D"   
                    timestamp="[%m/%d/%y %H:%M:%S] " />  
            <stderr-log path="../log-msm/stderr.log" rollover-period="1D"   
                    timestamp="[%m/%d/%y %H:%M:%S] " />  
            </web-app>  
        </host>
    
    
      

  *     * Replace template with cid
    * port number 9381 to your new port number for this client.
    * Make and entry like below to your list of servers in your cluster. Replace port with your value eg. 11861 is the port of huhs  

<http address="*" port="11861">  
                <jsse-ssl self-signed-certificate-name="resin118611@localhost" />  
        </http>

  

### Front End Customizations for the Client

  1. Replace the client-specific Nordis configurations in hosts/CID/ROOT/WEB-INF/web.xml and hosts/CID/msm/WEB-INF/web.xml if the PayeBill client does not fall under the Convergent (CRCM) umbrella. You can reuse the same variables for all Nordis PayeBill set-ups.  
a. nordis.Uname  
b. nordis.accCode  
c. nordis.CID  
d. nordis.email

  2. Email notification content through AI site Email Proofing module 
  3. Client contact information in /msm/include/define.jsp and /ROOT/include/define.jsp
  4. Turn off ACH payments in /ROOT/include/define.jsp if applicable  
private final boolean SUPPORT_ACH_PAYMENT = false;

  5. Set the correct ARCHIVAL_PERIOD in /ROOT/include/define.jsp
  6. Replace logos and color schemes on AI site and Member Site through host-static style sheets. Looking at jsp you can find out where the logo should be placed.  
root/styles/payebill.css is the style she where colors need to be changed as
per the client

  7. Remove "Patient Rights Summary" and/or "Privacy Policy" links in /ROOT/footer.jsp if necessary
  8. Customize enrollment opt-out verbiage. Ex: removed verbiage pertaining to ACH payments if it does not apply.
  9. Put the right sample pdf file in the right location - huhs\ROOT\dso

  
  

### Java Customizations for Client

Some of these files might have already been covered in previous steps.

  1. I3-Core Code  
a. /i3-core/com/infoimage/financial/payment/plan/PlanFactory.java  add your
cid  
b. /i3-core/com/infoimage/financial/payment/plan/CIDPayeBillPlan.java  create
a class for clients payment plan  
c. /i3-core/com/infoimage/financial/payment/vendor/PaymentVendor.java  add
your cid here  
d. /i3-core/com/infoimage/util/security/UserServiceFactory.java. add your cid
here

  2. Processing-UI Code  
a. / processing-
ui/com/infoimage/processing/application/auth/AuthRegistrarFactory.java  add
yr cid here  
b. / processing-
ui/com/infoimage/processing/application/payebill/CustomizedEntryPointFactory.java
 add your cid here  
c. / processing-
ui/com/infoimage/processing/application/accounting2/ReportHandlerFactory.java
 add your cid here

  3. Dp.jar - need to change only when doing production deployment  
a. /dp-dev/dp/com/infoimage/dp/scanner/handler/PayebillFileHandler.java  add
your CID here in the subCids string array. - this is for handling the
automation of file processing when in production.

  4. Infoimage-Commons Code  
/infoimage-commons/com/infoimage/constants/OrganizationEnum.java  add your
CID here

  
  

### Processing-ui setup:

a. If no folder structure has been created on input_dev, please create
"\\\10.8.8.216\input\I3\process-files\${CID}\" and "b.
\\\10.8.8.216\input\I3\process-files-backup\${CID}\".  
b. Copy \processing-ui\conf\payebill.conf to \processing-ui\conf\${CID}.conf
and make customization if needed.  
c. modify "hosts\processing\Root\applications\selectOrg.jsp" to include ${CID}
for processing.  
d. Add an entry for your new client at
"hosts\processing\Root\Report2\select.jsp" for the Accounting Report.  
e. Add you ${CID} to "\processing-ui\schedule\payebill_cid.txt" for payebill
paperless, payebill_preSchPayment and payebill_autoPayment will pick your
client up when release to production.  
f. Release the infoimage.jar and processing-ui.jar and etc.  
  

  

### Scanner setup:

If you have local scanner setup, you can test it locally by replace dp.jar
under your scanner folder.  
  

  

### Deployment

  1. Build processing jar and infoimage.jar and deploy it to resin/ext_lib_estmt .
  2. Start Resin
  3. JSP changes don't need a deployment make the change and you should see it right away.

# OffShore Instructions to bring up a client

All files are located here  
Y:\Projects\PayeBill\40-Development\New_Setup_offshore  
  

  

## DB setup

  * Set up the i3-schema using the ddl provided.
  * Run the payebill setup sql using. 
  * Import the exported data provided

  

## HOST setup

  * Copy the payebill JSP folder (from codebase tar) provided to C:\hosts folder i.e. C:\hosts\payebill

  
  

## RESIN SETUP

  * Copy the resin folder from resin zip to c:  
This step takes care of few things

    * Payebill host in the resin.xml ( search for payebill in resin.xml and you would see the entry)
    * Search for  _< server id="estmt"_ , change the ip address to your machine's ip address
    * Search for  _jdbc/default_  , change to your db settings
    * Search for  _15555_  \- this is the port payebill will be running on if you want you can modify it to yours. There are two occurrences of this in the file.
    * payebill service folder added in C:\resin\conf\service
  * Modify the file "hosts" under the folder "C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\" by adding the following mapping.  
10.x.x.x resin ( this should be your IP where resin is running)

  * Drop the ext_lib and ext_lib_estmt ( part of codebase package) folder into C:\resin\ folder
  * Start resin and look at resin logs to make sure it has started
