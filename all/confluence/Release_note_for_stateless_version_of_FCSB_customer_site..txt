title: Release note for stateless version of FCSB customer site.
body: ## **Objective**

Making FCSB customer site responsive and stateless.

##  **Goal**

Cookie will be used instead of session in the entire application for SSO
login, DSO will still use session. User information (encrypted token) will be
stored in cookie instead of session.

##  **Development**

A filter class has been introduced to do some validation on cookies. Every
request is intercepted by that filter. The filter class checks if encrypted
user information is saved in cookie or not. After validation, it adds
additional information to the cookie and forwards the request to the expected
endpoint.

To support both SSO7(SingleSignOn servlet) and DI login in the stateless
version, there are some changes in the following files:

  1. com.infoimage.security.SingleSignOnServlet.java( ** _i3-core_** )
  2. IFSIBssoexchange.jsp
  3. hblogin.jsp

Also in every page data is fetched from the cookie instead of session.

  * In SingleSignOnServlet.java previously set cookies are being cleared.
  * In IFSIBssoexchange.jsp encrypted user information is being set after clearing the previously set data in the cookie.
  * Also in hblogin.jsp  after clearing the previously set data in the cookie.
  * Sitemesh filter mapping has been added in web.xml file.
  * A new folder named "box" has been added for base layout.
  * Some endpoints are excluded from filter class in ROOT/WEB-INF/conf/decorators.xml

##  **Changed files**

  1. com.infoimage.security.SingleSignOnServlet.java
  2. IFSIBssoexchange.jsp
  3. hblogin.jsp
  4. web.xml
  5. And all other pages have some changes for fetching data from cookies and request instead of session.
