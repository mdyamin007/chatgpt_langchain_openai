  2. Data Migration
    1. Create usr_mapping with member number; using the same usr_id as usr_session
    2. Contact Info -> Notification Preference
    3. Usr Session
      1. sess_login_id -> (exclamation_mark)(user_id)
      2. update SSO date for Disclosure Acceptance (paperless2 if p_latest_status is E)
      3. clear out DSO? 
      4. Not too sure if SSO and DSO actually matter now since they are using Alkami.
    4. Migrate Admin Users into InfoTRAC users
