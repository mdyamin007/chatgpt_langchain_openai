title: ISD - One-Week Sprint Analysis
body: This is an analysis of why implementing one-week Sprint for ISD will benefit
the ISD team and InfoIMAGE (the Organization) as a whole.

# Pros

  1. This will fall more inline with the current work cadence that we have. For a typical two-week project, the work is expected to be pilot-ready around Day 5. When the Sprint is one-week long, Day 5 would be Sprint Review, during which is when we can demo Pilot to the client.
    1. If the client disapproves, the Development Team revise the work in the next Sprint. Then, the client will review the work done again during Sprint Review.
    2. If the client approves, the Development Team can release on Day 5 of the Sprint during which the approval was given.
    3. For cases when the client requires an extended amount of time to review, then at least, the work will be done on pilot, and the task will not remain on the Scrumboard. 
    4. Ideally, we don't need QA for "Staging". The work done should always be Production ready, because QA happens before Sprint Review. 
  2. Most tasks can be accomplished in one week.
    1. The only reason why we need two weeks is because we are assigned several one week-tasks. Split these tasks into two Sprints. 
  3. Faster delivery. We deliver something every week.
  4. Faster feedback. We do smaller pieces of work, but the client can review and provide feedback every week. 
  5. The client is more involved this way. Compare being able to see some pieces of finished work every week as opposed to waiting 3-4 weeks before seeing anything (AND then maybe InfoIMAGE is saying there will be a delay!).
    1. When a client is involved, they are more willing to cooperate with our requests.
  6. For the sake of implementing Scrum, a one-week Sprint allows the team to change the implementation every week instead of waiting till the end of two weeks. Faster iteration means the team will approach an optimal state faster.
    1. This could very well mean that after the very first Sprint, we decide that one-week Sprint is not ideal. 

# Cons

  1. Shorter Sprint.
  2. "More" Sprint Events: planning, review, retrospective
    1. But these events should also be shorter. Less to plan. Less to review / demo. Less to restrospect on. These events should now take 30 minutes or less. Maybe 45 minutes for Sprint Review.
  3. Deliver less work.
    1. But hopefully, it will be the same amount every two-weeks. So if we can deliver 10 items in 2 weeks, we'll just deliver 5 items every week.
