## Goals

  * Add "Email Attach" and "SMS" column to Accounting Summary report (only for DefaultReport Handler)

## Background and strategic fit

DefaultReport handler of Accounting Summary report currently shows the sum of
good, bad and warning as the value of "Email" column. These values are picked
from p_job table. After this implementation, the value of "Email" column will
be picked from p_email_count table. Values of additional two columns i.e.
"Email Attach" and "SMS" will also be picked from p_email_count table.

## Assumptions

  * Two columns will be added to the Accounting Summary section.   

    1. Email Attach
    2. SMS
  * Values of "EMail", "Email Attach" and "SMS" will come from p_email_count table.
