title: PDF Compare Troubleshooting
body: ## Problem

When running pdfcompare.pl, program, the program does not seem to ever end.
Looking at 'htop' system usage, there are still a lot of java -jar
pdfcompare-1.1.62... process running but no CPU usage.  (see example below):

  

  

## Solution

This situation can happen on rare occasions.  I believe this is an bug/issue
within the pdfcompare-1.62-SNAPSHOT-full.jar program did not get responses
within it's own threading logic to compare.  If this situation happens, then
you can disable the threading coding logic for the pdfcompare**.jar program by
defining the enviroment variable 'export parallelProcessing=false'

e.g.:

export parallelProcessing=false; perl
/home/util/[pdf_compare.pl](http://pdf_compare.pl) tkcums1_prod/
tkcums1_parallel/ result_tkcums1 -pixels 18 -threads 16 -maxfiles 500
-exclusion tkcums1.json
