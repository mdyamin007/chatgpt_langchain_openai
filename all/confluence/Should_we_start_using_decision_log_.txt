## Background

Decisions are often made in various channels: Zoom, emails, calls/meetings,
etc. Most of the time, those decisions are not recorded or logged anywhere, so
it is always up to the parties involved to remember. In certain cases, the
parties involve remember different agreements. In other cases, we discuss
multiple approaches, and it's difficult to remember exactly which approach was
agreed upon. The decision log's goal is to log all decisions made, so that
anyone can refer back to the log later.
