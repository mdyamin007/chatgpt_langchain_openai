title: Local Tomcat Server clean-Installation
body: This is a clean-install zip to set up tomcat on your local machines. This
setup mimics what is currently being used on the tomcat systems.

Setup Steps:

 **1.**  Find the "Tomcat-clean-install" folder located in "Z:\Isd\Local
tomcat clean install". Unzip the folder to Desktop or somewhere accessible.

 **2.**  Create a folder ApacheTomcat in your C:\ directory  
 **Ex:**  (C:\ApacheTomcat\\)

 **3.**  Move the folders tomcat-bank, tomcat-cu, and tomcat-default
(tomcat-*\\) into your "C:\ApacheTomcat\" folder

 **4.**  Update file tomcat-*/conf/catalina.properties, "shared.loader=" value
to point to your own local I3-Lib and Estmt Jar locations (all 3 tomcat-*\
folders)  
 **Ex:**  C:/Users/ethyu/workspace/Development/estmt2-depend-libs/*.jar,
C:/Users/ethyu/workspace/Development/_jar_files_dev/*.jar

 **5.**  (Can ignore this step if you put tomcat-* folders into
C:\ApacheTomcat\ directory)  
Update tomcat-*/i3webapps/system.prop "webserver.root", "webserver.config",
"webapps.root", and "com.infoimage.api.configfile" to connect to your local
tomcat directory

 **6.**  Update server.xml to add in your own client. You can follow the
examples of previous server setups commented in the file.  
Copy and paste from <Host> </Host> outside of the comments.  
Make adjustments to the client names, 3 instances.  
 **Ex:**  ("____" will depict the areas you need to replace with client name)  
Lines:  
<Host name="____local.infoimageinc.com" appBase="i3webapps/____" and  
prefix="____-local.infoimageinc.com_access_log." suffix=".txt"

 **7.**  Create your client folder in tomcat-*/i3webapps.  
 **Ex:**  "gcbk" folder  
Move and update the logging.conf file in C:\ApacheTomcat\tomcat-bank\i3webapps
with the corresponding client's CID into code and copy over to the client
folder you made.

 **8.**  Checkout client code from SVN onto your workspace.  
In your eclipse workspace, "Run As 5 Maven install" the pom.xml file in your
client code folder  
Copy over the msm.war and ROOT.war files from the client target folder over to
client folder you created in tomcat-*.  
 **Ex:**  "C:\Users\ethyu\workspace\Development\gcbk\target" \--->
"C:\ApacheTomcat\tomcat-bank\i3webapps\gcbk"

 **9.**  Run tomcat-*/bin/setenv.bat to set the environment path

 **10.**  On your hosts file, add  
 **Ex:**  "127.0.0.1
[gcbklocal.infoimageinc.com](http://gcbklocal.infoimageinc.com)" for each of
your clients

 **11.**  To start tomcat local server:  
Run tomcat-*/bin/startup.bat file
