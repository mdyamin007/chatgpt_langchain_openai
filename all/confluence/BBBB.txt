 **Set up:   **

 **AUTH process** :

Index file : netteller cashManagement ssn firstName lastName accountNumber
appType AcctFullName acctStatus pseudoName

Tables include : usr, usr_mapping, usr_session, fin_account, paperless,
usr_acct_type_mapping, usr_fin_account, audit_log

Logic for deciding active and closed users:

  * A for Active users
  * C for Closed users
  * If appType is D/S and acctStatus is 2/8, it's Closed account
  * If appType is L/O/T and acctStatus is 2, it's Closed account

For any other combination, it's Active account

Other functionalities

  * If new user, checks for active user. If it is active user then it creates new user. If closed, does nothing.
  * If old user, searches ssn, if new ssn found in index file, it updates the usr table.
  * Creates login for new users as cif + "|" \+ cashManagementId.
  * If active user,and pseudoName is present, inserts in usr_acct_type_mapping table.
  * Inserts sess_login_id as !usrId in usr_session table

Logics for inserting stmt types

For apptype A,B,L,T,D,O,S -> enotice

For appType D,S -> default (and enotice)

For appType O -> heloc (and enotice)

  

  

 **Doc process** :  

9If new account, insert in fin_account as an Active user.

  * If old, then updates name.
  * Inserts data in estmt_doc, arch_file, estmt_file, p_job_estmt, p_job_email, paperless table.
