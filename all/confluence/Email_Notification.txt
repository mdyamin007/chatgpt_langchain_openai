body: Steps we need to do to test email notification

  1. Make sure your cid had an entry for the corresponding application method in EmailHandlerFactory
  2. in your cid.conf add following entry  
below line should only be used for testing, it is making sure if any outside
emails go out it only goes to below emails rather than all accounts  
email.allowedEmail=[scorpio.tin@gmail.com](mailto:scorpio.tin@gmail.com),[ignorethisemailisd@gmail.com](mailto:ignorethisemailisd@gmail.com)  
email.etax.needApproval=true

  3. Make sure account you have processed has an email associated to it on the member site. If not create an email address for it.
  4. Make sure your email in email proofing is approved before triggering email notification
  5. Now trigger email notification by going into  
PUI>Email Notification > CID  
Make sure the job you are triggering email notification for has a unique name
and it does not have two many accounts just a few including the one you want
to trigger email for.
