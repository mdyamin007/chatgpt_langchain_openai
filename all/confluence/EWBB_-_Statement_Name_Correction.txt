## Goal:

  * Remove all instances of User/Customer Name from both Admin site and eStatement site.
  * Update email templates to use AcctName instead of UserName so that the email is sent out with the Account Holder Name instead of the User Name.

## Requirements:

  
| Title| User Story| Importance| Notes| Pilot| Production  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
1.| msm| As an EWBB admin, I would like to able to search for an account
information by account number and able to view the account owner name along
with other informations.| Must Have|

  * If that account is associated with multiple account, a list appears where "Account Number", "Application" and "Customer Name" is shown. According to current implementation of EWBB, "user_firstname" appended with "user_lastname" [from USR table] is shown as "Customer Name" . Now, after this update, "account_owner_name" [from FIN_ACCOUNT table] will be shown as "Account Owner Name". "Customer Name" verbiage will be changed to "Account Owner Name". 
  * If a specific account is needed to be viewed, by clicking the particular "Account Owner Name", a page appeares where, under Account Information section, both "Customer Name"(from USR table) and "Account Holder Name"(from FIN_ACCOUNT table) is shown. After this update, only "Account Holder Name" will be visible.

## Changes in files:

Project File Path| Changes| Comments  
---|---|---  
/msm/statements/acctsearch_action.jsp| Take acctName from FinanceAccountBean
and set it to Result object| Previously, userName was passed for showing on
listResult.jsp as Customer Name. Now, passing acct_owner_name for showing as
"Account Owner Name" on lilstResult.jsp page.  
/msm/statements/acctsearch.jsp| Verbiage changed from "Customer Name" to
"Account Owner Name"|  
  
/msm/profile/profile_inc.jspf| Hide Customer Name| Profile_inc.jspf page shows
both "Customer Name"(from USR table) and "Account Holder Name"(acct_owner_name
from FIN_ACCOUNT table). Now, only Account Holder Name will be visible.  
/msm/include/define.jsp| Add "$sdv_txt_acctName" variable to the
KeyWordsOfEmailV2 array| This variable will be used as System Variable in
Email Proofing  
/msm/proofing/preview.jsp| Replace "$sdv_txt_userName" to "$sdv_txt_acctName"|
Will use "$sdv_txt_acctName" on email template preview.  
/ROOT/profile/profile2.jsp| Hide "Name" from "User Information" section. |
Under "User Information" section, user firstName and lastName from USR table
is shown as "Name" . Under "Delivery Preference" section, acct_owner_name is
shown as "Account Holder Name" under each accounts. So, Hiding the "Name" from
"User Information" section.  
  
  

## Out of scope:

### MSM:

On "ACI EB Management" page, we can search users by Organization Id. The
result page shows two columns.

  1. User ID : vendor_user_id from usr_session table
  2. Customer Name: user firstname + user lastname

This update won't affect this page. Here, only user specific information are
being displayed. The First and Last Names are inputted in by the "Create"
function of that management page. So, Here, "acct_owner_name" **won't be
displayed** as "Customer Name".
