# Support

  1. Identification of Resolution Team: It is up to to the Reporter to identify the team capable of troubleshooting / resolving the issue.

# Development

### AC Development

  1. Standard Work: These work are simple and always accepted. They will always fit within a Sprint.
    1. Examples:
      1. Verbiage Change
      2. Disclosure Change
      3. Prism UI Changes
      4. Some Hypercube UI Changes
    2. AC is to be trained to recognize this type of work, the billable hours, and the required deliverables.
      1. AC will change the ticket name to a standard name, e.g. "Verbiage Change" or "Disclosure Change"
    3. Lifecyle
      1. Client request work.
      2. AC identify that this is a standard work.
      3. AC provide quote and specs for deliverable(s) if applicable.
        * There is no release date on the quote. The understanding is that the work will be finished in one Sprint (two weeks / 10 days), but not necessarily in the next Sprint.
      4. Client sign quote and turnover deliverable(s) if applicable.
      5. AC turnover TS ticket to Product Owner.
      6. Product Owner decide when to create a JIRA ticket in the Product Backlog.
        * This can be automated (possibly). The Product Owner will only have to decide when to add the piece of work to the Product Backlog as to not overfill the backlog. 
      7. ISD receive work in Product Backlog.
      8. ISD select work for Sprint.
      9. AC inform the client that work has been selected for development and will be done by the end of the Sprint.
      10. ISD perform work and testing.
      11. ISD turn over to QA.
      12. QA finish.
      13. Sprint Review: Demo to the client the work. If the client accepts, release.
      14. ISD release work. Work is DONE.
    4. There should be a limit of how many of this type of work can be accepted by AC per quarter. 
      1. AC can tell the client, "Yes, we can do this, but you may have to wait till the 2nd quarter". 
  2. Nonstandard One-Sprint-Work: These work tend to be custom, and will need ISD analysis. They can be finished within one Sprint
    1. Examples:
      1. Add alert for fee charge when opting out of paperless
    2. ISD and AC work together to transform these into Standard Work. 
    3. Lifecycle
      1. Client request work.
      2. AC turnover to ISD Developer for analysis  

        * For request that requires a change in the Product, escalate to Product Owner
      3. Discussion with the client may occur to identify exactly what the client is requesting
        * At the end of discussion, ISD should summarize the work to be done for the client and also for internal reference.
      4. ISD provide to AC quote and specs for deliverables if applicable
      5. AC provide to client quote and specs for deliverables if applicable
      6. Client sign quote and turnover deliverable(s) if applicable.

      14. QA finish.
      15. Sprint Review: Demo to the client the work. If the client accepts, release.
      16. ISD release work . Work is DONE.
  3. Nonstandard Multi-Sprint-Work: These work tend to be custom, and will need ISD analysis. They have to be finished across multiple Sprints
    1. Analyze if this should be an Implementation project instead
    2. Lifecycle
      1. Client request work.
      2. AC turnover to ISD Developer for analysis
