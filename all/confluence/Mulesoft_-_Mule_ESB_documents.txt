## Overview

Mule ESB Mule Enterprise Service Bus is a lightweight Java-based enterprise
service bus (ESB) and integration platform that allows developers to connect
applications together, enabling them to exchange data.

  *  **Mule ESB**  is an open source enterprise service bus (ESB) based on Java, which provides a rich set of integration functionality.
  *  **Mule ESB**  enables easy integration of existing systems, regardless of the different technologies that the applications use, including JMS, Web Services, JDBC, HTTP, etc.
  * Key to  **Mule ESB**  is that it allows different applications to communicate with each other by acting as a transit system for carrying data between applications within your enterprise or across the Internet.

Mule ESB has the following capabilities, which include:

  * Service creation and hosting -- expose and host reusable services, using Mule ESB as a lightweight service container
  * Service mediation -- shield services from message formats and protocols, separate business logic from messaging, and enable location-independent service calls
  * Message routing -- route, filter, aggregate, and re-sequence messages based on content and rules
  * Data transformation -- exchange data across varying formats and transport protocols

  
  

#### Best For

  * Application integration
  * Service mediation -- shield services from message formats and protocols, separate business logic from messaging, and enable location-independent service calls
  * Message routing -- route, filter, aggregate, and re-sequence messages based on content and rules
  * Data transformation -- exchange data across varying formats and transport protocols

## Creating Test/Example Mule Application

  * go File -> New -> Project
  * expand Mule and Select Mule Project
  * click Next and set the Project Name to a name of your choice
  * leave/set "Use default Mule distribution" under the Mule distribution section
  * Under sample content, check Add sample project content and select Hello Example
  * click Next and ensure the the JRE System Library is present under the Libraries Tab
  * click Finish to complete project creation

  
  

## Running Sample Application

  * expand the folder of the application you created and expand the conf folder
  * right click the xml file hello-config.xml
  * select Run As -> Mule Server
  * on the console, type any name to test the application
  * click the stop button on the console tab to close the application
  * right click the xml file hello-http-config.xml
  * select Run As -> Mule Server
  * on your browser, go to <http://localhost:8888/?name=Test> Name
  * you should see on the browser, "Hello Test Name, ....."
  * Mule IDE/ESB is fully configured and you can start developing applications which can use the services of the Mule Enterprise Service Bus
