# Integration Overview

    1. Specifications include the API URL, and what information to pass to the API for a successful image retrieval.
  2. InfoIMAGE programs for the integration according to the Check Vendor's specifications.
  3. InfoIMAGE sets up a Check Index File Processing to load the required information for the Check API. The information should come from a data file. What information is required varies from vendor to vendor, but typically, they are: Account Number, Check Number, Check Amount, and Check Date.

# Check Retrieval Overview

  1. InfoIMAGE processes the Check Index File, which is created internally from the Client's data file.
  2. When the User accesses eStatements, the User will be presented with a tab that will present all the retrievable checks, i.e. the checks that InfoIMAGE has data for as a result of the Check Index File Processing.
  3. When the User requests to retrieve a specific check, InfoIMAGE will make a call to the API URL, passing all the required information in the format specificed by the Check Vendor.
  4. If API call is successful, Check Vendor will return the check images. 
  5. Check images will be displayed in a new tab on the web browser for the User to see.
