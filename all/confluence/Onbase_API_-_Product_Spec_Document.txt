#### What is Product?

|

#### Product Overview

Onbase is a product developed by Hyland that host customer's documents
(Statements, Notices, Taxes, and Check Images) and they have an API for third
party vendor like InfoIMAGE retrieve documents.  InfoIMAGE has developed an
API that connect to Onbase's server to get the list of available documents for
each account and also get the individual PDF documents.  This mean InfoIMAGE
will not be archiving any of the documents that are hosted on Onbase side.

On the eStatement portal, many of the features and functionalities remained
the same (SSO, Enrollment, View Documents, etc.).  The only different is that
InfoIMAGE is pulling the documents from Onbase rather then processing and
archiving them on our system.

eStatement Index (Meta File):  Since InfoIMAGE is not processing any
eStatement document, we will need this meta file from client for each
statement cycle that they load to their onbase system.  This is for InfoIMAGE
to figure out which customer will get email notification that new documents
are available for them to view.  See Specification below.
