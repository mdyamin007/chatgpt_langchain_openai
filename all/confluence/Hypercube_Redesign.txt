## User interaction and design

  

  * When user first logs in, they will get a pop up of any unviewed notifications 

  * This is the users dashboard screen that they are brought to when they first log in . 
    * This information boxes on this screen are configurable by the FI in terms of placement. i.e notices at the bottom and newsletter at the top or accounts on the right and notices on the left. 
    * Clicking on a product on the left hand side navigation will bring them to the "Default" account (see admin screenshots)
    * 6 accounts will be shown and can be cycled through utilizing pagination
    * bvanner ads ads the top (location configurable) and on the left (fixed)

  

  * Clicking on an account brings you to the documents page. 
    * Click on the upper lefthand account number will open a dropdown that allows the selection of another account number (within the specific product type)
    * Configurable banner ad and fixed banner on the left

  

  

  * There will be multiple layouts for clients to choose from as a starting template
