title: Navigating a Kanban board
body: Kanban boards are a way to visually organize work into columns known as
"swimlanes." These swimlanes represent a group of statuses from the workflow
and will house tickets as "cards." Each card will contain the most relevant
pieces of information and are a visual representation of the ticket itself.
This allows you to drag and drop tickets to any allowable status changes
without having to click into each ticket to update its status.

## Step-by-step guide

  

  1. Let's take a look at a sample Kanban board. You can see that the swimlanes are "Not Working On," "To Do," "In Progress," etc. These swimlanes represent a generic group of statuses for a given ticket. The cards on the board represent individual tickets. They show the ticket number at the top, a brief description of the ticket,  the important dates to keep track of, as well as the assignee and priority and time spent in each status. Keep in mind, Kaban boards are flexible and allow for a wide degree of customization depending on the need. Please contact your department managers to suggest a change.  
  
  

  2. Clicking on any of the cards brings up the details on the right side. This provides a quick access detail of the ticket if the information you're looking for isn't on the card itself. All the same functionalities and features on the ticket can be access from within the side menu.  
  
  

  3. If all you're looking to do is change or update the status of a given ticket. You can simply drag-and-drop the card to a different swimlane or even to a different status within the existing swimlane.
