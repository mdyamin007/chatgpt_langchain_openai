## Background

Previously on MM3, eStmt stamping always take the image with the highest
priority. This is okay, because it is possible to only have one image.
However, now due to the possibility of different images based on differing
sets of criterias, during the Simulation step, the eStmt stamping logic would
not know which image to use for the stamping.
