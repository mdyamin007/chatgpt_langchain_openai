## Step-by-step guide in Setting Return Mail Processing

Below are the steps to get Product setup for your client

  1. Request Addendum from Celeste to create for internal set up to send to the customer
  2. AM to send Addendum to the client for sign-off
  3. Schedule coding start date with IS; no BA required.
  4. IM to schedule a call with the customer to discuss the overall process and gather the following information:
    1. Estimated number of mail pieces per month
    2. Confirm which applications will be set up for Return Mail; typically it will be all
      1. Need customer to be aware that Taxes will not be part of the setup; the return address for taxes is pulled directly from the IRS format data file
    3. Review current envelopes and/or materials used for each application
      1. If the customer uses preprinted envelopes and/or paper stock with full return address preprinted - check the current inventory and next re-order date with OPS/Gabriel
      2. The return address on the preprinted materials will need to be updated with Newcourse's PO box/address info.
        1. ***Note***: Some customers may want to deplete all current inventory before starting the new PO Box, or some may want to start the order right away which will impact the live date
      3. If 'double window' envelope, InfoIMAGE will require programming to update the return address that is laser printed on the statement/notice
