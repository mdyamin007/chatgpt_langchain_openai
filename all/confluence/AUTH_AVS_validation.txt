 **email: ZIP code validation is not mendatory**

    
    
    From Ben: 
    Just to finish the point, that also means if CID have the zipcode-validation turned on, zip code text box shown, validation happened.  If validation failed, we need to prepare a transaction failed screen with proper error messages.  Please plan to test this negative path.  :)
    
    Thanks.
    
    
    
    From Amjad: 
    Hi Alok, 
    
    Since the zip code will be validated according to CID demand. 
    
    So if the zip code validation is required for any CID only then,
    -- The zip code text box will be shown in the payment/payment source create UI and validate the code in the service site. 
    -- If the zip code validation is successful in the auth,  The actual transaction will take place. 
    
    Thanks

    From Amjad: 
    Yes, The validation success completely depends on the code, The description part is only to have an idea about what the code means. 
    
    Thanks

    I hope the success criteria is based only on the code and not dependent on the text followed by the alphabetical code below. Please confirm.
