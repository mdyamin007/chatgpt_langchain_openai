title: Member Profile Service(eSafetyBox)- State Diagram
body:   

## 1\. Objective Summary

  * The  **eStatement**  and  **eSafetyBox**  applications have identified integration points to use the MuleESB REST Service for the Member profile/account management purpose.
  * The  **eStatement**  and  **eSafetyBox**  applications are in a process of enhancement & build in order to bring the enrollment features covering various states of the request processing like active, in-active, closed.
  * Currently,  **eSafetyBox**  application stores enrollment settings into the database. The eStatement application will redirect to eSafetyBox customized enrollment page (with password) if user is not enrolled, otherwise display eSafetyBox files if already enrolled.
  * It will also collect/display email address for the  **opt-in/opt-out**  features. (display/store email address using the backend database)  
Note: These features & implementation is beyond the scope of the MuleESB
implementation. Mule will publish the REST APIs in order to support the user
account states for the  **eSafetyBox**  application.

 **eStatement**  and  **eSafetyBox**  applications would like to invoke opt-
in/out-out API for given below scenarios:

  1. Member enrolls into eStatements on the Member Site for the first time
  2. Member changes their paperless status through the Member Site profile page ('paper -> e' or 'e -> paper')

  

## 2\. State Diagram

  * Given below diagram describes various states of the user account status in the  **eSafetyBox**  application.

  * Initially, when user registered in the  **eSafetyBox**  application, it will be assigned as  **'INACTIVE'**  status.
  * After going thru the approval process, user account will moved into the  **'ACTIVE'**  status with all the feature enabled.
  * The user account can be  _suspended_  or  _closed_  after the opt-out request. These request will fall under the  **'Suspended'**  &  **'Closure'**  state respectively.

 **Footnote:**

  * A  **state diagram** , also called a  **state machine diagram**  or  **statechart diagram** , is an illustration of the states an object can attain as well as the transitions between those states in the Unified Modeling Language (UML).
  * In this context, a state defines a stage in the evolution or behavior of an object, which is a specific entity in a program or the unit of code representing that entity.
  * State diagrams are useful in all forms of object-oriented programming (OOP). The concept is more than a decade old but has been refined as OOP modeling paradigms have evolved.
