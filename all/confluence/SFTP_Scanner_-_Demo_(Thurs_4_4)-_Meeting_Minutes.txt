body: **Subject:**  Mule ESB:: SFTP Scanner Service - Demo  
 **Date & Time:** Thurs, April 4, 2013 (4:30pm - 6:00pm PST)  
 **Venue:**  Conf Room-1  
 **Attendees:**  Will, David, Peter, Terrence, Ben, Dharmenda and Niraj

 **Agenda**

  * To present & demo the Mule-ESB SFTP Scanner service
  * Misc.

 **Minutes of Meeting**

  * Niraj presented and gave demo for Mule-ESB SFTP Scanner Service implementation.
    * Also, gave overview for As-Is Vs. To-Be Implementation (refer attached PPT having embedded excel file for the AsIs/ToBe process flow).
  * Couple of suggestions shared by the Team:
    * Dashboard to check the current file processing status
    * Retry mechanism and forceful duplicate file run in order to transfer the same file again  
(currently, Idempotent filter protects duplicate file processing and in PUI
application it is maintained under temp_scanner DB table)

    * Client/CID, file-name and checksum mapping - There is another location where mappings are stored. This is required for file identification purpose.
    * Email notification - One per file, one per client having multiple file listing. Also, there is a enhancement request for the set-of-files for given audience (note: The DB schema change may be required to implement this enhancement)
  * Email notification enhancement and PGP file decryption will be taken up under next release (version 2.0)

 **Action Items:**

  1. Dashboard - Provide web-page (MMC console) to monitor the file processing status.
  2. Manual reprocessing - introduce one end-point in Mule workflow for the manual file processing.
  3. Schedule next demo
