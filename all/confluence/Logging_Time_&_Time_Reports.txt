title: Logging Time & Time Reports
body: This page will show you how to log your time spent in both the Epic and
Stories as well as how to view a report of all project's time tracking.

## Logging Time

  1. There are 2 ways to log work.

Issue Detail Page: More > Log Work| Kanban Board: Click on the issue Detail >
"..." button on the right side > Log Work  
---|---  
  
|  
  
  
  
  

  2. A modal will pop up for you to enter in the details. Enter in the time spent in the  **Time Spent** field. You can specify the time measurement in  **w  **(weeks),  **d** (days),  **h  **(hours). So for example, 30h would mean 30 hours and 30w would be 30 weeks. You can also enter in the date you're logging time for in the  **Date  ** **Started** field. Leave the  **Remaining Estimate** at  **Adjust Estimate** so that it will automatically deduct the hours spent from the  **Original Estimate** of the Epic. You may add an optional description as well.  
  
  
  

  3. Once entered, it'll show up in the issues detail page like below. The left image is how it will show up on the Epic. The right image is how it will show up for Stories.

  

Epic| Story  
---|---  
  
  

Epic Hours are shown in the  **Summary Panel** section and will have the
cumulative hours of the epic itself and any stories tied to the Epic.

You can also click the "+" symbol to log hours as well!

## Time Reports  
  

  1. You can find the  **Time Tracking Report  **inside your respective projects on the left-hand menu.  **Reports > Forecase & Management > Time Tracking Report**  

  2. Clicking on the report will give you the following option. I recommend leaving all the values alone but see below for an explanation of the options. Click  **Next**
    * For  **fix version** , choose the version on which you wish to report. The report will include all issues that belong to this version, that is, all issues whose  **'Fix Version'**  is this version.
    * For  **sorting** , choose how the issues in the report will be sorted:
      *  **Least completed issues first**  -- shows issues with the highest  **Estimated Time Remaining**  first
      *  **Most completed issues first**  -- shows issues with the lowest  **Estimated Time Remaining**  first
    * For  **issues** , choose which issues will be included in the report:
      *  **All**  -- includes all issues assigned to this version
      *  **Incomplete issues only**  -- excludes issues which are either completed (i.e. have an  **Estimated Time Remaining**  of zero), or are not time-tracked (i.e. do not have an  **Original Estimate** ).  
Note that issue status does not affect which issues are displayed.

    * For  **sub-task inclusion**   _(note: this will only appear if_   _sub-tasks_   _are enabled)_ , choose which sub-tasks will be included in the report, for all parent issues that belong to this version:
      *  **Only include sub-tasks with the selected version**  -- includes an issue's sub-tasks only if the sub-tasks belong to the same version as the issue
      *  **Also include sub-tasks without a version set**  -- includes an issue's sub-tasks if the sub-tasks belong to either the same version as the issue or to no version
      *  **Include all sub-tasks**  -- includes all of an issue's sub-tasks, regardless of whether the sub-tasks belong to the same version, some other version or no version.  
Note that sub-tasks which belong to this version, but whose parent issues do
_not_  belong to this version, will always be included in the report.  
  
  

  3. The table in the report shows the issues 

    * There are four time tracking fields as follows:
      *  **Original Estimate**  \- The original estimate of the total amount of time it would take to complete this issue.
      *  **Estimated Time Remaining**  \- The current estimate of the remaining amount of time it would take to complete this issue.
      *  **Time Spent**  \- The amount of time spent on the issue. This is the aggregate amount of time that has been logged against this issue.
      *  **Accuracy** \- The accuracy of the original estimate compared to the current estimate for the issue. It is the difference between the sum of the  **Time Spent**  and  **Estimated Time Remaining**  fields, and the  **Original Estimate**  field.
    * If sub-tasks are enabled, the *''*column at the right of the field shows the aggregate time tracking information for each 'parent' issue (i.e. the sum of the issue's own values, plus those of its sub-tasks).
    * The last line of the table shows the aggregate time tracking information for the whole version.

The report also includes two bar-graphs (above the table), which represent the
aggregate time tracking information for the version:

    * The first bar-graph  **('Progress')**  shows the percentage of completed issues (green) and incomplete issues (orange) in this version:  

    * The second bar-graph  **('Accuracy'**  -blue) shows the accuracy of the original estimates.

The length of the  **Accuracy**  bar compared to the  **Progress**  bar
indicates whether the issues in this version are ahead of or behind schedule.
There are three cases:

    1.  _The issues are on schedule with the original estimate._  
The  **Accuracy**  bar is completely blue and is the same length as the
**Progress**  bar above it.  

    2.  _The issues are behind the original estimate (i.e. will take longer than originally estimated)._  
The  **Progress**  graph is longer than the  **Accuracy  **graph. The blue
region represents the original estimated time, and the light-grey region is
the amount of time by which issues are behind.  

    3.  _The issues are ahead of the original estimate (i.e. will take less time than originally estimated)._  
The  **Accuracy**  graph is longer than the  **Progress  **graph. The blue bar
represents the original estimated time, and the light-grey region represents
the amount of time by which the original estimates were overestimated.
