##  **For releasing wrapper service updates for prism to any environment,
following are the steps -  **

  

  1. Stop all tomcats. To shutdown tomcat server, enter the following command - 

                          ` sudo -u tomcat /usr/local/tomcat/tomcat-default/bin/shutdown.sh `

`             (run it for bank and cu as well)   `

            Check if the processes died.

                            `ps -ef | grep tomcat-default`

`             (run it for bank and cu as well) `

             If not, kill it by

                           `sudo kill -9 {process number}`  
                         

         2\. After shutdown, start the corresponding i3-core jar build on Jenkins for the specific environment.

         3\. Add the following line in _/usr/local/tomcat/tomcat-default/i3webapps/api.prop  _

  

                           ` _com.infoimage.apiurl.wrapperService =<http://10.8.9.129:8080/wrapperservice/v1/document/>_`

`            (add this to bank and cu api.prop as well)`

               

         4\. After the Jenkins build and adding wrapper service api url to api.prop,  run the following command on all tomcats - 

  

                           `sudo -u tomcat /usr/local/tomcat/tomcat-default/bin/startup.sh`

  

         5\. After the servers are started, test wrapper service by pulling documents from front end, either from msm or ROOT. You should see **_status : 200  _** on the log file if the document is successfully pulled through wrapper service API.
