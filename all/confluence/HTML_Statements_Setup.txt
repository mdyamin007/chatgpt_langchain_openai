## Processing Requirements (For Print Team)

#| Application Type| Changes to Index File| Notes  
---|---|---|---  
1| Statements|

  * Must use latest  file format.
  * Use 'PDF,HTML' as the PresentmentType field

| AFP file can be converted to PDF or HTML  
2| Enotice|

  * Must use latest  file format.
  * Use 'PDF,HTML' as the PresentmentType field

| This may requires letter code conversion for older clients that still use
binary digit for letter code.  
3| Etax|

  * Need to add 'PresentmentType' field to the current  specification right after 'Zip filename' field.
  * Use 'PDF,HTML' as the value for client with HTML documents other wise use 'PDF' for non HTML clients.

| This new field will be global for all eTax client regardless if they
requires HTML or not.
