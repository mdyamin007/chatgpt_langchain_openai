title: Saving Browser Session on MFA
body: Infotrac can be logged in using login credentials.

If the Multi-Factor Authentication is enabled and the browser session is not
previously saved, the "Dual Authentication" page will be displayed.

After providing the email address and clicking on the "submit" button, a token
will be sent to the email address. To verify the authentication that token
needs to be entered.

  

If the "Save Browser" checkbox is unchecked, then the browser session will not
be saved and Infotrac will not recognize this browser in the future. Therefore
this "Dual Authentication Check" will appear again in the next login.

If the "Save Browser" checkbox is checked then the browser session will be
saved and Infotrac will recognize this browser for some time that will be
specified. Until that time expires, Infotrac will not check "Dual
Authentication".

After this point, Infotrac will redirect the logged-in user to the main menu.

  

  

In case Infotrac fails to save the browser session, an error message will be
shown for few seconds.

  

  

From the "User Management" section "Trusted Browsers" link can be found.

  

  

  

A list of browser sessions saved for a particular user can be viewed from this
link. In the table named "Trusted Saved Browsers", information like when the
session was created, from which device the user used to login, which browser
was used, what was the version of the browser, which OS was used, and what is
the last login time can be found.

  

  

It is also possible to delete a particular Browser Session. If a browser
session is removed, Infotrac will not recognize this browser for that user. A
browser session can be deleted by clicking at "Delete" button at the right. A
pop-up will be displayed for confirmation. The data will be removed if the
"Delete" button is clicked in the pop-up.
