body: 
    From Venu's recap email

Thanks for the time and inputs, as discussed we will start the OpenStack
Implementation project starting after 1st Week of May, before that we will
have teams from both InfoImage and Imaginea engage in getting to the
environment and other details to help design the architecture.

These would be the follow-up steps:

1) Imaginea to send questionnaire to collect information about the
infrastructure and other details

2) InfoImage to figure out whats needed to enable access for Imaginea team to
access machines

3) Imaginea will prepare Architecture and be ready for the first weeks kick-
off, during which we will be proposing the architecture, post sign-off from
InfoImage, it will be implemented.

4) I will setup a another meeting towards end of 1st week May for us to sync-
up. Following the project kick-off we will have Weekly Meetings to review
(which we will schedule later)

Please have Dhamri share his questions on Swift I will have some one from team
help.
