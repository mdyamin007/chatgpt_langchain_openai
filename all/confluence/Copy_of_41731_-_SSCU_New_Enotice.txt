## Goals

  * Add new Enotice code 011-023 for KYCU 
  * Enhance KYCU to use doc_desc table

## Background and strategic fit

Enhancing KYCU to use doc_desc table will facilitate future addition of
eNotice codes for SSCU. KYCU is already using the document email handler which
requires the doc_desc table for the enotice list keyword. This enhancement
will reduce the need for us to update two different places.

## Assumptions

  * KYCU is already using the document email handler which requires the use of the doc_desc table.
