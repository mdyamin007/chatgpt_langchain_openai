  1. Confirm if eTax shares the same paperless status as default statements
  2. Confirm if we are archiving Full membership or Partial membership  
What this mean is when we process the file do we process all accounts or only
e account.  
Full Membership - all accounts  
Partial Membership - only e accounts

  3. Add eTax servelet into /msm/WEB-INF/web.xml and /ROOT/WEB-INF/web.xml
  4. Make sure overlays are embedded  
This is when logo and statement are different pieces and afp2web combines all
of them to a single pdf. That's when you want to make sure everything is
overlayed properly.

  5. Until IS adds the form type into the AFP name, make sure no AFPs get overwritten
    * Work with IS/DP to process one form at a time
  6. Account name/address matches name/address on other applications
  7. Account Number matches eStatement site account number
    * Ask if need to include special prefix or suffix
  8. Archival year links work on eStatement site
  9. Make sure eTax entry in email DB table for Email Proofing
  10. Email notification needs approval? Test MEMBER_NAME and TAX_LIST substitutions
  11. Make sure JSP verbiage has correct months of archival  
This is on the jsp page the lower part of tax page should have some verbiage
with respect to archival this value should be equal to what you have set in
define.jsp

  13. Create Processing Procedures and Checklist for DP
