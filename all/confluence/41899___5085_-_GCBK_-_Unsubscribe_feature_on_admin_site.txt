## Goals

  * To allow the client access to unsubscribe an email in which the account can remain on electronic, while not receive emails. 
  * Create a report in which gets dropped off in the client pickup and automate the report via PUI

## Background and strategic fit

Create an easy way in which the admin users can subscribe and unsubscribe
emails from going out on a user level.

## Assumptions

  * The user must have an email tied to the user or account
  * GCBK's business rule is that a user must have SSO'ed or DSO'ed in such that the disclosure was accepted previously or we have a record of them enrolling. 

## Requirements

#| Title| User Story| Importance| Notes  
---|---|---|---|---  
1| Subscribe/unsubscribe feature| As a user, I want to allow the client to
change the restriction table to subscribe or unsubscribe emails| Must have|

On user or account basis? Dependent on business rules  
  
2| Report to state all the users which are unsubscribed| As a user, I want to
see a list of emails in which we will not send out| Like to have| FTP or on
demand admin report  
3| NotifyPreferenceEmailHandler|  
|  
| In order to use the restriction table, the email handler must have the
capability to support the email handler.  
4| Create the processing application in processing.conf| As a user, I want to
be able to call the new restriction report via the PUI through report
scheduler| Must have|

  * Add restrictionReport processing application in the pui processing.conf and restart.
  * Use the generic restriction report in com.infoimage.processing.application.file.upload2.restrictionReport

  
  
## User interaction and design

 **Example of subscribe/unsubscribe feature:**

 **Conf file changes used in the NotifyPrefEmailHandler.java (processing UI
source code):  **

  1. optoutFeature.enable=true
  2. optoutFeature.statementType=default (need more if selective paperless)
