## Goals

  * Enhance Hypercube to be able to pass the custom ini parameter iniFile to the API in order to override the default ini in the wrapper service.

## Background and strategic fit

Certain clients from Prism has the ability to set ini by statement type
(estmt, etax, enotice). When migrated to Hypercube, we need to be able to
maintain this logic.

## Assumptions

  * ini can only be custom by exactly three primary statement types: estmt, etax, enotice. This means that all stmt types under estmt, e.g. default, loan, mortgage, etc. must share the same ini. 
  * If all three primary statement types share the same ini, the ini can be defined at the wrapper service level instead.
  * The iniFile should be passed iff we are using a custom ini. It should not be passed if we can use the default ini.

## Requirements

  
| Title| User Story| Importance| Notes|  **Pilot**|  Production  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
1| Pass custom ini dependent on statement type to the /statement route.|
Describe the user and what they are trying to achieve|  _Must Have_|

Examples:

"customIni": {

   "estmt": "afp2web_transparent.ini"

}

  

"customIni": {

   "enotice": "afp2web_transparent.ini",

   "etax": "afp2web_transparent.ini"

}

  

If customIni is not defined or if it's not defined for a specific statement
type, pass null.

2| Pass the custom ini from the /statement route to the server functions that
directly calls the API.|  
|  
| Pass along the iniFile parameter|  
|  
  
3| The server functions that directly calls the API should pass the custom ini
to the API if it is not null.|  
|  
| If the custom ini is null, don't pass the iniFile parameter.|
