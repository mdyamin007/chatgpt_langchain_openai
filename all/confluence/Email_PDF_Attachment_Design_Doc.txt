## Business Requirements & Use Cases

ID| Title| Details| ScreenMock| Importance  
---|---|---|---|---  
BRQ-01| Site Module - Password Management|  **Requirement:**  Create new
module to recover and update password for PDF encryption.  
 **Use Case:**  User enters enters new password, DB values should be updated
to reflect new password.| ...| P0-Show Stopper  
BRQ-02| Site Module - PDF Email Attachment Enrollment Status|
**Requirement:**  Create new module to enroll or unenroll from PDF email
attachment. Upon enrollment, a password will be prompted for the user to
enter. This password is used to encrypt all email attachments until changed.
Upon unenrollment, update DB flag to show unenrolled. Unenrolling from email
attachments  **will not**  unenroll them from email notification.
**Enrollment is by user, not account**  
 **Use Case:**  User enrolls email attachment, module prompts users to enter
password and value is stored into DB to be used| ...| P0-Show Stopper  
BRQ-03| Update Email Proofing Module|  **Requirement:**  Update current email
proofing module to create a separate email message for users with email
attachments  
 **Use Case:**  Users enrolled in email attachment will have the ability to
receive a different message from their non-enrolled counterparts| ...| P0-Show

## QA/Test Requirements

ID| Title| Details| Importance  
---|---|---|---  
TRQ-01| User List|  **Requirement:**  Query list of users who are enrolled in
email attachments  
 **Use Case:**  Validate user list from program with manual query generation|
P0-Show Stopper  
TRQ-02| Password Encryption|  **Requirement:**  Query DB to grab password to
encrypt each email attachment  
 **Use Case:**  Validate encryption is done and no data is being shown until
correct password is entered| P0-Show Stopper  
TRQ-03| Error Handling|  **Requirement:**  Catch errors during processing and
at time of sending out email  
 **Use Case:**  Email server rejects email because attachment size is too big.
This will be catch and thrown during processing| P0-Show Stopper
