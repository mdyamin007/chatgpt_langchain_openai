title: Initial Setup Questionnaire
body: Find below questions about network, infra details that are required for
initial planning. Based on the this info, we will have a deployment
architecture prepared.

Please share any info that can helps us understand network infra (ISP
Channels, connectivity between data-centers, routers, firewalls, switches,
hardware LB's, IP-pools, Subnets etc) following are some specific points that
would help us get started.  
  

### Infra Details:

  1. Complete hardware Info of all machines to be used for cloud-setup
    1.  **Controller**
      1. Dual 4 Core CPU 2.0GHZ
      2. 16GB Memory
      3. 1TB storage
      4. 2x 1GB NIC
    2.  **Hypervisor**
      1. Dual 4 Core CPU 2.0GHZ
      2. 32GB Memory
      3. 4.7TB storage
      4. 2x 1GB NIC
    3.  **Swift**
      1. Dual 4 Core CPU 2.0GHZ
      2. 8GB Memory
      3. 1.6TB storage
      4. 2x 1GB NIC
    4.  **Cinder**
      1. Dual 4 Core CPU 2.0GHZ
      2. 8GB Memory
      3. 1.8TB storage
      4. 2x 1GB NIC
  2. IP/Subnet details (Menlo-Park & Dallas DCs).
    1. Menlo Park - 10.10.20.0/24
    2. Coppell - TBD
  3. Do you use NTP, DHCP, PXE? If yes, provide version details.
    1. No, we do not use NTP, DHCP, PXE in the subnet that will be provided for OpenStack installation.
  4. Is there any external hardware or software lb, will need one for fail-over.

  

### Access Setup:

  1. IP-Sec Tunneling for all the accesses, what details you would need from us?  
 **Answer:**  
For Site-to-Site VPN,  
Peer IP Address - Imaginea's VPN device ip address  
Remote LAN - Imaginea's LAN that will access  
Pre Shared key - Y65fg*uurtw  
IKE - 3DES, SHA, DH - group 2  
IPSEC - 3DES, SHA, DH - group 2

  2. We will be using a custom Razor-PXE server, do you foresee any issues.  
 **Answer:**  This will be a sandbox subnet so will not interact with any
other systems.

  3. All the cloud systems should have internet access(to download patches and repo updates) during the setup process.  
 **Answer:**  Yes, all cloud systems will have internet.

  4. How does external access (from internet), local LAN (user desktops) access the apps that will be deployed on cloud-infra.  
 **Answer:**  Apps on the cloud infra can be accessed, from outside by https
and VPN, from inside by routing (currently not in place)

  
  

### Questions for Imaginea:

  1. Do we need to install OS prior
  2. Would we need to configure OS should one need to be installed prior
