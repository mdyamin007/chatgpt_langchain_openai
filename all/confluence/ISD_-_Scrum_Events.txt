body: # Sprint Planning

* * *

## Objectives

The objectives below are listed in order of business and will be addressed in
such order.

  1. Product Backlog Story Point Estimation
  2. Setting of Sprint Goal
  3. Sprint Backlog Creation
  4. Work Assignment for Day 1

## Required Presence

  1. Development Team for all Objectives
  2. Product Owner only required for Product Backlog Story Point Estimation and Setting of Sprint Goal.

### Product Backlog Story Point Estimation

The goal of story point estimation is to measure the size of the Product
Backlog and the velocity of the Sprint Team, i.e. the team has X story points
in the Product Backlog and can finish Y story points per Sprint. The
estimation is done with story points instead of specific time units, because
the estimations are intended to be relative. Using a unit-less value, the
Scrum Team is also less likely to disagree over what exactly the estimation
value should be, e.g. 30 minutes vs 1 hour.

The team will be using planningpoker.com and the Fibonacci point configuration
to perform the estimation.

### Setting Sprint Goal

A Sprint Goal should be established each Sprint to determine the common goal
and direction the Product is incrementing towards. In order to set a good
Sprint Goal, there must be a clear vision for the Product. The Scrum Team
should avoid setting work-based goal such as "Complete all the work in the
Sprint" or multiple Sprint Goals. In the early stages of adoption, this may be
unavoidable.

### Sprint Backlog Creation

From the Sprint Goal, the Development Team pull work from the Product Backlog
to populate the Sprint Backlog with tasks. These tasks will be estimated in
hours. It is important for the Development Team to know how long each task
will take to accomplish for the purpose of creating a reasonable Sprint
Backlog, and Work assignment during Daily Scrum.

### Work Assignment for Day 1

After the Sprint Backlog is created, the Development Team will assign Work for
Day 1 to begin the Sprint.

# Daily Scrum

* * *
