title: SCRUM Example - Hypercube2
body: Product Backlog Request:

  1. Have a working DEMO by the next monthly review
  2. ...

  

During Sprint Planning:

  * Select (1) Have a working DEMO by the next monthly review.
  * Redefine the request into items that can be finished in one Sprint.
    1. Boilerplate front-end/back-end applications that are integrated
    2. Landing page with components that use hardcoded data
    3. Develop backend APIs that allow landing page to call APIs instead of using hardcoded data
    4. Integrate SSO keygen/exchange step
      1. Note here that not ALL sso methods have to be implemented right away
  * Build out the Sprint Backlog according to the Sprint Goal (though it is possible that the Backlog is built out first before the Sprint Goal is decided - things can be in flux as the team discuss and plan). Each story should be accomplishable within one day or less.
    1.  **Sprint Goal 1** : Setup system.  

      1. Setup backend Sprint Boot skeleton.
      2. Create the healthcheck endpoint for backend.
      3. Setup the frontend Vue skeleton.
      4. Create Axios boilerplate.
      5. Create the healthcheck endpoint for frontend. (This will call the downstream healthcheck of the backend, and thus confirming that both applications can be integrated via API)
    2.  **Sprint Goal 2** : Landing page with components that use hardcoded data
      1. Component A
      2. Component B
      3. Component C
      4. Component ...
      5. Landing Page Template

During daily scrum:

  * Team members select stories to work on, and report on progress and/or any blockers.
  * The team will assess progress overall towards the Sprint goal, and react accordingly if the goal cannot be met.

  

Renegotiation with Product Owner when goals cannot be met:

  * The team conclude that having a working DEMO is not achievable (this should be determined as early as possible).
  * The team will discuss with the Product Owner, and through renegotiation, define a different Product Goal.
    1. Instead of a working DEMO, we will demo a set of components instead. 
  * The team should reflect on why the original agreed on goal was not met (Sprint Retrospective is the event to do this).

  

If the team finishes stories faster, then renegotiation can also happen to
take on additional work within a Sprint.
