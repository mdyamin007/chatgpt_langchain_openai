title: Jira Suite Utilities(JSU) Automation
body: ## Workflow/Status Triggered Automation

  * JSU automation only works when a status of any Jira ticket is changed from one to another. We can trigger the pre defined post functions of JSU to achieve our goal to automate Jira workflow.
  * Some of the post functions we're going to use are: 
    *  **Create A Linked Issue(JSU)**
    *  **Copy value From Other Field(JSU)**
    *  **Linked Transition(JSU)**

Transition

| Copy fields from source to destination| Notes  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
1.| Auto create linked issues and auto populate some of the field values from
Epic to the linked ISD ticket.| Client facing team will create a ticket in
Implementation project, and then trigger a particular status/workflow
transition, which will lead the JSU post function to create a linked issue in
ISD project. |

 **Create Linked Issue(JSU).**

We need to configure the following fields in this post function:

  *  ** _Target Project:_  **ISD, IS
  *  ** _The new issuse will be related via:  _** Ticket will be a story within the epic
  *  _ **Issue Type:**_  Story
  *  _ **Configure Fields:**  _ CID, Customer Target Live Date, Estimated Dev Hours (ISD and IS respectively), Parallel Required, Pilot Date, Proposed live Date (ISD/IS respectively), QA Date (ISD/IS Respectively), Sample/Pilot Date (ISD/IS respectively), Summary, TeamSupport#, Turnover Date (ISD/IS Respectively)

| Epic - Issues in Epic|

Create IS Ticket, Create ISD Ticket

  

|

See Post Function columns in Configure fields

  

|

  * We will create an Epic in Implementation(IMP) project and provide all the necessary fields such as Cid, Pilot Date, Due Date etc. 
  * After creating this IMP ticket, there will be a specific status in the IMP workflow. If we switch our workflow into this specific status, "Create Linked Issue(JSU)" post function will be triggered and an Issue in ISD project will be created and automatically linked with this Epic. Then the issue's necessary fields such as Pilot Date, CID etc will be copied over from the Epic. 

  
2.| Auto Sync field values to the linked tickets from Epic| Client facing team
will update one or more field values and then trigger a particular
status/workflow transition which will lead the JSU post function to update the
values to all of the linked issues in ISD project.|

 **Copy value From Other Field(JSU).**

We need to configure the following fields in this post function:

  *  _ **Issue Relation:**_ On which related issues we want to synchronize/update the field values
  *  _ **Perform As User:**_  
  *  ** _Copy Field:_** See Auto Create rule fields, sync as needed

| Epic - Issues in Epic|

Sync Status

  

|

CID - _**CID**_

Pilot Date - _**Pilot Date**_

Perform As User: _**Need feedback**_

(Add fields which should be  updated in IMP  and  synchronized in ISD project)

|

  * We will update some field values to the Epic of IMP project i.e. Pilot Date, CID etc. 
  * After updating is done in IMP project, we will trigger a status in IMP workflow and all the updated values will be automatically synchronized and updated to the all linked issues.

  
3. | Automatically close parent issue when all sub-tasks are done| Set the status as "Done" to sub-tasks. | ISD| ISD| 

 **Linked Transition(JSU).**

We need to configure the following fields in this post function:

  *  _ **Trigger transition on all issues related as:  **_ Where do we want to configure the post function. Wheather it is the sub-task or parent task. 
  *  _ **Transition:**_ On which status do we want to trigger this post function
  *  _ **Perform Linked Transition as User:**_ Role of the user who is performing this post function.
  *  _ **Resolution:**_ What would be the resolution of the ticket after performing this post function.
  *  _ **All other sibling issues must have one of the following statuses:**_ Here we check the status of all the other related/linked issues of the parent. If we trigger this post function on child issues, we must have to ensure that, the parent ticket will be set to "Done" only when each and every subtask 

| Parent-Sub-tasks| Done| N/A|

  * If a Issue has sub-tasks, after setting "Done" to the each sub-tasks, status of  parent Issue will be automatically set to "Done".
  * If any of the sub-tasks are not set to "Done", Parent issue will not be set to done. That means, we must need to close each and every sub-task to automatically close the parent task.
