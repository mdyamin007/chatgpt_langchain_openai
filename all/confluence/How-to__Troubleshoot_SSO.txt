body: # Relevant Information

* * *

Information| Relevance  
---|---  
Unique User Identifier (UUID)|

This value can be used to search in the eStatement logs.

This value can be used to query as the cif_num in the usr_mapping table.  
  
Email Address|

This value can be used to search in the eStatement logs.

This value may be used to query the table that stores email address for the
client, which will lead to the user.  
  
Account Number(s)|

This value can be used to query the fin_account table to find all joined
users.

This value can be used to validate that the user found by other methods is the
correct user, i.e. the user is linked to the accounts reported by the client.  
  
Time of Occurrence| This value can be used to narrow down where to look in the
logs, and/or audit data tables.  
  
  

# Relevant Data Tables

* * *

## eStatement Database

Table| Relevance  
---|---  
USR_MAPPING| Used to search for the user by UUID. Non-existence may indicate
an issue.  
FIN_ACCOUNT|

Used to search for the account(s). Non-existence may indicate an issue.

If the client has account type, the wrong account type may indicate an issue.  
  
USR_FIN_ACCOUNT| Links user to accounts, which is useful for research.  
  
NOTIFICATION_PREFERENCE  
USR_FIN_ACCOUNT  
CONTACT_INFO

| Contains the email address that can be queried.  
PAPERLESS2| Delivery preference may affect whether the user can access
eStatement.  
USR_SESSION|

Contains last login date.

Contains enrollment status (SSO and DSO).  
  
LOG_RECORD|

Contains sso action, and view statement action.

Existence of view statement action after the reported time of occurrence may
indicate that the user is no longer affected by the issue.  
  
AUDIT_LOG_(CID)|

Audit log for the specific CID. Stores various action relating to the user and
account.

This can be used to research changes to certain values like paperless status,
email address, or user-account relationship (addition/removal of ufas).  
  
EXT_ACCT_TYPE_MAPPING| Mapping from external types passed in the SSO request
from the OLB to internal InfoIMAGE account types. This is typical for clients
who have OLB with NCR.  
  
  

# Services/Applications/Processes

* * *

Name| Relevance  
---|---  
Hypercube|

Hosts the eStatement Site for Hypercube clients.  
  
Prism|

Hosts the eStatement Site for Prism clients.  
  
Infoservice| Handles the backend operations for Hypercube clients.  
Proxy| Proxies the external requests to the Hypercube/Prism applications.  
Oracle DB| The eStatement database stores the relevant processes.  
MongoDB| Some issues may be due to missing data in the PN_ClientProperties
table, under the specific CID.  
  
Auth File Processing

Enrollment File Processing

| For SSO that relies on InfoIMAGE ingesting data from the client, these
processes handle the creation and updating of data. The data provided by the
client may be incorrect, or a bug may exists in the process.  
  
  

### Common Issues

ssoKeyGen Failure

  

### Situation:

  1. Failure during SSO KeyGen.

### Potential Issue:

  1. Missing data hash.
  2. Missing email address.
  3. Data Hash is incorrectly constructed.
    1. Wrong password.
    2. Wrong client code, if applicable.
  4. Wrong URL (using Production for Pilot or vice versa).
  5. Site certificate has expired. Client need to provide a new certificate to Network.
  6. URL is not available for external clients. Network will need to update DNS.
  7. For clients where user-account relationships is defined solely by a PUI process (Auth/Enrollment), the user may not be in the latest file, or the latest file is not yet processed.
  8. Clients may have some sort of mapping that is not functioning as expected, potentially due to incorrect SSO Data or missing data in the mapping file (PUI processed).
    1. Mapping Account 1 to Account 2 (most likely ext_id_mapping)
    2. Mapping Account Type A to Account Type B (ext_type_mapping table or FinAcctDesc object for some Prism clients)
    3. Mapping CIF A to Account 1, 2, 3 (most likely ext_id_mapping)

ssoExchangeFailure

  

### Situation:

  1. Failure during SSO Exchange.

### Potential Issue:

  1. Wrong URL.
  2. URL is not available for external client. Network will need to update DNS.
  3. Issue is actually with ssoKeyGen, which did not return a key. However, OLB is blindly taking the error page returned by ssoKeyGen and passing it as a key.
  4. Site certificate has expired. Client need to provide a new certificate to Network.
  5. User is not linked to any accounts. 
    1. createAcct is false, and the list of accounts provided by the OLB currently do not exist in the database.
      1. Issue may be with PUI process, or the user/account is newly created, and InfoIMAGE hasn't processed any data yet.
      2. Issue may be with the SSO KeyGen Request itself.
        * Is the OLB sending the correct account types?
        * If there are account type mappings, is the OLB sending account types that InfoIMAGE does not have a mapping for?
  6. User does not exist.
    1. createUser is false, and the CIF_NUM provided by the OLB currently do not exist in the database.
      1. Issue may be with PUI process, or the user is too new and will be processed in the next file.
