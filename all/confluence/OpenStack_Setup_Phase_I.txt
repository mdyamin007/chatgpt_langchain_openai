title: OpenStack Setup Phase I
body: After spent a couple of months studying about the private cloud setup
technology and tried a couple of installation/setup, the team have come to
following consensus to have Imaginea to help do the initial setup (provided
their cost is within budget):  
  

## Reason that we need to involve third-party vendor to help do the initial
setup:

  1. We have spent significant time on researching the technology and combination ourselves. The current progress is only able to setup dev-stack instance of openstack only. Don't have enough knowledge on how to setup the production version of openstack.
  2. The easy version of openstack setup via FUEL is only on older version of openstack 'grizzly'. We need the newer version 'Havana' in order to get the network side of functionality.
  3. If we can manage the cost of vendor within small budget and able to get the initial setup done, the cost saving we gain over development setup would probably cover the cost of vendor setup already.
  4. We are going to have internal staff trained on the openstack setup and maintenance. So that internal staff can handle the production environment setup.

  
  

## Conceptual Architecture of OpenStack

  
  

## Scope for the development environment setup that Imaginea should help us
do:

  1. OpenStack version: Havana, let's use the conceptual architecture diagram as reference.
  2. Datacenter coverage: CA & TX. That is TWO.
  3. All Components shown in the arch diagram need to be included. Priority should follow: Horizon, Keystone, Nova, Cinder, Swift, Neutron, Glance, Ceilometer, Heat.
  4. Hardware that we plan to deploy the following per DataCenter (i.e. CA and TX) as starter:
    * 2 Xen servers to house VMs
    * 2 servers housing Horizon, Keystone, Nova, Neutron, Ceilometer, Heat
    * 1 server w/ 3+ HD each to house Swift, Cinder, Glance (OR potentially reusing existing SAN server)
  5. InfoIMAGE will be responsible to setup 1-2 applications in the VMs as active-passive between CA & TX. Imaginea to help setup auto-failover.
  6. Similarly, InfoIMAGE will be responsible to setup 1-2 applications in VMs as active-active between CA & TX. Imaginea to help setup load-balancing.

  
  

## Items considered out-of-scope in current phase:

  1. Application specific setup. e.g. Hadoop, IIS, FTP server, etc. We just want to have Imaginea to help setup the infrastructure at this point. Application specific setup/migration require more development effort before it can materialize. Once infrastructure is ready with VM instances, InfoIMAGE will be responsible to setup applications inside VMs. Imaginea only need to help setup an VM image of Ubuntu 12.04 LTS as starter, and educate InfoIMAGE network team on Glance operations for snapshot create/restore.
  2. Application/Software Migration & Dev Ops not necessary at this point as we are focusing on our internal development environments only.
  3. Environment automations across dev/test/prod not necessary at this time.
  4. Testing should be limited within internal staff on VM usage by developers and Network administrations mainly. No load-test/usability test expected in current phase.

  
  

## TBD items:

  1. PaaS is something we would potentially pursuit in future and need to ensure the infrastructure we set at this time will support that when it comes.
  2. Openstack being hypervisor agnostic, can it work with XenServer and Docker in parallel. Knowledge of Docker might become imperative due to PaaS implications and its provisioning VM's with app server instances.
    1. More research should be done (by Imaginea/InfoIMAGE) around what solution approach this should be. While HEAT handles the deployment template from application perspective and is integrated with Ceilometer to support auto-scale. It might be sufficient for InfoIMAGE's need on PaaS.
