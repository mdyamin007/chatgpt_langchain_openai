    * Processing UI Workspace set up
      1. Open an empty eclipse workspace
      2. Import psf(project settings file) file into your workspace (the psf will be checked into a location in SVN when it is ready)  
  

      3. This will automatically import all the required project for PUI to be checked out into your workspace  

      4. Do a maven build of the projects in the following order  **afp2pdf,i3-core,processing-ui,dp,processing**. This is because each successor is dependent on the previous one.
        1. to do a maven build eg. for afp2pdf project
        2. Open dos prompt to the workspace location of afp2pdf location. This location should contain the pom.xml file.
        3. Now do a "mvn install". This will clean, compile, run tests if it exists, build the package and install it to your repository. You would a version of afp2pdf jar get installed to m2 repository.As shown below
