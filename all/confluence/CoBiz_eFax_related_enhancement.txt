title: CoBiz eFax related enhancement
body: ## eFax related changes at notifyservice

1\. Add following property to notification.properties

>
> [fax.to](http://fax.to).address=[faxback@mailerserver.com](mailto:faxback@mailerserver.com)
>

>> This should be the email address to send email to the fax mailerserver.

2\. For fax type notification subject line will be generated on the fly while
processing CSV file (Format : /fax=${recipientPhoneNumber}).

> Fax server pulls efaxes from this address inbox  
> Subject line: /fax=faxnumber- This is the way to put in the subject line for
> the fax server to dial the client fax number, example: /fax=5035975317  
>  **But we are still missing the spec on how to populate the actual subject
> line with value, in addition to this fax number.**

3\. To address of the fax type email notification will come from the
[fax.to](http://fax.to).address property.  
4\. Attachments can be added as the same way we can add attachments with the
email notification.

> Attachments adding variable descriptions are followed.
>

>> sdo_attach_{variableName} = With this variable type we can directly add
attachment file link, this link may contains sdo_txt_/udo_txt_{variableName}
type variable. There are two way to give URL.  
> Example:
>>

>>> 1\. Add URL as column header:  
>
> sdo_attach_stmt=<http://internal.afp2web.server/get_stmt?account_num=${sdo_txt_acctnum>}  
> This total line is a column header, rest of the column is empty. From this
> column we will pick the URL, replace sdo_txt_/udo_txt_{variableName}
> variable's value of the URL.  
> 2\. Also you can give URL as column value.

> > sdo_txt_{variableName} = Contains value which be used to replace variable
> attachment URL  
> udo_attach_{variableName}  
> udo_txt_{variableName} = Same as sdo_txt_{variableName}  
> udo_attach_{variableName} = Same as udo_txt_{variableName}  
> Ref :

## eFax related changes at templateservice

1\. Validation added for "fax" type template

> a. fromEmail and fromName can not be null/empty and it should be valid email
> address.  
> b. Sample recipient can be phone number  
> c. subject can be null/empty
>

>> As we replace subject line with "/fax=recipientPhoneNumber" before sending
notification from notifyservice.

>
> d. content of the template can only be plain-text
>

>> Because through the testing, it appears like any style will just get
stripped out after receiving the fax. According to decision accepting plain-
text only would make sense.
