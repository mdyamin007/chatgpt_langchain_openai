body: **Obtain  ** **Backup**

  1. Use thinBackup to generate a full backup
  2. Zip the backup
    1. zip -r foldername.zip foldername

    2. To exclude the build history: rsync -av -progress backupfoldername . --exclude */builds
  3. Move the zip to /var/jenkins_home/backups on the  **setup  **server.
    1. the path can be different depending on where we want to put the backup; if the backup path is changed need to change docker-compose.yml file and configure Jenkins thinBackup to point to the new path

 **Setup**

  1. Install Docker/Docker Engine/Docker Compose
    1.  <https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/>
    2. <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/>
  2. Pull the base jenkins image
    1. sudo docker pull jenkins/jenkins:lts
  3. Build docker image
    1. sudo docker build -f /path/to/Dockerfile . (The period is part of the command)
  4. Tag docker build
    1. sudo docker build -t infoimageinc/jenkins:1.0.0 -t infoimageinc/jenkins:lts . (The period is part of the command)
  5. Start the container with the docker compose file
    1. sudo docker-compose up -d
  6. Enter the container
    1. sudo docker exec -u 0 -it jenkins /bin/bash 
  7. Obtain the initial admin password
    1. cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword
  8. Open up jenkins at https://ip.ad.r.ress:8080/jenkins
  9. Go through the setup wizard
  10. Go to Manage Jenkins -> Manage Plugins
  11. Install thinBackup without restart
  12. Go to Manage Jenkins -> thinBackup
  13. Set up the backup folder to
