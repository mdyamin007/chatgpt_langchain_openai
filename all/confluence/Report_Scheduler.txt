## Development Information:

All the Host files are located in
C:\resin-4.0.20\webapps\processing\ROOT\schedule. The files that are used for
this application are:

  1. reportScheduleAction
  2. reportScheduleConfirm
  3. reportScheduleCreate
  4. reportScheduleDelete
  5. reportScheduleDeleteConfirm
  6. reportScheduleEdit
  7. reportSchedulerIndex
  8. reportSchedulerList
  9. reportScheduleRun
  10. reportScheduleRunConfirm

To run the auto scheduler following lines need to be added in the
**processing.conf** (C:\processing-ui):  
 _ **// processing: reportSchedule  
reportSchedule.desc = Report Schedule  
reportSchedule.classPath=com.infoimage.processing.application.reportScheduler.ProcessingJob  
reportSchedule.jobStatus=false  
reportSchedule.undoable=false**_

and run the bat file named  **reportSchedule.bat**  :

    
    
    call exec.bat reportSchedule action:exec orgName:InfoIMAGE userName:system
