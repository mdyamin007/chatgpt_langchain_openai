title: For template asset library files upload to S3.
body: For asset library files upload to S3 we have implemented the APIs at
infoscanner and templateservice as you said.

1\. Infoscanner same the file with unique UUID.  
2\. After the scanner scan the file, infoscanner call the templateservice API
with that file, UUID and file extension.  
3\. templateservice will upload the file to S3 with publicly accessible flag
and the file extension as the postfix of the S3 object identifier name.

With the bucket name, folder name, cid, file UUID and extension one can make
the file URL easily.

Example:

Bucket name : inforeach-dev  
Folder Name : resources  
Client ID : demo  
UUID : 0720da70-ecb8-11e6-a888-4e5fc6464f15 (will get from API after a
successful file upload)  
Extension : jpg (case sensitive)

Then the URL will be -

<https://inforeach-
dev.s3.amazonaws.com/resources/demo/0720da70-ecb8-11e6-a888-4e5fc6464f15.jpg>
