  * hudson installation on Ubuntu  
\- hudson was installed on pf-tools.  
\- instructions followed as in this page <http://wiki.hudson-
ci.org/display/HUDSON/Installing+Hudson+on+Ubuntu>  

    
            on shell window run following commands one by one
        sudo sh -c "echo 'deb http://hudson-ci.org/debian binary/' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hudson.list" 
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install hudson
    

  
\- you need sudo access to run the commands above  
\- once installation goes through hudson automatically starts up in it's own
container. If port 8080 is not being used up it will start up successfully and
you should be able to hit on that machine  
eg. pd-tools:8080.
