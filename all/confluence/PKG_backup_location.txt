title: PKG backup location
body:   

  

  

  

We have introduced a new property named **pkg.backup.path** which is
responsible for pkg file backup location.

We have to mount the path from docker compose file. Here is the example from
dev

    
    
    pkg.backup.path=/usr/local/tomcat/pkg/file/backup/

Docker compose mount should be like below for dev\

    
    
    volumes:  
    - "/usr/local/tomcat/pkg/file/backup/:/usr/local/tomcat/pkg/file/backup/"  
      
    

## Release Note:

We have a mounted location **download** (<http://ca-ftpbu-
pr-01.infoimageinc.com/download>) which is responsible for these type of task.
in ca-jobtrack-pr-01, the path is already mounted. So we have to create a
folder named **uspsscanservice** and add the property file in the repo like
below.

    
    
    pkg.backup.path=/d/FTPBU/download/uspsscanservice/

We also add the path into docker-compose path like below

    
    
    volumes:  
       - "/d/FTPBU/download/uspsscanservice/:/d/FTPBU/download/uspsscanservice/"  
      
    Currently ca-jobtrack-pr-02 is not mounted with FTBU and download. We have to mount those path first and then have to deploy this changes. Becaus after MQ implementation, both the instances will use those mounted path.
