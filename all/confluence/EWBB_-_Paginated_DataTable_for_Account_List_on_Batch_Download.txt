## Goals

  * Improve the user experience (see image below)

## Background and strategic fit

Client request.

## Assumptions

  * Account number 5500000162 can be used to search on Admin Site Pilot for the example of a user with 1000 accounts like above.

## Requirements

  
| Title| User Story| Importance| Notes|  **Pilot**|  Production  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
1| Msm BatchDownload| As an EWBB Admin User, I would like to be able to search
for and select accounts with Batch Download easily. |  _Must Have_|

  * Paginated DataTable to store the list of all accounts that the user can search by account number and/or Description; and then be able to select the accounts that they have searched.
  * A view like in  (see image) would also be good. We won't change the UI that drastically, but UI between account type and the statements view in the image can fit where the Account List currently is. The advantage of this, I think, is that the user will be able to see all of their accounts grouped by Account Description, so we won't have to display the Account Description next to the account number like in the image above.
