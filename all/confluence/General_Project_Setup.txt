title: General Project Setup
body:   1. Make sure you have maven installed
  2. pom.xml,maven folder(containing batch script) and thirdPartyLib folder should reside in the  **same level as build.xml**
  3. POM.xml contains all dependencies - internal and external (common repository) ** all internal dependencies were placed in thirdPartyLib folder within the project ** all external dependencies were automatically download to .m2 repository (default for maven) eg. C:\Users\jchacko\\.m2)
  4.  **Maven command line**  
Open cmd in Admin Mode  
Navigate to 13-core folder in your workspace ( remember to refresh to get new
changes)

> mvn clean  
> mvn compile  
> mvn install OR mvn -Denv=local install (local profile is used by default if
> not provided)  
> mvn _Denv=dev install (currently this profile has been configured
> completely)

  1. /i3-core-dev/i3-core/maven/*ServiceCmd.bat* is invoked in the install phase (refer to pom.xml)  
This batch job currently takes 5 parameters these values are set in the
corresponding profile.  
All what the batch job does is stops corresponding service, restarts it and
creates a link to the new jar.

5 parameters are :  
arg 1 > estatment service environment  
arg 2 > service name  
arg 3 > resin jar location  
arg 4 > location where all maven created artifacts(jars) get copied to  
arg 5 > newly created artifact name

\---  **MATERIAL BELOW IS OUT DATED BUT WANT TO HOLD ON TO IT FOR SOME TIME**
\----

1) Created Maven Project, moved  **I3-core**  to it in the respective maven
folder  
%{color:red} - we need a way to overide the default location %  
2) Updated POM.xml with all dependencies - internal and external (common
repository) ** all internal dependencies were placed in thirdPartyLib folder
within the project ** all external dependencies were automatically download to
.m2 repository (default for maven) eg. C:\Users\jchacko\\.m2)  
3) Tested Resin with jar created by Maven. Did a quick test of Payebill Member
and AI site  
4) Symlink created for infoimage.jar in C:\resin-pro-4.0.20\ext-lib-estmt\\.
That way for different versions of the jar we can create different symlinks.
Main purpose we don't have to touch resin lib directory.

> mklink C:\resin-pro-4.0.20\ext-lib-estmt\infoimage.jar
> C:\history_lib\infoimage-1.0.jar

5) Using profiles ( you will see the jar gets copied to two different
locations depending property value being passed

> mvn -Denv=local install  
> mvn -Denv=dev install

6) Command line commands to start and stop resin services on windows  
net stop service-name eg. net stop _Resin-estmt  
net start service-name eg. net start _Resin-estmt

> net stop _Resin-estmt  
> net stop processingwrapper (pui)  
> net stop processingstationwrapper (pui)

> net start _Resin-estmt  
> net start processingwrapper  
> net start processingstationwrapper

> runas /user:script "C:\apache-maven-3.0.4\bin\mvn install"
