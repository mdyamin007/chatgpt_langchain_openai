title: Setting up Tomcat Manager
body: # Configurations

  1. Move webapp context from the server-level to host-level 
    * Remove context declaration in ${CATALINA_HOME}/conf/ **server.xml**
    * Create ${CATALINA_HOME}/conf/Catalina/${HOST_NAME}/ **msm.xml  **and ${CATALINA_HOME}/conf/Catalina/${HOST_NAME}/ **ROOT.xml**
  2. Enable the Tomcat Manager per host
    * Create ${CATALINA_HOME}/conf/Catalina/${HOST_NAME}/ **manager.xml**

 **Sample host XML config directory**

 **manager.xml content  **

 ****

Note that this requires the manager webapp folder to be at
${CATALINA_HOME}/webapps/manager, which will be true for default Tomcat
installation.

 **ROOT.xml content  **

 **msm.xml content**

 ****

  

A copy of **manager.xml** ,  **ROOT.xml** , and  **msm.xml** are stored at
/usr/local/tomcat/master-conf. When copying these files, do so as the tomcat
user; or make sure to run chown and chgrp on the copied files to change
ownership to tomcat.
