title: PROV SSO
body: PROV sso is unique and cannot be done through the SSO Test Page. Below is the
instruction on how to perform the SSO with PROV.

## Step-by-step guide

  1. [Setup local Tomcat](https://confluence.infoimageinc.com/display/JP/Local+Tomcat+Server+Installation+Instructions).
  2. Before building the war files for PROV, revert hblogin.jsp to the revision BEFORE the TLS 1.2 update (locally, DO NOT COMMIT).

PROV SSO requires connection to an external URL to perform the handshake. We
mock this by hosting a dummy site on ca-pui-dv-01. However, because of the TLS
1.2 update, it is required that connection to this external URL be done via
SSL. The connection to ca-pui-dv-01 is not secure, and thus the SSO cannot be
performed. This is why it is necessary to revert the file back to before using
TLS 1.2.

  

  3. Build PROV war files and set up PROV in the local tomcat-default.
  4. Add local host entry for the PROV DNS, e.g. "127.0.0.1 provlocal.infoimageinc.com"
  5. Startup Tomcat.
  6. Create a local HTML file with the code below.

xmlPROV SSOtrue

  

  7. Open the HTML file.
  8. The preloaded information can be used to trigger a successful SSO.

Chrome may complain about "Insecure Access". Try Firefox if that happens.

  

## Using Information other than the Preloaded Data

  1. The SessionId is a value that comes from the VENDOR_USER_ID column in the USR_SESSION table. Find one in the database, or insert a value into the column for a PROV usr_session.
  2. Edit on ca-pui-dv-01.infoimageinc.com: /usr/local/tomcat/tomcat-processing/i3webapps/ROOT/sso/prov/provtest.html. The value inside the file should be the same as the SessionId to be used in the SSO request.
  3. The email value can be changed to any other valid email value.
  4. The account list is a comma-delimited value. This can be changed to all the accounts that the to-be-tested user has access to.
