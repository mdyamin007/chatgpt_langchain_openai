#### What is Product?

|

#### Product Overview

This provides the ability for clients to upload selective inserts to a
member's account for eStatements. This will be independent from selective
print inserts.

  
  
  
#### Where does Product fit?

|

#### Client's Fit

This will allow clients more flexibility with their inserts, especially for
members who are eStatement only and do not see the selective print inserts
mailed out.

#### InfoIMAGE's Fit

This allows our eStatement side to be as competitive as our print side with
the option for eSelective inserts.
