body: ### _Backend:_

Processing steps.

  * Afp
  * Permission
  * Enotice
  * Etax
  * Ecl
  * Paperless

#### Notes on processes:

#### Afp:

  * Previously DefaultEStmtRegistrar was used for Afp. But, Now HypercubeEStmtRegistrar has been used. 

 **N.B: For stmtType= "regE"  can not be processed by afp. There is no entry
in ESTMT_DOC table for "regE" neither dev nor pilot database. **

#### Enotice:

  * Enotice is processed by Doc process.

#### Ecl:

  * Previously emails were inserted to CONTACT_INFO table. but now, emails are inserted in NOTIFICATION_PREFERENCE table. To enable this, two flags have been added in conf file. They are:
    * global.email.storage=notifyPref
    * global.emailUserAcctRef=byUFA  

 ** _Backend Report:_**

  *  **Customized Enrollment Report:** For customized enrollment report, in conf file, the value of "enrollment.queryName" flag has been changed to "SELECT_ENROLL_STATUS_ACCT_BASED". Previously, this value was "SELECT_ENROLL_STATUS_ACCT_BASED_CI" which was used to fetch record using contact_info table. As we are now using notification_preference instead of contact_info, this flag value has been changed.
  *  **Reg E Paperless Report:** Fetches records of a single day whose stmt_type in paperless2 table is "regE". We couldn't find any process by which stmtType="regE" is inserted in paperless2 table.

####  _Data Migration:_

 **NP Migration:**   NOTIFICATION_PREFERENCE table will be used. If
contact_info has a null value, NP is inserting null in the email column.

####  _Hypercube:_

  * Enrollment steps have been redesigned with three steps. 
    * Step 1: eStatement PDF Verification. Clicking "I CANNOT see it", the page is redirected to another page from where the user can either return to the previous page or go to the [www.adobe.com](http://www.adobe.com) to download the adobe reader to be able to view e-Statements. Previously This option was not given. Users were directly redirected to the Adobe download page.
    * Step 2: eStatement Disclosure and Agreement. Clicking "I agree", step 3 is visible. Otherwise, clicking "I do not agree", the user is logged out from the site.
    * Step 3: Account Preferences. The user is forcefully enrolled with delivery preference as paperless. 
  * For both q2SSO and SSO, the same color scheme is maintained.
  * Business Statements are shown in a different tab. Previously i.e. In WFCU ROOT, Business Statements were under Default statements. 
  * If a user changes his delivery preference from paperless to paper, he/she is unenrolled from the site.
  *  **If login with created with a leading zero account, a new account will be created trimming the zeros. (We also tried with pilot data having leading zeroes but couldn't login )**
