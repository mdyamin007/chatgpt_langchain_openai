title: Selective Archival Period
body: # SelectiveArchivalPeriod

This selective Archival period configuration will be used by both front end
and API.  
  

## API

While search document/statements with a archival period(date range) API will
filter based on this configuration so that API does return only the statements
that has a closing date on the range of Archival Period of that specific
statement type.  
Currently API does the filtering based on the configuration in Mongo DB. The
name of the collection in Mongo  
for dev environment is :  **DV_clientProperties**  
for pilot:  **PT_ClientProperties**  
for stage :  **ST_ ClientProperties**

Need to pass vendorId parameter in the request for searchAll api to search for
documents.  
vendorId for infotrac : 900  
vendorId for hypercube : 901  
searchCriteria format :
[{"key":+"startDate",+"operator":+"=","operand":+"2009-05-01"+},{"key":+"endDate","operator":+"=","operand":+"2010-06-01"+}]  
  

## Front End (Hypercube and Infotrac )

From front end the code is done such a way so that old clients configuration
don't get effected.  
we are still using following config:  **statementArchivalPeriod**  for old
clients.  
For new Clients or clients with selective paperless feature we can use the
updated selective archival period configuration.

Sample Json Property for a client that have same selective archival for both
Infotrac and Hypercube (Property on inside parent property)

{  
    "_id": "demo",  
    "cid": "demo",  
    "archivalPeriodPriority": [  
        "appType"  
    ],  
    "archivalPeriod": {  
        "default": 5,  
        "visa": 6,  
        "mortgage": 13,  
        "enotice": 5,  
        "etax": 17,  
        "closedAccount": 6,  
        "unenrolledArchival": 8  
    }  
}
