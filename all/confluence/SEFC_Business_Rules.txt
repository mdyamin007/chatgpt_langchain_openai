# CIF (Member Number) To Accounts Mapping

* * *

SEFC has a unique way to validate account access for users. It is very similar
to an Auth file; however, the data is stored in the EXT_ID_MAPPING instead.

The ID Mapping process record the mapping from an external value, the Member
Number that will be used as the CIF, to all the account numbers that the CIF
can potentiall access. In a way, these records are almost like UFAs. The
difference here is that the user does not actually have the UFAs created. The
records in the EXT_ID_MAPPING is more of a rubric, determining that CIF 12345
_can ** **_ acccess Account 1, 2 and 3. What accounts the user will see when
they log in is determined during SSO. The account list provided by the OLB
will be taken in and checked against what's in the database. The user will
only see the accounts that are passed in during SSO that match with what's in
the database.

For example:

CIF 12345 -> Account 1, Account 2, Account 3

SSO  (CIF 12345) -> Account 1, Account 2, Account 4 -> User will see Account 1
and Account 2.  
Account 3 will not show because it was not passed in in the SSO.  
Account 4 will not show because the database does not have a record for
Account 4 for CIF 12345, i.e. the mapping was not provided in the mapping
index file that was processed in the PUI.

The file that is processed on the PUI is: "PS_ALL..."
