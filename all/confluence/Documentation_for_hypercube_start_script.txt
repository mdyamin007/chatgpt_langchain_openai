Recently **Let 's Encrypt Root Certificate** expired on September 30th and
this change is causing some issues.

Older versions of Meteor, more specifically anything older than Meteor v1.9
shipped with a Node.JS version below v10,

If you are getting errors like Connection error (certificate has expired) when
running Meteor commands it means that you are running a version of Meteor
older than v1.9.

A workaround, for now, is to run all the meteor commands with the following
environment variable  ** _NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED_** , for example in the
deploy command:

  

For hypercube,

powershellHypercube run command

  

For Windows:

  

  

  

Also note that if you are running old distributions, like Ubuntu 16 and
before, locally, or in any of your CI pipelines you may also face this issue.
In this case, we do recommend updating your distribution, or your local
repository of root certificates (the how-to of this varies based on your
distribution).

This is not a Meteor or Galaxy issue, but it's a change in the Let's Encrypt
certificate in our resources that you are accessing.
