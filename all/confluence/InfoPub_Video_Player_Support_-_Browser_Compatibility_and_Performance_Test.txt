title: InfoPub Video Player Support - Browser Compatibility and Performance Test
body: To show offers via video, a media player has been integrated in the offer
catalog page. Cross platform browser compatibility and performance testing has
been performed to ensure the proper functionality of the player through
various browsers.

  

## Objectives

1.Select several media players to be integrated.  
2\. Check performance of the media players through several browsers in
multiple operating systems.  
3\. Choose the best one based on performance and UI.

  

## Determining the desired media player

First of all, we searched for popular media players which have been already
used in different web applications. We came up with three variants naming
"Afterglow", "Videojs" and the browser provided default media player because
of their professional looking UI and higher acceptance.

  

## Browser Compatibility and environment testing

These are the test results-

  
  

  

## Result

We considered all the results based on cross platform browser compatibility.
During the test, afterglow and videojs came head to head and both of them met
our requirements. Since we had to choose one, we picked afterglow.

1\. Afterglow has native navigation hotkeys assigned in it. Such as m for
mute, space for pause etc.  
2\. Afterglow also has a conventional yet professional looking user interface.
It is also the most widely used media player among the three.
