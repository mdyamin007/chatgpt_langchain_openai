## Goals

  * Reduce processing load from the scanner application.
  * High scalability.
  * Fault-tolerant.

## Background and strategic fit

The scanner is a vital application that ensures InfoIMAGE receives and
processes data files from the client within the agreed upon SLA. Recently, it
was discovered that ISD file recognition logic can sometimes stall the scanner
due the need to decrypt very large files.

## Assumptions

  * The application will accept file recognition jobs through API endpoints.
  * The scanner will be the user primarily sending file recognition requests, but requests can also be made manually.
  * The API endpoints will only be accessible internally (by InfoIMAGE only). 
  * The application will sit inside a docker on, preferably, a unix server.
