#### Where does Expedited Direct Mail Service fit?

|

#### Client's Fit

Direct mail is still a viable marketing strategy. Direct mail is an effective
and affordable way to drive brand awareness, generate leads, and engage with
new customers. It's an excellent opportunity for both new and established
businesses to reach consumers with targeted messages.

#### InfoIMAGE's Fit

Adding Direct Mail will help:

  * InfoIMAGE to start off with a basic foundation to rebuild relationships with clients
  * Build our clients' confidence due to absence of any variable data or complexity
  * Add more high-value work with variable data and high-profit margins (Eg. pre-approval campaigns, welcome kits)
  * Fill mid-month production downtime
  * Provide quick turnaround times
