title: PayebillService
body: When the final submit of payments happens from a jsp page they invoke a method
in interface payebillService. At this point it knows which implementation of
payebillService to use. There are two  
 **EpxPayBillServiceImpl**  and  **AuthorizePayebillServiceImpl**. So far all
payebill clients use Authorize as their payment vendor. Which vendor to use is
defined in PaymentVendor.java.
