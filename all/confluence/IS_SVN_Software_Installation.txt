## Step-by-step guide

 **Ask IS or ISD Manager to create user account on[ca-utils-
pr-01.inofoimageinc.com](http://ca-utils-pr-01.inofoimageinc.com) svn server**

  1. The root user will run the ~/scripts/create_ubuntu_users/create_new_ubuntu_user.sh shell script to create the user under the svn group.
  2. The Manager will need to give you your username and password to login.

  

  

 **Generate ssh rsa public key via Microsoft Windows** (If you prefer to use
putty method, please look up the putty instruction via the tortoiseSVN website
for installation instructions and skip all the steps listed below for setting
up SSH via Windows.)

  1. Open you cmd window and you should be in your C:\Users\YOUR_NAME folder. 
  2. Let's check if you previously installed you own windows ssh public keys.  Type the following command:
    1.         dir .ssh\id_rsa.pub

    2. If the id_rsa.pub file exists, please share the contents to the Manager to insert into your ca-utils-pr-01:~/.ssh/authorized_keys  file or you can do this yourself. 
    3. If the id_rsa.pub file does not exist in you windows folder, then lets create your id_rsa.pub key by typing in the following:
      1.             ssh-keygen -t rsa -N "" 

      2. Once the id_rsa,pub key is created, please share the contents to the Manager to insert into your ca-utils-pr-01:~/.ssh/authorized_keys  file or you can do this yourself.

  

 **Install & Configure TortoiseSVN Client**

  1. Go to TortoiseSVN main website to download the latest client: [Downloads * TortoiseSVN](https://tortoisesvn.net/downloads.html)
  2. Install the client into your computer.
  3. If you prefer to use Putty agent as the SSH client, then please go to the TortoiseSVN main website for instruction.  The following configuration instructions are for Windows SSH client.
  4. Click on the Start Button and look for the TortoiseSVN folder.  Click on the Settings application:
    1.   5. Once the setting menu loads up, select Network and type in the windows SSH client executable location:
    1.
