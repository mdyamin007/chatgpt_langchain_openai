title: Parallel Process
body: Once projects are approved by the client on pilot and code has been moved over
and tested on stage, we go through this internal process among other necessary
departments to test everything together on stage before releasing code to
production. On Team Support, a Master Parallel ticket will be created and
child-tickets for Print and Electronic will also be created and assigned to
the respective developers.

## Step-by-step guide

Upon opening the Electronic ticket, you should see a table in comment 1 like
so:

  

For ISD, the parallel process is usually comprised of three steps:

  1. Prep - 
    1. Fill in the table with respect to any updates made (i.e. If there is a new resource file uploaded, add the resource filename in the Values section next to the Resource files section).
      1. Note: Edit permissions are required to update the table. If it does not appear, let David know.
    2. Pass the ticket along and change the following information:

Status: ISD_Prep -> ISD_PREP_DONE  
Assignee: Set to AC/IM individual  
Group: Set to AC/Implementation (Note: Each AC has their own group, for
example Daphne_AC, Joye_AC, etc).

  

  2. Verification - This occurs when DP posts the files onto stage and needs us to verify. 
    1. Verify necessary updates on stage.

    2. Pass the ticket along and change the following:

Status: ISD_Verifying -> Set to either:

      * ISD_Pass: If everything looks good. 
      * ISD_Fail: If something is incorrect or missing (i.e. Index file has missing account numbers)

Assignee: Set to AC/IM individual  
Group: Set to AC/Implementation

  

  3. Production release  

    1. Proceed with releasing to production
    2. Pass the ticket along and change the following:

Status: Ready_for_Release -> Released

Assignee: Set to AC/IM individual  
Group: Set to AC/Implementation

  

Notes:

  * The JEF/Jira ticket number is usually found only on the Master Parallel ticket, not on the Electronic ticket.
  * As ISD, we should never have to deal with the Master Parallel, only the Electronic parallel ticket. If a Master Parallel is assigned to you, assign it back to the AC/IM.
