title: Mule-ESB Evaluation- Mule ESB Community Edition (CE) Vs Enterprise Edition (EE)
body: Given below three options identified & discussed for the Mule ESB deployment &
implementation:

  1.  **Option-1:**  Mule Community Edition (CE)
    1. The ESB itself would be free open source product
    2. Any additional modules like JDBC and ACLs need to be implemented using Spring-Security, Data, LDAP Modules. That means additional development time needed to implement those plug-ins.
  2.  **Option-2:**  Mule CE plus purchase key modules
    1. We can avoid paying large amount of subscription cost if individual purchase of functional module makes sense.
    2. Key modules needed:
      * JDBC Connector
      * Role based access controls (R-ACLs)
    3. Need to determine if the module purchase costs make sense.  **TODO: Need to check with MuleSoft**
  3.  **Option-3:**  Mule EE with Silver maintenance/support subscription
    1. Mule EE (4-Cores server) will cover all modules like JDBC, R-ACLs and SAML etc.
    2. Additional development work will still be required but significantly less.
    3. Silver subscription support with be helpful especially when limited documentation & forum support available.

>  **Reference:**  
>  Refer attached document:

>  **Summary:**  
>  It would be the best to go after the Option-3 (Silver subscription) if it
> make sense for the budget. It would say much development time and help
> having a smooth setup and deployment exercise with the support package at
> hand. If we would like to just go with minimum cost approach during the POC
> time-frame, Option-2 would be good alternative as well. However, that would
> depend on how much MuleSoft charge for the functional modules.
