title: acctId/acctNum which one should be used as destination account for epay?
body: Ok. That's the transaction report still. So, you are correct that it needs to
be accountNum + accountType + stmtType to uniquely identify a particular epay
account.  
Either that, or the ExternalAccountNumber that we capture from client. (Alok,
please confirm we are getting this stored per prior discussion).

That being said, the ACCT_ID in data-model do NOT change. It should continue
to stay. And it has no direct effect on none of following:  
1\. how we add meta info to EPX transaction  
2\. how these meta info show up in transaction reports (from EPX to InfoIMAGE)  
3\. how these meta info show up in transaction reports (from InfoIMAGE to
client) for balancing

To avoid future confusion among both sides, All of the above need to be
captured in wiki as business requirements.

Thanks.

Subject: Re: acctId/acctNum? which one should be used as destination account
for epay.

Hello Ben,

We were talking about the data that merchant will get from EPX, that this
account has a payment with X amount.

As Amjad mentioned one more thing,

Statement type (account type) is required with account number to make a unique
account information for merchant. As we know multiple account have same
account number under same CID but there will be different account type like:
NA, DD, SV, LN etc.

If we use acctNum as destination account for epay then should not we need to
pass statementType along with acctNum to EPX?

Thanks

    I'm confused......
    
    
    I believe this email thread is about the Transaction Report file being passed between InfoIMAGE and client, right?  
        If so, then I agree with Alok that AccountID definitely should NOT be used because client would have no idea what the value of AccountID represents.
    
    
    The feedback I provided to use ACCT_ID are all for the data-modeling in our databases.  It doesn't have any direct impact on what you need to produced on the report.
    
    
    Help me understand if I'm not following.
    
    
    Thanks.

    Hi Alok,
    
    
    We got the email. The payment db design has been changed several time.  
        ACCT_ID is suggested to use by Ben. Please take a look on the attach email.
    
    
    Thanks
    
    
    --amjad

accountid is definitely not to forwarded to epx i.e obvious & logical.

Yes we will pass the accoutnum & statement type(correct naming & not
accounttype).

I was looking for you to find out what are we doing in the code currently.
Accountid for sure should not be used. But there must be some logic about
account id, If storage is per accountid based then front end needs to pull the
account number against account id before sending to the APIs. I thnk the APIs
to fetch account number has not been used correctly. But I will wait for you
guys to give the findings.

Thanks  
Alok

Subject: acctId/acctNum? which one should be used as destination account for
epay.

Hi Ben & Alok,

    
    
    From our discussion we found the following items. Please correct if we  
    do wrong.

First item.

1\. acctNum is not unique to merchant.

2\. acctType is required with acctNum to make it unique to merchant.

If we use acctNum as destination account for epay then we have to pass  
acctType along with acctNum to EPX.

Second item.

3\. acctId is unique but it is only for infoImage. We are not sure is the  
Merchant aware about acctId?

If we use acctId as destination account for epay then we are not sure  
how merchant will do mapping the payment with destination account.

Please advise which one is the right option for us.

Thanks

-amjad
