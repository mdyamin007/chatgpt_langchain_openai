title: Analysis for Supporting WCAG 2.1(A) in Hypercube
body: This document is about what's new in WCAG 2.1(A) and what is needed to update
hypercube for making it ADA compliant according to WCAG 2.1(A) standard.

In WCAG 2.1 there are 17 changes from WCAG 2.0.

  

 **WCAG 2.1 Standard**

 **Description**

 **Updates needed in hypercube**  
  
---|---|---  
  
2.1.4 Character Key Shortcuts (A)

|

If a keyboard shortcut is implemented in content using only letter (including
upper- and lower-case letters), punctuation, number, or symbol characters,
then at least one of the following is true:

 **Turn off:**

A mechanism is available to turn the shortcut off;

 **Remap:**

A mechanism is available to remap the shortcut to use one or more non-
printable keyboard characters (e.g. Ctrl, Alt, etc).

 **Active only on focus:**

The keyboard shortcut for a user interface component is only active when that
component has focus.

|

No such shortcut key functionality is available in hypercube.  
  
2.5.1 Pointer Gestures (A)

|

All functionality that uses multipoint or path-based gestures for operation
can be operated with a single pointer without a path-based gesture unless a
multipoint or path-based gesture is essential.

|

For zooming functionality, there should be buttons for zooming in or out.  
  
2.5.2 Pointer Cancellation (A)

|

For functionality that can be operated using a single pointer, at least one of
the following is true:

 **No Down-Event:**

The down-event of the pointer is not used to execute any part of the function;

 **Abort or Undo:**

Completion of the function is on the up-event, and a mechanism is available to
abort the function before completion or to undo the function after completion;

 **Up Reversal:**

The up-event reverses any outcome of the preceding down-event;

 **Essential:**

Completing the function on the down-event is essential.

|

It should be ensured that if users accidentally touch any button and then just
slide their finger off that button then it will abort the functionality caused
by touching that button.  
  
2.5.3 Label in Name (A)

|

For user interface components with labels that include text or images of text,
the name contains the text that is presented visually.

|

All the visual label and programmatic name of any component should be the
same.  
  
2.5.4 Motion Actuation (A)

|

Functionality that can be operated by device motion or user motion can also be
operated by user interface components and responding to the motion can be
disabled to prevent accidental actuation.

|

No motion functionality is available in hypercube.
