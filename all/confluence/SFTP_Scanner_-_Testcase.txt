title: SFTP Scanner - Testcase
body: NOTE:

  * Make sure email-id configured under the client-info is set to the internal email-id. The email should not be sent to the customer.

  
  

## 1\. Functional Test Cases for Use Case: Move file

This section provides an overview of functional test cases for  **moving
files**  from  _ftproot_  to  _ftpbu_.

Clients should have a File-Transfer-Status setup in PUI which contains the
email-ids and file schedules for  _incoming-files_.  
The  _config.properties_  file can define multiple  **ftproot**  machines
using  _global.scanner.0.ftpRootPath_  variable.  
  

### 1.1 Test Case: Move File

#.| CID| Condition being tested| Expected Result| Actual Result| DEV Testing  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
T1| Any client| Configure multiple ftproot machines in the
_config.properties_  file. Define a schedule for a CID in DPJS->File-Transfer-
Status screen in PUI.| File should be moved to the respective folder BU. Data
should be recorded in the log file|  
| Passed. File transferred/moved to target location from single source sftp
server.  
T2| Any client| Use a CID with no file schedule defined in DPJS->File-
Transfer-Status screen in PUI.| Same as above|  
| Passed. Test performed using EaiAdmin CID.  
T3| Any client| Define a schedule for multiple CID in DPJS->File-Transfer-
Status screen in PUI. Use a file with size greater than 4GB. Run the scanner
multiple times.| Same as above|  
| Passed. Test performed against ~4GB file with CID=EaiAdmin  
  
  
  

## 2\. Functional Test Cases for Use Case: Send Email

This section provides an overview of functional test cases for  **sending
confirmation and alert emails**  to clients.  
CID's used for test cases in this section should have a schedule for a CID in
DPJS->File-Transfer-Status screen in PUI.

For alert emails, the alert interval and frequency should be specified in
_CID.fts.alertCount_  and  _CID.fts.alertInterval_.  
The confirmation email could be configured to send out multiple emails; one
for each file received.  
 _CID.confirmation.multipleEmail_  in config.properties sets this feature.  
  

### 2.1 Test Case: Move File

#.| CID| Condition being tested| Expected Result| Actual Result| DEV Testing  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
T5| Any client| Configure a filename with a regular expression. Place an input
file that satisfies this condition.| A confirmation email should be sent.|  
| Passed.  
T6| Any client| For the above test case, place an input file that does not
match the regular expression.| A confirmation email should be sent but the
contents should indicate that the file was not recognized|  
| Passed.  
T7| Any client| Select the case sensitive box and place an input file
accordingly.| A confirmation email should be sent. If the file doesn't match
the case, the contents should indicate that the file was not recognized|  
| Passed.  
T8| Any client| Select the various options in the "Due Method"| Confirmation
email is expected|  
| Passed.  
T9| Any client| Run the scanner multiple times without an input file.
Configure the alert count and alert Interval variables| If the file is
overdue, an alert email should be sent. The frequency and interval is
determined by the variables in the config file|  
| Passed.  
T10| Any client| Run the scanner for an input file| The email should contain
the checksum value; MD5/CRC is determined by the client setting|  
| Passed.  
T11| SNFB| Set  _snfb.confirmation.multipleEmail=true_. Run the scanner with 2
input files| 2 confirmation emails must be sent.The subject of each email
contains the filename that was uploaded. The contents should contain all both
the filenames|  
| Passed.  
  
  
  

## 3\. Functional Test Cases for Use Case: Trigger a PUI process

This section provides an overview of functional test cases for  **triggering
PUI processes**  for specific clients.

The input file must be  **decrypted**  and copied to Input server for use by
the PUI process.  
  

### 3.1 Test Case: Trigger a PUI Process

#.| CID| Condition being tested| Expected Result| Actual Result| Dev Testing  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
T15| MWCU| Place an input file for MWCU and run the scanner. The input file
must be pgp encrypted.| The file should be moved to the corresponding BU
folder. A copy should be decrypted placed in the Input Server  _( .\process-
files\CID)_. The process must be triggered in PUI.|  
| Not applicable for Phase-I  
T16| WTCU| Place an input file for WTCU and run the scanner. The input file
must be zipped| The file should be moved to the corresponding BU folder. A
copy should be unzipped placed in the Input Server  _( .\process-files\CID)_.
The process must be triggered in PUI|  
| Not applicable for Phase-I  
  
  
  

## 4\. Reconcile Process Flow Testing

This section provides an overview of functional test cases for  **reconcile**
process flow for various file schedule.

The file-schedule must have various scheduled like daily (one time & multiple
time), weekly, monthly schedule configured.  
Identify & select CID having covering various types of file schedule .  
  

### 4.1 Test Case: Reconcile Process

#.| CID| Condition being tested| Expected Result| Actual Result| Dev Testing  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
T20| test| Select a file-name having schedule defined as daily.| The Reconcile
flow must pick up & process the schedule. It should also send an email for the
missing (not-received) files with given number of alerts & time-intervals.|  
| Passed.  
T21| cacu| Select a file-name having schedule defined as weekly.| The
Reconcile flow must pick up & process the schedule. It should also send an
email for the missing (not-received) files with given number of alerts & time-
intervals.|  
| Passed.  
T22| test| Place a file where file-name is not defined under the file-schedule
table.| The scanner service flow must pick up & process the file with
unidentified file name. It should also send an email for the unknown(not-
defined) file type.
