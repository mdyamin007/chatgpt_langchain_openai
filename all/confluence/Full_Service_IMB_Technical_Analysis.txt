title: Full Service IMB Technical Analysis
body: Per Ernest on 8/16/2013:

We have to modify the following for this project:

  * Isisdisk.sh
  * Isisdisk_daily.sh
  * New common dfa module to output IMB with 6 or 9digit MID
  * Create counters in DB
  * For Texas, 50 print dfa
  * For Menlo, 73 print dfa (84 - 11 also used for texas jobs)

We should keep the current logic for the 6digit MID handling which is ASE2. We
will add the new code of ASE3 to handle the 9digit MID so that in the future,
if we decide to get our own sorting equipment in Texas and use our own MID, we
do not have to make too much changes. Also we do not have to spend time
immediately on modifying the 73 print dfa for Menlo. We will set up an
external module that can handle both the 6 digit and 9 digit MID to be used in
the dfa to minimize the work and maintain the quality.

It will take about 2 weeks to set up the 1st 4 items listed above. Each dfa
will take about 2 hours to set up and test. So for Texas alone, it will take
100 hours just for the dfa changes.
