### Database

 **USR_SESSION** : Account number as _sess_login_id._ DSO is null.  
 **USR_MAPPING** : No data.  
 **NOTIFICATION_PREFERENCE** : No data. Uses CONTACT_INFO table.

### Login Method

SSO7

### SSO (SSO7)

  * Users will hit on two different uri's (/WESCOMSSO and /MALSSO), both point to same servlet(SingleSignOn7Servlet) with same parameters. 
  * Only account number is needed for successful SSO, email is not mandatory.
  * Does not update email.
  * Account number will be zero-padded at the front if length is less than 10 digits. 
  * Will create login if user is new.  

### DSO

N/A

### Leading Zero Account

  * No leading zero trimming while SSO. 
  * If account number is less than 10 digits long, it will be zero-padded at the front to make it 10 digits long. 
  * Database stores the account number with leading zero, but in the ROOT site, account numbers are shown by trimming leading zeros.

### Welcome Email

N/A

### Enrollment

N/A

### Statement Types & Archival Period

Eight types of statements are:

  * ESTMT_DOC: default, escrow, visa_gold, visa_plat, visa_duet, visa_mbs ==> 24
  * ENOTICE: enotice ==> 24
  * ETAX: etax ==> 36

### Delivery Preference

  * Paper = B, Paperless = E, New = N
  * Can't change delivery preference from ROOT/MSM site. 
  * Delivery preference can only be changed by Paperless process. 

### Notification Preference

  * Only Email is supported. No SMS support. 
  * Uses CONTACT_INFO table. No data in NOTIFICATION_PREFERENCE table.

### Paperless Configuration

Non-Selective. Can't assign different emails to different statement types.

### NP Link Type

byUSR. Uses CONTACT_INFO table.

### Menu Tabs

### Concerns

  1. Account numbers have to be 10 characters long. If it is less then 10 characters, then it will be zero-padded at the front. If moved to Hypercube, have to provide account numbers with leading zero to perform sso. 
  2. Also, the ROOT site shows the account number by trimming the leading zero(s). Can Hypercube do that? 
  3. Only database stores the account number with leading zero. ROOT and MSM site shows account number without leading zeroes.

##  **MSM**  

### Statement Search

  * Can search for an account's statements by account number only. 
  * Can search with or without leading zero(s).
  * Has statement transfer.

##  **PUI**

###  _ **Backend Processes**_

SLCU has 7 backend process:

  * Afp
  * Permission
  * Insert
  * Enotice
  * Paperless 
  * Etax
  * Doc

#### Settings

  * global.multipleStmtType=true
  * global.multipleDocType=false
  * global.enableAccountType=false
  * global.autoRegister=true
  * global.ssoKey=sl1!c2@u

####  _ **Statement types and index file name**_

  * global.ms1=default
  * global.mv1=visa_gold
  * global.mv2=visa_plat
  * global.mv3=visa_mbs
  * global.mv4=visa_duet
  * global.ms4=default
  * global.dla=enotice
  * global.dna=enotice
  * global.es1=escrow

  

###  _ **Afp Process**_

Statements that will be processed by Afp:

Flags:

  * afp.compression=true

#### Handler (data):  _ _AfpStatementData6__  

 _ **fileName**  |  **acctNum**  |  **beginDate**  |  **closingDate**  |
**numOfPages**  |  **acctName**  | ssn | appType | messageIds_

  *  **Bold**  indicates mandatory field.
  * Set sequence number from  **fileName**. Split File_Name with "_", if length == 5 take arr[3] as seqNum else take substring from arr[3] from 0 to starting of ".afp" or ".pdf". 

#### Registrar:  _ _MessageEStmtRegistrar__

  * Always creates a new account if not found. 
  * As global.autoRegister is true, creates a new  ** _USR_**  and  ** _USR_SESSION_**  record. 
  * Set DSO date in  ** _USR_SESSION_**  table. 
  * Set account number as  _sess_login_id_  in  ** _USR_SESSION_**  table. 
  * Does not create user mapping. 
  * If a record is found in the  ** _FIN_ACCOUNT_**  table, update  _acct_owner_name,_  unless the name is "MEMBER". 
  * As multipleDocType is false, data will be blindly inserted while registering statements. 
  * Image_Message is true for " **default** ", " **visa** " and " **loan** ". Therefore registerMessage method will be called for those statement types. 
  * As multipleDocType is false, email notification will be turned on. So  ** _EmailNotification.register_**  method will be called.

  

 **getFinAccount()**

  * Search account with the  **account number** : 
    * If not found: 
      * Inserts into  _ **FIN_ACCOUNT**_  with the account number, name and set the status to NA,  **no acct_type**. 
      * Create  _ **USR**_ _ _ and  _ **USR_SESSION**_  with  **account number as sess_login_id, DSO date.**  
      * Insert into  _ **USR_FIN_ACCOUNT**_  with  **acct_id**  &  **usr_id**. 
    * If found: 
      * Updates the user's  **first_name**  to account name. 
  * Insert into paperless ( _ **PAPERLESS**_ )
  *  _FIN_ACCOUNT_ **:   type -> NA, Status -> A**.
  *  _USR_FIN_ACCOUNT:  _ **ufa_status  -> active.**
  *  _PAPERLESS **:**_    **p_new_status  -> B, p_old_status -> N. **
  *  _PAPERLESS2:  _ **p_latest_status  -> B, p_old_status -> N.**

#### Mismatch with Hypercube Business:

  *  ** _sess_login_id_**   **= acctNum**  instead of  ** _!usr_id_**
  * Though  **autoRegister**  is set to true, no entry in  ** _USR_MAPPING  _**table. 
  *  **DSO**   **date**  not null.

#### Changes Needed:

  *  **Registrar  -> **
    * Use  **HypercubeEStmtRegistrar**  as the registrar for Afp process instead of  **MessageEStmtRegistrar**. 
    * In  **HypercubeEStmtRegistrar.registerMessages()**  method, add a check to  **cast data1 to AfpStatmentData6.**  

  

###  _ **Paperless Process**_

Statements that will be processed by Paperless:

Flags:

  * paperless.classPath=com.infoimage.processing.application.paperless.handler.SlcuPaperlessHandler

#### Handler (data):  _ _SlcuPaperlessHandler__  

 _ **acctNum**  |  **status**  | email_

  *  **Bold**  indicates mandatory field.
  * Only digits are allowed as account number.

#### Registrar:  _ _EnrollmentRegistrar__

  * Sets DSO date in USR_SESSION table.
  * Sets account number as sess_login_id. 
  * Puts no record in USR_MAPPING table. 

 **enroll():**

  * Search for account by account number.
  * If account not found ->
    * Creates new account and user if account is not found ->  _FIN_ACCOUNT, USR, USR_SESSION._  
    * Creates user and account mapping ->  _USR_FIN_ACCOUNT._   
  * If account is found -> 
    * Search for user and account mapping by account number. 
    * If mapping not found -> 
      * Creates new user profile ->  _USR, USR_SESSION_
    * If mapping found ->
      * Get the user data by user id. 
  * Get the admin user profile by login id as "superuser". 
  * Search and insert/updates the email address by ci id.
  * If contact_info record not found -> 
    * Creates new contact_info record ->  _CONTACT_INFO_. 
  * If contact_info record found -> 
    * Get the old email address by ci id.
    * If (old email not found and new email is provided from index file) or (old email and new email does not match) -> 
      * Sets the email from index file as ci_email_addr ->  _CONTACT_INFO._
      * Creates a new audit log record ->  _AUDIT_LOG_SLCU_.  
  * Search for paperless record by account id and statement type as "default".
    * If paperless record not found -> 
      * Insert new papaerless record ->  _PAPERLESS  _(p_old_status -> "N", p_new_status -> "B"). 
      * If "E" was sent from index file ->  _PAPERLESS  _(p_old_status -> "B", p_new_status -> "E"). 
    *  If new status was "B" and index file sends "E" (opt-out) -> 
      * Update paperless reocrd ->  _PAPERLESS  _(p_old_status -> "B", p_new_status -> "E"). 
    * If new status was "E" and index file sends "B" (opt-in) -> 
      * Update paperless reocrd ->  _PAPERLESS  _(p_old_status -> "E", p_new_status -> "B"). 
  *  _FIN_ACCOUNT:   _acct_owner_name -> "New Member", last_modified_date -> today's date.
  *  _USR_SESSION:_  sess_login_id -> acccount number, dso -> today's date.
  *  _USR_FIN_ACCOUNT:  _ufa_status -> "pre_reg", ufa_registrationdate -> today's date.
  *  _USR:_  usr_firstName -> "New Member".
  *  _CONTACT_INFO:  _ci_email_addr -> email from index file or null.
  *  _AUDIT_LOG_SLCU:_  created_by -> admin id(1), target_user -> user id, old_value -> old email, new_value -> email from index file. 
  *  _PAPERLESS:  _p_old_status -> "N/B/E", p_new_status -> "B/E".

  

  * Email is only updated through a paperless process. 
  * In process file email is not mandatory. So if null email is processed then, the existing email in the CONTACT_INFO table will be replaced by null value. 
  *  ** _sess_login_id_**   **= acctNum**  instead of  ** _!usr_id_**
  * No entry in  ** _USR_MAPPING  _**table.
  *  **DSO date**  not null.

###  _ **Doc Process**_

  * No process file is found that will be processed by DOC.  
  *  ** _sess_login_id_**   **= acctNum**  instead of  ** _!usr_id_**
  *  **DSO**   **date**  not null.

###  _ **Enotice Process**_

  * Will be done by Doc process. (Enotice process files has doc process data file format)
  * enotice.createAccount=false, no account will be created if not found.

###  _ **Etax Process**_

  * No change needed. 
  * etax.createAccount=false, no account will be created if not found.

### Permission Process

Handler: DefaultPermHandler

  1.  **acctNum** | acctType

Registrar: DefaultPermRegistrar

  1. As permission.purge is true, it deletes all records from the ACCT_ACCESS table for SLCU. 
  2. After purging, the index file will be processed.
  3. For each account number in the index file, insert into ACCT_ACCESS table with aa_min_level as 3.

---|---|---|---|---  
SSO| User Enrollment Logic|

SLCU does not have any enrollment process.

|  53 complete **Supported** 54 incomplete Not Supported |  
  
Misc|

  * During SSO, new account, user, ufa, session and paperless records are created. Sets sso date. 
  * Account numbers have to be 10 characters long. If it is less then 10 characters, then it will be zero-padded at the front. Database stores them with leading zero(s).
  * Email is not mandatory during sso and is not being updated. 

|  51 complete **Needs Feedback** |

If we move SLCU to Hypercube, account numbers with leading zero must be
provided during SSO for so that database will store the account number with
leading zero.

  
  
  
Menu  
  
| Tabs (Statements)|

  * Shows full account number without leading zero(s). Though database stores the number with leading zero.
  * eStatement, Escrow and eNotices have inserts. 
  * No important(side) disclosures. 
  * If no statement is present, shows a custom message 

  

|  19 complete **Needs Feedback** |

Currently hypercube does not show the trimmed version of an account number.
The zero(s) will be masked with (*).

Custom verbiage for accounts without statement, can be shown in Hypercube by
introducing a new flag. As this verbiage is client specific, so the whole
verbiage will be stored as the value of the new flag in properties.json file.  
  
Tab (Billing Rights)|

  * Shows billing rights for monthly and visa statements. 
  * Two PDF links open in new tab: Account Statement Billing Rights, Visa Account Billing Rights.
