## **What is PDF File format?**

##  **What can we do with PDF file format?**

  * Reposition address block to our standard as long as information is consistent.
  * Reposition logo and resize logo to match our standard(logo artwork needed)
  * Reposition return address to our standard
  * Identify data for special handling (statement suppression, returns, etc.)  
  * *****DO NOT OFFER WITHOUT CONSULTING IS/BA***** we can do small changes if variables are in static position/first page. for example a phone number that may need to be changed or removed. *****DO NOT OFFER WITHOUT CONSULTING IS/BA*****

  

##  **What are some of the RedTitan Software limitations with PDF file
format?**

  * We cannot work with rasterized PDF. PDF must be "searchable". *Note depending on encode method/extract method from client we have seen in the past sometime searchable PDFs do not function. Please load into red titan for quick test(Training Pending)
  * We cannot work with a PDF whose start(after address block) of the statement isn't below 3.3 inches from the top and . Client would have to change with core and resend files.
    * (PLEASE INCLUDE SCREEN ILLUSTRATING THE BULLET POINT ABOVE) 
    * Please note in cases where coupon at the bottom is used to show through window this would be opposite.
    * (PLEASE INCLUDE SCREEN ILLUSTRATING THE BULLET POINT ABOVE) 
  * All of our parsing is done only on Page 1 of each document and data must be in a fixed location consistently for all documents.  Currently RedTitan to our knowledge does not support parsing data on page 2 and onwards.
    * All important information that is required(Account Number, Address, Statement Dates, and at least 1 anchor that is unique to the first page. THIS DATA MUST BE IN _**EXACT SAME POSITION**_.
  * We cannot move data around with the exception of items listed in previous section (i.e. Generally the Address Block).
  * We only support black & white;  No grey scale and no color.
    * Color pre-print can be used for print
  * Images included in the PDF may not keep same quality

##  **What are some are some of the customer guidelines to supply us with the
PDF file format?**

 _ **PDF File Requirements:**_

  1. Require individual pdfs; index would be optimal
  2. If a single big pdf is the only option, we would require a counts file to reconcile after processing.
    1. If this route is taken. Please be aware there may be file size limitation and a test run would be needed to determine extent and what we could do to fix.
  3. Must have clearance with our margins. **most common would be left side margin intruding on OMR lines**  Please refer to OPS margin guidelines ( put link / attachment here)
  4. Request client to not mask the account number in the PDF file if possible. If not cross reference file may be needed. 

NOTE: InfoIMAGE's ability to mask account numbers is dependent on the account
number positioning and justification.

*If no way to grab account number. Client can add number to top right so we may pull it but we can remove it for print. We cannot post or archive. Print would have no tracking method.
  5. If required, the application code must be identified consistently for electronic posting within page one PDF file.  This app code data must be in a fixed position consistently for all documents.
    1. If not a cross reference file would be needed. This is usually for combined monthly statements and notices that have potential different account types that do not contain specific codes to pull this from the pdf. This would need to uniquely identify via account number/name address/etc... to pull said account type. Please keep in mind this is only for setups where account types are required. Usually mortgage and other loan applications are 1 single account type and thus these indexes are not needed for these applications.
  6. All pages in the PDF needs to be the same Page Size; (e.g.  If it is 8.5 x 11, all pages needs to be 8.5 x 11)
  7. All pages needs to be in portrait orientation; i.e. Not landscape or mix of landscape and portait).

1\. Copy file into /d/share/ directory. ISS/AC-Secure are not available on
these machines.In same location create a file with a .EE extension this file
can be used for all tests in future.

  
2\. Remote into computer that contains the latest Redtitan software.

4\. Click "File" tab and then "open". Click "Computer" and locate the "share"
drive. Search for the location of test pdf and select.

  
5\. Once loaded you will see the pdf

*****Steps below are very important to not mess with production configuration
files. Please note these files do not get "checked in" to maintain version
controls so it may be difficult to retrieve data.  
you never want to point anything to the production directories. D$, download,
ftpbu directories as these contain production data files. The configuration
files needed for redtitan live on the remote computer c drive and usually
default to a .EE file in test"

  
6\. Click "Fields" tab then "Edit". A popup with more tabs will be revealed.

  
7\. Move to "File" tab. The important items here are the "Field Definition
File" and "Default field definition file". Starting with "Default field
definition file" and browse for your .EE file select file the click "Apply".
This will change the "Field Definition File" above.  
click "Load" then "Save". *Before save make sure "Save definitions on close or
exit" is not checked.

  
8\. Close this popup window.  
9\. Using cursor you can drag as if selecting text starting with address
block/account number. You will see a red box form upon selecting text and a
popup. The software is very sensitive so even a slim line passing touching any
part of a letter it will get picked up.

  
10a. From the popup select "New Field". If the text was readable you will see
the text you selected in the blue field box.

10b. If it was not successful you will see something like "FIELD1", blank, or
weird characters and you will not see the text you selected This means we
cannot use this pdf. This is only important for needed information. The body
as shown in screenshot would not matter but just used for example.

  
11\. Close pop up and continue repeating steps 9 and 10 for each piece of
important information that needs to be pulled.  
12\. Once complete you can simply exit out of the software

*****NOTE: At any point during this you may unexpectedly see another instance
of Redtitan begin and start running something. Do not be alarmed and let it
run in the background. This is processing either a production run or a test
run. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO CLOSE THIS BY ACCIDENT IF YOU DO PLEASE CONTACT DP AND
LET THEM KNOW.
