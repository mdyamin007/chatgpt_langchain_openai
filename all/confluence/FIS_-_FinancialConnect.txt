The web service call we need to use for updating statement delivery preference

## 5\. High-level Implementation Steps

  1. The eStatement Application will invoke the FIS Workflow URL with the required input parameters.
  2. The Mule ESB Workflow service will process the request and form the input request for the FIS web-services (WS) call.
  3. The Mule ESB Workflow will invoke the FIS WS call using workflow WS Client (CXF WS - SOAP).
  4. The Mule ESB workflow will parse the response and perform processing like store result into the database (DB) or post to Active-MQ (JMS), if applicable.
  5. The Mules ESB workflow will return the response to the eStatement calling applicaton with the result output.
  6. The Mule ESB can also store the transactional data into the ESB database in order to maintain the transaction log.
