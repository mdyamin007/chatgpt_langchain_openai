You need to do the following before trying to h it the member site of an SSO
client

  1. Following three values should the same eg. !prov@2008

cid.conf>  global.ssoKey=!prov@2008  
  web.xml>       <context-param>  
        <param-name>com.infoimage.security.ssignonpw</param-name>  
        <param-value>!prov@2008</param-value>  
        <description>Single-signon password</description>  
    </context-param>

usr_session.sess_password ( before login in this value will be unencrypted)

  1. In the html page you should modify the action url to reflect the right environment  
return url should match the value of string String OSIHomeBankingURL =
"<http://10.8.8.212:9999/provtest.html?WES=dfsdfsf>"; in root/hblogin.jsp

  2. Make sure you have processed a recent auth file this will link acct_number used in the file with user_id. The acct_number in the file should match acct_number you have used in the application (eg. tax,statement etc)
  3. Single sign on case you are already registered.
  4. Run the following query after you run the auth file  

select fa.acct_number, fa.acct_id, sess_login_id from fin_Account fa,
usr_fin_account ufa, usr_session us  
where fa.acct_id=ufa.acct_id  
and us.usr_id=ufa.usr_id  
and fa.org_id=getorgid('prov');

    
          
    

  5. which ever acct you are trying to test make sure sessionid in prov_sso_test.html,provtest.html and sess_login_id values are matching
  6. Hit the prov_sso_test.html. Click on ok button. If SSO is working correctly you should land on member site accept disclosure page.
