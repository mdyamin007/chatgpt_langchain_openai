# InfoIMAGE Single Sign-On

The Single Sign-On module allows a user from a financial institution to gain a
secure access to InfoIMAGE eStatements services without asking the user to
perform any authentication on screen. The financial institution will handle
the authentication process behind the screen by delivering predefined
authentication data to InfoIMAGE over the secure sockets layer (SSL) protocol.
This allows the user to have quick and seamless access to InfoIMAGE
eStatements services.  
When a user clicks on the eStatements link on the home banking site of the
financial institution, the financial institution will construct the
authentication data and transmit it with the user's email address to InfoIMAGE
over the SSL protocol. InfoIMAGE will validate the authentication data by
using a secret message that is shared between the two parties. If the
authentication succeeds, InfoIMAGE will reply the financial institution with a
session key; otherwise, the financial institution will receive an error
message. Given a session key, the financial institution will embed the session
key to the link to InfoIMAGE eStatements services and send the modified link
to the user's browser, which should automatically redirect the user to the
link. InfoIMAGE will validate the session key and grant the access to the
user. If necessary, session information can be posted back to the financial
institution's servers, allowing its home banking application to keep the
user's session alive while the user is accessing InfoIMAGE eStatements
services. The following diagram illustrates the entire single sign-on process
in the normal situation.

In order to provide additional security on the transmission of the
authentication data, InfoIMAGE will enable IP filtering such that only
requests coming from the financial institution will be processed on
InfoIMAGE's servers.

##  

## Technical Details

There are three steps that need to be taken to connect to the InfoIMAGE
eStatement Site successfully:

  1. Generate Authentication Data: generate a Hash Data Value to be passed to InfoIMAGE during the ssoKeyGen step.
  2. SSO Key Generation: request SSO access from InfoIMAGE by passing the generated Hash Data Value. On a successful attempt, an SSO Key will be returned.
  3. SSO Exchange: log the user into InfoIMAGE eStatements Site using the SSO Key returned by InfoIMAGE.

## Step 1 - Generate Authentication Data

The authentication data is an ASCII string that is sent from the financial
institution to InfoIMAGE. It consists of a Hash Value, a User Identification
Number, and the Current Date concatenated in the listed order. Depending on
the hashing algorithm that is chosen, the length of authentication data is
different.

 **We recommend using SHA-256 as this is the most secure encryption method.**

## Hash Value

The hash value is a hexadecimal string representing the result of a hashing
algorithm. The supported algorithms are MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256.

Specifications:

  * Input is a 36-character-long ASCII string consisting of the Client Code ID, the User Identification Number, the SSO Password, and the Current Date.
  * All characters must be lowercase.
  * Length must be:
    * 32 characters long if using MD5
    * 40 characters long if using SHA-1
    * 64 characters long if using SHA-256

##  

## User Identification Number

This is the ID used by InfoIMAGE to identify a unique user. This value should
be the same value that is used to generate the Hash Value. The value can be
the Member Number, SSN/TIN, or a CIF value defined by the FI or third-party
vendor.

Specifications:

  * Length must be 20. If the number is not 20 characters long, prepend with leading zeroes.

## Current Date

The date that the request is sent to InfoIMAGE.

Specifications:

  * The format is MMDDYYYY.

## Step 2 - SSO Key Generation

The vendor sends an HTTP POST request to the InfoIMAGE ssoKeyGen endpoint to
request for an SSO Key that will be used to sign the user into InfoIMAGE
eStatement Site.

## Return Value

On success:

key=[key string]

  

On failure:

602: Invalid Request

 **It is a business rule that InfoIMAGE will not return detailed error
messages. This is to withhold information from potential hackers.**

## Step 3 - SSO Exchange

The SSO Key is passed to InfoIMAGE via HTTP POST at the ssoExchange endpoint
to sign the user into eStatements.

### Certification Requirements

If the Home Banking application requires additional
certification/authentication methods, such as P3P, client-side certificate
authentication, and any other authentication methods, InfoIMAGE must be
informed of these requirement(s) before SSO setup begins.
