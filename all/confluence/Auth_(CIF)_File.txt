title: Auth (CIF) File
body: InfoIMAGE is a commercial printer company that provides financial institutions
with the service of composing and printing financial documents. In addition,
InfoIMAGE also provides electronic forms of the statements in either PDF or
HTML format. The eStatement department is responsible for all services and
applications that revolve around the storing and delivery of the electronic
statements.

In order to deliver an electronic statements to the end user, two core pieces
of information must be known.

  1. Which account, unique by number and type, does the statement belong to?
  2. Which user, identified by a Unique User Identifier, has access to the account that holds the statement?

The first piece of information is in the statement data itself. The statement
data provides the account number and account type, or information adjacent
that the Print team can use to determine the account number and account type.
By the time that the index file is processed, the statements' assignment to
accounts are already defined, and the Processing UI only needs to parse and
store the data.

It is the eStatement team's responsibility to work with the client to
determine how InfoIMAGE will get the second core information. There are three
methods:

  1. User entitlement to accounts is determined during the SSO handshake where the OLB platform will provide the list of the accounts that the user should have access to. InfoIMAGE will accept the list and create/update/delete the user-account relationships accordingly.
  2. User entitlement to accounts is determined by ingesting a data file, often called the Auth file or CIF file, provided by the client that will contain the user-account relationships.
  3. A combination of (1) and (2).

The purpose of this document is to provide an understanding of the Auth File,
and how it can be configured.

# General Processing Logic

This is not a comprehensive detailing of the Auth File logic, but it will
describe the key steps.

  1. Parse through the entire file to determine the amount of bad data records. If the percentage of bad records compared to the total record count is higher than a defined threshold, the entire file will be rejected.
  2.  **PreProcess** **:** Logic performed before processing each line in the file.
  3. Process each record line by line in the order provided in the file.
  4.  **PostProcess** : Logic performed after the entire file is processed.

# Data Completeness

The data processing, the client may send a full file of the true states of all
user-account relationships, or an incremental file that only contains the
delta since the last file. Data completeness is mutually exclusive by setup.
The client cannot send a full file one day and an incremental the next. It
must be always full file or always incremental files.

## Full File

For a full file processing, InfoIMAGE will assume that all the user-account
relationships defined inside the file are the only user-account relationships
that should exist.

### Pre-Process

The entire list of existing usr_mapping and usr_fin_account will be queried to
save the state of the user-account relationships. Two sets are saved: a cifSet
that stores all the cif_num, and a ufaSet that stores all the ufa_id.

There are configurations that can exclude certain sets of CIFs or UFAs. This
is important for the mixed implementation where entitlements are determined
both by the Auth file and during SSO.

### During Processing

While processing, cif_num is removed from the cifSet whenever the CIF value is
encountered. Each line inside the data file can be considered to represent the
UFA, and as such, each line will remove one ufa_id from the ufaSet.

### Post-Process

  1. Any CIF and UFA remaining inside the cifSet or ufaSet will be purged. 
    1. For ufa purging, if the ufa belongs to a primary user, then all subusers' link to the same account will also be removed. This is applicable for setups where it is a requirement that the primary user must have access to an account for the subusers to access the account.
  2. Any users that are no longer linked to at least one account will be deactivated.
    1. If the user deactivated is a primary user, all subusers will also be deactivated.
  3. For any accounts that are unlinked from a user due to the ufa purge, a check is made to see if the account is still linked to at least one other enrolled user. If the answer is no, then the account's paperless status will be changed to Paper.

## Incremental File

For an incremental file processing, an additional column needs to be included
for the Maintenance Code to define the operation to be done. There are two
operations currently supported.

  1.  **A** (dd): Add or update the user-account relationship. The users and accounts are automatically created if they do not exist already.
  2.  **D** (elete): Delete the user-account relationship. 

### Pre-Process

Nothing is done.

### During Processing

  1. Whenever a ufa is deleted, the account is checked to see if it is still linked with at least one other enrolled user. If not, the account's paperless status will be changed to Paper if the status is not already Paper.
  2. All  

### Post-Process

  1. For all primary users
