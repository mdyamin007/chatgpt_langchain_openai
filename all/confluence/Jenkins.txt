body: # Useful Info

  * Plugins are stored in /var/data/jenkins/plugins. It is a good idea to backup plugin(s) that you are attempting to update.
  * After a restart, Jenkins may need to be fixed by performing the following steps.
    1. Backup the project-inheritance plugin to a temporary location. In /var/data/jenkins/plugins/ there should be one folder called project-inheritance, and two files with the format project-inheritance.*
    2. Run these commands on ca-utils-pr-01.infoimageinc.com.

  

    3.   

Re-install Project Inheritance.

      1. Move the project-inheritance files previously saved back into the /var/data/jenkins/plugins
      2. Restart Jenkins again
