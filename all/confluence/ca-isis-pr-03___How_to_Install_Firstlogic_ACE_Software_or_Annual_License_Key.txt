title: ca-isis-pr-03:  How to Install Firstlogic ACE Software or Annual License Key
body: This is annual process towards the end of December that we need to update and
replace the First Logic postal software license key.  First Logic will send
the updated key after we made payment in for the Invoices in early December.

## Updating Annual License Key - Step-by-step guide:  

The First Logic software resides in one server only for Production.  The
following are the installation steps.

  1. In production, log into ca-isis-pr-03 (rhs2) server as root
  2. Go to /opt/postware/ directory
  3. Move and backup the /opt/postware/firstlogic.key to a temporary backup folder of your choice in the event we need to recover the license
  4. Copy the  _new_ license key from the email First Logic sent and place the new 'firstlogic.key' into /opt/postware/ folder.
  5. chmod 777 /opt/postware/firstlogic.key  #Make this file read/write/executable for all the files.

  

The following are the steps are how to test.

  1. Create a temporary empty folder.
  2. Go into the temporary folder that you just created.
  3. cp /home/util/test.srt .
  4. /home/util/acetest.sh
  5. If everything works ok, you should see a few files beginning with 'test' created in your local folder.  If you see test1.c1bmcok, then it's good.  If you don't see the file, then something is wrong and you will need to escalate the issue!  Restore the original key in the meantime if it takes time for you to escalate so that it does not impact DP production processing..
