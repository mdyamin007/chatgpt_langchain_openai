title: Cross site request forgery (CSRF) attack
body:   

## Without CSRF token

A user can easily tricked to a cloned site like the page below. The look and
feel is exactly like infotrac. But Look at the URL. It's totally different
domain. When the users put their username and password and try to login. They
will be logged in the actual infotrac site and it will work exactly the same.
But they won't even notice that they were logged in through a different system
and their credentials may be compromised.

  

  

  

## With CSRF token

  

When a user will go to a cloned site. The CSRF token will not be present in
the cloned site. So user worn't be logged into the system. Cause the CSRF is
missing or invalid. So 3rd partly site won't be able to trick the user. Only
the login page in the original infotrac will have that valid csrf token.
