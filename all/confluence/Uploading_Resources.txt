title: Uploading Resources
body: Resources will be sent as attachments via email. Additional files such as
index files and before/after samples may be sent in order to check if proper
changes were implemented on the site.

  

 **Getting started with Core FTP**

  * For first time users, click on Site Manager in the top left corner next to the lightning bolt symbol. 
  * Add a host by clicking on New Site in the bottom left corner. 
  * Create a new site for five different hosts: **afp2web-dv-01/02 and afp2web-pr-01/02/03**

  

 **How to upload resources**

  1. Save the resources to a folder on your Desktop. 
  2. Go to Core FTP and connect to any of the hosts by clicking on Site Manager in the top left, selecting a host, then clicking on Connect at the bottom of the Site Manager window. 
    * Side note: Once connected, make sure the local directory and the host are shown side by side before continuing. 
  3. On the local directory side, make sure that the resources are shown in the folder that it was saved in. 
  4. For the host side, make sure to be on the root directory **/**  before proceeding to **resource  **->  **isis-prod**. 
  5. Depending on the resource file type, here's the instructions for the next path: 

File type| Folder  
---|---  
.ovl/.ogl| ovl300  
.300| pseg  
.tif/.TIF| tiff  
  
  

  6. Once in the desired folder, transfer the resources into their respective folders by dragging or copying them over. 
  7. Once the resources are successfully transferred, connect to the other hosts and repeat the same process starting from step 2. 

  

 **Confirming changes  **

If an index file and samples are received, confirm that the updated sample
matches what is posted on the admin site. If the index file nor before/after
samples were not sent, then ask for the missing items respectively.  
This process is performed as follows:

  * Post the index file provided by IS if not auto-posted already. 
  * Click on the PUI job and look for an account number in the log file.
  * Navigate to the admin site/infotrac and search the account number.
  * Locate the statement that matches the type and closing date according to the posting.
  * Confirm the resource changes by opening the statement and compare with a sample pdf provided by IS.
