body:   

Issue Number| Action Items| Status  
---|---|---  
1\. POST /msm/proofing/action.jsp| a. It's violating the rule of: [file
"/usr/share/modsecurity-
crs/activated_rules/modsecurity_crs_41_sql_injection_attacks.conf"] [line
"77"]  
b. Based on prelim evaluation of that regular expression, I suspect the HTML
content of the email being send in somehow match the pattern.  
c. What to do: Need discussion between Network & ISD to decide. There isn't a
definite right/wrong answer here.|  
  
2\. GET /dso/MwcuSample.pdf| a. It's violating the rule of: [file
"/usr/share/modsecurity-
crs/activated_rules/modsecurity_crs_20_protocol_violations.conf"] [line "427"]  
b. It's complaining about REQUEST_HEADERS:Range "@beginsWith bytes=0-". I
don't fully understand why such detection and how the PDF fetching could cause
this.  
c. What to do: Need Network team to provide more detail of what this rule is
enforcing.|  
  
3\. GET /dso/imgGen.jsp| a. It's violating the rule of: [file
"/usr/share/modsecurity-crs/activated_rules/modsecurity_crs_50_outbound.conf"]
[line "53"]  
b. It's complaining about SecRule RESPONSE_STATUS "^5\d{2}$"  
c. Looks like the application is returning a 5xx response status?  
d. What to do: ISD Team need to look why the 5xx response code.
