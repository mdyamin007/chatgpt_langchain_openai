title: Local Tomcat Server Installation Instructions
body: This is a clean-install to set up tomcat on your local machines. This setup
mimics what is currently being used on the tomcat systems.

Setup Steps:

1\. Find the "Tomcat-clean-install" folder in path:
"\\\dell-2100\share\Isd\Local tomcat clean install". Unzip the folder to
Desktop or somewhere accessible.

2\. Create a folder ApacheTomcat in your C:\ directory (C:\ApacheTomcat\\)

2\. Move the folders tomcat-bank, tomcat-cu, and tomcat-default (tomcat-*\\)
from Tomcat-clean-install into your C:\ApacheTomcat\ folder

3\. Update file tomcat-*\conf\catalina.properties, "shared.loader=" value to
point to your own local estmt2-depends-libs and _jar_files_dev Jar locations
(all 3 tomcat-*\ folders)  
Ex: shared.loader=C:/Users/ethyu/workspace/Development/estmt2-depend-
libs/*.jar,C:/Users/ethyu/workspace/Development/_jar_files_dev/*.jar  
  
4\. (Can ignore this step if you put tomcat-* folders into C:\ApacheTomcat\
directory)  
Update tomcat-*/i3webapps/system.prop "webserver.root", "webserver.config",
"webapps.root", and "com.infoimage.api.configfile" to connect to your local
tomcat directory  
  
5\. Update tomcat-*/conf/server.xml to add in your own client. You can follow
the examples of previous server setups commented in the file.  
Copy and paste from <Host> </Host> outside of comments.  
Make adjustments to the client names, 3 instances.  
ex: "____" will depict the areas you need to replace with client name  
<Host name="____local.infoimageinc.com" appBase="i3webapps/____" and  
prefix="____-local.infoimageinc.com_access_log." suffix=".txt"

6\. Create your client folder in tomcat-*\i3webapps.  
ex: "gcbk" folder  
Move and update the logging.conf file in C:\ApacheTomcat\tomcat-bank\i3webapps
with the corresponding client's CID and copy over to the client folder you
made.  
  
7\. Checkout client code from SVN onto your workspace.  
In your eclipse workspace, "Run As 5 Maven install" the pom.xml file in your
client code folder  
Copy over the msm.war and ROOT.war files from the client target folder over to
client folder you created in tomcat-*.  
ex: "C:\Users\ethyu\workspace\Development\gcbk\target" \--->
"C:\ApacheTomcat\tomcat-bank\i3webapps\gcbk"  
  
8.Call Command: "tomcat-*\bin\setenv.bat" to set the environment path  
\- Do it in tomcat-* directory, or tomcat-*\bin\ directory

9\. On your hosts file, add  
ex: "127.0.0.1
[gcbklocal.infoimageinc.com](http://gcbklocal.infoimageinc.com)" for each of
your tomcat-* and clients  
  
10\. To start tomcat local server:  
Call Command: "tomcat-*\bin\startup.bat" to start tomcat  
\- Do it in tomcat-* directory, or tomcat-*\bin\ directory  
  
If JRE_HOME Error comes up, open setenv.bat and add line:  
set "JRE_HOME=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_79\jre"
