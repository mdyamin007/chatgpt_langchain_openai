## Executive Summary:

  * The request is to begin integration project with Jack Henry with their product name jXchange.  
  * With the help of jXchange we can help our client update the JH core directly for:
    * Enrollment status
    * Delivery preference
    * Email address etc.

## Background and strategic fit

  * InfoIMAGE tried to integrate with Jack Henry back in 2017 but at that time we were told that the core only have the delivery preference field for Checking (account type **DD** )  and Time Deposit accounts (account type **TD** ). Also we were not sure which field should we use to store the SMS number as there were about 8 possible fields in the core. 

## Assumptions

  * Jack Henry overcame the account type issue & they are now able to update the core for any given application.

  

 **Executive Approval:  **
