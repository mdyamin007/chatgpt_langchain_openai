title: ISD - Work Dependencies
body: ### Client Dependency

  1. Deliverables: Ideally, all deliverables are provided before the start of a Sprint in order for the Work to be scheduled into a Sprint.
    1. Signed Estimate: the signed estimate from the client in order for ISD to start work. Ideally, this would not be a dependency, because this should not reach ISD unless the estimate is signed, or, in the case that the client is unable to sign, a verbal agreement has been made with the client-facing team.
    2. Specifications: a document detailing the client's request. This is usually not provided, and most requests are a series of discussions between the client and InfoIMAGE. Ideally, the client would provide a specs document to InfoIMAGE.
    3. Sample Input: For processing that requires an input (index) file from the client, a sample file must be provided for testing to ensure that the client can produce the index file to meet InfoIMAGE's specs.
  2. Preferences / Decisions: After the demo during Sprint Review, the client may provide feedback on further changes / development. 

### Print Team Co-Dependency

  1. Print Process: For eStatements, eNotices, and eTaxes, the print team will need to develop the print program concurrently. 
    1. Sample Index File: a sample index file to test eStatement processing.

### QA Dependency

  1. QA: Work can only be released once QA is done, and no errors are found.
