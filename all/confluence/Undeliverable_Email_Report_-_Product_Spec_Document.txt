#### What is Product?

|

#### Product Overview

InfoIMAGE will generate a monthly report with descriptions and reason codes of
bounced emails for each application. This report also lists detailed user and
account information for the bounced emails.

#### Features Include

  * Customization of report contents, format, and/or frequency is supported for an additional charge.
  * Undeliverable Email Reports can be used in conjunction with InfoIMAGE's Pop-up alerts to trigger site alerts to the bounced user to update their email address upon their next log-in. Undeliverable email account numbers are collected after each email notification.
  * Clients on InfoIMAGE's prism platform are required to use an InfoIMAGE assigned "FROM" email address. Report is restricted to statements only.
  * Clients on InfoIMAGE's hypercube platform are able to use their own "FROM" email address. Statements, Notices, and Taxes is supported.
  * InfoIMAGE's Sender Policy Framework (SPF) record will need to be added from the client's side to allow InfoIMAGE to trigger notifications on the client's behalf.

  
  
#### Where does Product fit?

|

#### Client's Fit

This report allows clients to track bounced emails that are not reaching their
users and give detailed breakdowns on the causes of the issue. This helps
clients create solutions so their emails can target more users with new
information/promotions.

#### InfoIMAGE's Fit

This report helps InfoIMAGE keep track internally if clients' users are
repeatedly not receiving emails and the reasons for these bounced emails.
