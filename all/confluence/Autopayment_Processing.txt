\- ties auto-payment amount to bill .  
\- Auto payment doesn't care about balance sheet processing it cares more
about index(bill) file processing since that's the one which has more recent
bills  
\- When bill index file is processed, that job will be flagged in
p_bill_payment.new  
\- Important tables p_bill_payment, p_job_bill, bills, payments,
no_autopay_bill  
\- When autopayment runs the amount is schedules  
\- will be bill minimum due if user signs up for a larger amount > than min
due  
\- If a user sets up autopay and a bill is processed for an autopay.  
Then the user switches to by request and again does autopay and a new bill
comes again for which autopay is processed. Then it is possible to have two
payments within the same cycle. All of this depends on when the autopayment
days were set up each time autopay was set up
