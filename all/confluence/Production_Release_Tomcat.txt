## Step-by-step guide

Commit/Review Code

  1. Commit code.

Deploying Code

  1. Verify that no one else is currently deploying to Production on the same schema
  2. Alert the team that you are restarting "prod default", "prod bank", or "prod cu"
  3. Proceed if no one says otherwise
  4. Log into webapp-prod09 and webapp-prod10.
  5. Go to the tomcat folder for the schema that the CID is on
    1. cd /usr/local/tomcat/tomcat-* (default, bank, or cu)
  6. Tail both the latest logs for webapp-prod09 and webapp-prod10
    1. tail -f logs/catalina-yyyy-mm-dd.out
  7. Verify that both instances are running normally, i.e. there are normal traffic outputted in the logs on both webapp-prod09 and webapp-prod10
    1.   8. Take down webapp-prod09
    1. Working directory: /usr/local/tomcat/tomcat-*
    2. sudo -u tomcat bin/shutdown.sh
  9. Webapp-prod10 tomcat instance should now be taking in all the traffic
  10. Build i3-core if necessary on Jenkins
    1. i3-core-prod09
  11. Build the estmt2 code on Jenkins
    1. e.g. ewbb-prod09
  12. Verify that the Jenkins build(s) are successful
    1.   13. Start webapp-prod09 back up
    1. sudo -u tomcat bin/startup.sh
  14. Monitor webapp-prod09 logs until the server is back up and you see traffic again
  15. Repeat step 8-14 for webapp-prod10
    1.  **DO NOT** restart webapp-prod10 until webapp-prod09 has fully started up and traffic is coming in through the logs
