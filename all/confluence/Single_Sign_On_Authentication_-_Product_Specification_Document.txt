#### What is Single Sign-On Authentication?

|

#### Product Overview

The Single Sign-On (SSO) feature offered by InfoIMAGE enables users to
securely access multiple services/ products with a single set of
authentication credentials. Using this feature, a user will be able to log
into a  service/ product and access it just by signing onto the client's login
portal. In this mechanism of the feature, the authentication depends on the
client's system to determine and authenticate which user can access the
service/product.

#### Features Included

  * Multiple services and product authentication capability with a single authentication credential.
  * Direct Sign-On (DSO).
  * Automatic user account creation.
  * Users will be able to sign into the clients' preferred login portal.

  
  
#### Where does the Single Sign-On Authentication fit?

|

#### Client's Fit

The Single Sign-On feature enables clients to regulate user authentication. It
eliminates the inconvenience of creating multiple accounts and accessing them
in multiple services. Users can only sign onto the client's login portal while
the client's system controls the authorization of the user's access request.
The Single Sign-On feature simply relies on the client's authorization and
automatically handles account creation and secure authentication.

####  InfoIMAGE's Fit

The Single Sign-On feature brings simplicity while keeping the authentication
procedure secured. It provides the client the control they need for
authorizing the user and their access to any services. As the authentication
procedure is managed centrally, a single set of credentials is sufficient for
multiple services/products. It makes the whole authentication procedure faster
and easier.

# Common Questions Around Product  
  
---  
Question| Outcome  
How will a user authenticate through the SSO?| The client can generate a URL
for this feature while configuring. Clients shall provide this URL to their
users to access the authentication user interface and users should be able to
sign in to the application with their credentials.  
How will a user have their authentication credentials?| Users will have their
credentials from their respective clients. Clients shall create user
profiles/accounts in the authentication system for their users.  
Does a client have to configure anything to enable this feature?| Clients will
have to configure a relying party trust using a metadata file provided by the
InfoIMAGE.  
What will happen if a set of credentials does not belong to an existing user
account?| A new account shall be automatically created during the sign-in
period.  
Do users have to use the same credentials for both DSO and SSO-based
authentication?| Credentials do not have to be the same for both the DSO and
SSO-based authentication. Users' authentication requests are authorized and
validated by the clients' system, the target application will accept or reject
the request depending on this authorization and validation. Whereas DSO
authentication is handled by the application itself, therefore both
credentials can be different or the same.  
What does a client need to provide to enable this feature?| Clients will have
to provide their federation metadata file generated by their authentication
service (Microsoft Active Directory Federation Service).  
Can authentication credentials be changed for the SSO feature?| If the client
allows their users to change credentials in their central authentication
service (e.g. Microsoft Active Directory Federation Service), users should be
able to change it.
