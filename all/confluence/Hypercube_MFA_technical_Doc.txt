title: Hypercube MFA technical Doc
body: If the "mfaOnDso" flag is on for any client then during dso login it will do
authentication check using MFA.  

  

 **For npLinkType byUsr  client,**  it will always show the email address from
the np table that is associated with the username. Currently, the SMS option
is not available for byUsr clients MFA on DSO.

 **For npLinkType byUfa client,** it will always show both email addresses and
phone numbers from the np table record that is associated with the username.
The SMS option will show only if that client

has "smsNotification"  flag as on and has SMS number in the np table record.
If the user has a different email address and phone number for each associated
account then the authentication checkbox

will show each distinct email address and phone number for that user.

  

 **DSO MFA steps on the hypercube  **

Step  1: Go to DSO login page

Step 2: Enter the username and password then click the "Login" button.

Step 3: An authentication check window will pop up on the login page with the
previously provided email address and phone number during enrollment steps.

              User will have to choose either an email address or a phone number where an identification code will be sent to confirm the identification of the user and 

             Click the next button. A code will be sent to the chosen contact according to the client's template via email or SMS.

Step 4: User has to check their email or SMS to check the MFA identification
code. If there is no code sent to the chosen contact then there is a "Resend
code" button. So it will again send the code.

              The user has to get that MFA identification code and enter that code in the next pop up windows on the "Enter Verification Code" input field and click the "Submit" button to log in.

Step 5: If the user enters the correct identification code then the user will
successfully login on the hypercube. But if the user enters the wrong
identification code it will pop up a red alert saying "Invalid value! Please
click on resend to regenerate code".

               In this step, the user can resend the code to the previously selected contract.
