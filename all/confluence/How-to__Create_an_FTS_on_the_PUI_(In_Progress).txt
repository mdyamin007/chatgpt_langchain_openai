title: How-to: Create an FTS on the PUI (In Progress)
body: This guide is to demonstrate how to create a file schedule under the File
Transfer Status tab on the PUI.

If an AC/IM makes this request, we should ask for the following information
before proceeding. If absolutely necessary, we can sometimes find this
information ourselves in the SOW. Details will be provided in the steps to
follow.

  * Title 
  * Filename convention
  * Frequency
  * Storage location (Secure3, Secure4, etc)

## Step-by-step guide

  1. Set the title
  2. Set the scanner type aka storage location
  3. Set the filename regex pattern for the filename convention
    1. Use a regex validator to test and confirm the validity.
  4. Set the example - this can be any example filename we would expect. This field will also show up in the missing alert emails, so it might be more suitable to set a generic filename rather than a specific one (i.e. ACBK_CIF_MMDDYY.txt instead of ACBK_CIF_042022.txt).
  5. Set the Due method/Due time. There are some limitations to be aware of before committing to a certain schedule:
  6. Set the minimum files expected - most of the time this can be kept at the default value of 1, change if necessary.

  

Email types:

  * Confirmation
  * Unrecognized
  * Missing

  

You may also want to use visual panels to communicate related information,
tips or things users need to be aware of.

## Tips

  * Some clients may have a separate folder location in addition to their main (i.e. SANA has both a sana and an fis_sana folder).
  * We can also check the client_info table in the SQL Oracle db to see file schedule lists for any client.
