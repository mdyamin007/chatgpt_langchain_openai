Set up new client Whatcom Educational Credit Union. This client will have the
CID 'wecu'. This client will have hypercube and infoTrac set up and for data

 as they need a new sso method so we developed a new sso method as
**singleSignOn  **

As discussed with Bryant, we will have an initial release on the pilot with
working SSO for wecu. WECU will use **singleSignOn** sso method which is a
brand new sso method created to support their one to many, user to account
relation. This login method is created

by mirroring q2sso.

  * one to many, one to one user to account relation
  * create a new user if new CIF  is passed through sso
  * create a new account if the account doesn't exist 
  * update email through sso
