body: To Do:

  1. Sign up for an account: <https://infoimage.atlassian.net/>
    * Direct link to Department JIRA Board: <https://infoimage.atlassian.net/projects/DP/board>
  2. Determine what Redmine fields are relevant to you
    * JEF: <https://app.smartsheet.com/sheets/35R6F5qJjC7wGVPf2pM7rhw5p3r6P7m352v98CG1?view=grid>
    * TJEF: <https://app.smartsheet.com/sheets/V5xvVj2xGXHXV4q395jCHVw24JXmQfphcVfwMWf1?view=grid>
  3. Formulate your own workflow (see the images below)
    1. Note that while your own specific workflow should follow the overarching workflow (Open -> In Progress -> Done, etc.), a lot of the finer details are entirely up to your discretion. The workflow can be as simple or as complex as you need it to be. A lot of automation can also be done to ease transitions between statuses.
  4. Determine what you would like JIRA to be able to do for you
