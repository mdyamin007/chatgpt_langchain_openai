 ** _ADA Testing with Mobile:_**

 ** _Tool : TalkBack,  _**

TalkBack is the Google screen reader included on Android devices. TalkBack
gives users spoken feedback so that they can use their device without looking
at the screen.

  

 **                _Steps for Turning on Talk Bac_**

  *  **1)** For Android phones, go to Settings

  *  **7)** All gestures for TalkBack require only 1 finger. 
  *  **8)** After talk back is on it will select all the elements by wiing figure left or right, on screen user will see a green box is selected and on every swipe it will select the next one.

                                                                                             

  *  **9)** To stop talk back go to talkback with one finger swipe and double click to active the ink action.

](https://confluence.infoimageinc.com/pages/resumedraft.action?draftId=75110319&draftShareId=6625e35b-247e-4ce5-b7ec-1244c09694d6&)

 **5)** Turn VoiceOver on.

VoiceOver does require up to 3 finger gestures, and although some are similar
to Android, there are enough differences to cause some difficulty when
switching between the screen readers. The basic gestures I would use for
testing are:

 **1 finger gestures:**

      * Touch or move around the screen - speak and select the item under your finger
      * Tap 2 times fast - activate the selected item
      * Swipe left or right - selects the previous or next item
      * Swipe up or down - move to the selected rotor option

 **2 finger gestures:**

      * Swipe up - read all from the first object in selected area
      * Swipe down - read all from selected item
      * Scrub back and forth - go back, cancel, close pop-up
      * Pinch out/in - select/deselect
      * Rotate to open the web rotor and select rotor items (see the last point for 1 finger gestures)

  

 **3 finger gestures:**

      * Swipe left or right - move to previous or next horizontal screen/page
      * Swipe up or down - move/scroll down or up
