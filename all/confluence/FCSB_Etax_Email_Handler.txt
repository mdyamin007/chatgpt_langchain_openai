## Goals

  * Set up Etax Email for FCSB

## Background and strategic fit

We need to fix FCSB email handler so that their emails for eTaxes will be sent
out correctly; using NP table.

## Assumptions

  * There are 3 different cases for recipients: FHNB, FNBT, and FCB. FNBT and FCB are both under cid fnbt. 
  * Emails are only sent out once per email per account if the account is on E or W. (One account can have multiple emails if the addresses are different)
  * Emails won't be sent out to restricted NP records.
  * Emails won't be sent out if we have already sent out emails for the etax
  * We will be using the NotifyPrefEmailRecipient.
  * Reference FCSBEstmtEmailHandler.

## Requirements

#| Title| User Story| Importance| Notes  
---|---|---|---|---  
1| Query for FHNB| Define Query for FHNB|  _Must Have_|

SELECT DISTINCT e.etax_id, ufa.usr_id, ufa.acct_id, u.usr_firstname,
u.usr_lastname  
FROM p_job_etax j, etax e, usr_fin_account ufa, usr u, paperless2 p  
WHERE j.p_job_id = ?  
AND j.etax_id = e.etax_id  
AND (e.Status IS NULL OR e.Status = ?)  
AND e.acct_id = ufa.acct_id  
AND u.usr_id = ufa.usr_id  
AND ufa.acct_id = p.acct_id  
AND p.p_latest_status != 'B';

  * j.p_job_id = jobID parameter
  * e.Status = ETax.APPROVED

  
2| Query for FNBT| Define Query for FNBT |  _Must Have_|

SELECT DISTINCT e.etax_id, ufa.usr_id, ufa.acct_id, u.usr_firstname,
u.usr_lastname, fa.region  
FROM p_job_etax j, etax e, usr_fin_account ufa, usr u, fin_account fa,
paperless2 p  
WHERE j.p_job_id = ?  
AND j.etax_id = e.etax_id  
AND (e.Status IS NULL OR e.Status = ?)  
AND e.acct_id = ufa.acct_id  
AND u.usr_id = ufa.usr_id  
AND fa.acct_id=ufa.acct_id  
AND fa.region = ?  
AND fa.acct_id = p.acct_id  
AND p.p_latest_status != 'B';

  * j.p_job_id = jobID parameter
  * e.Status = ETax.APPROVED
  * fa.region = 'TX'

  
3| Query for FCB| Define Query for FCB|  _Must Have_|  Same as FNBT, but
fa.region = 'AZ'  
4| public EmailRecipient[] getRecipients (String jobId)| function to return
the email recipients to the processing job|  _Must Have_|

  * Paperless status does not need to be checked because the new query is joined with the paperless2 table and filters out all accounts on Paper ('B')
  * The specific recipient to use is NotifyPrefEmailRecipient
  * Reference FcsbEstmtEmailHandler

  
5| private Set<String> getAlreadySentEmails(String jobId)| function to return
emails already sent|  _Must Have_|

SELECT DISTINCT Email  
FROM P_Job_Etax pje, P_Etax_Email pee, etax e  
WHERE pje.P_Job_Id = ?  
AND pje.etax_Id = pee.etax_Id  
AND pee.etax_Id = e.etax_Id  
AND (e.Status IS NULL OR e.Status = ?)

  * j.p_job_id = jobID parameter
  * e.Status = ETax.APPROVED

  
6| private String setRegion (String orgName)| function to return the region|
_Must Have_|

  * fcb return "AZ"
  * fnbt return "TX"

  
7| private String getEmails(String userId, String accountId, String orgId)|
function to return the emails of a user/account pair; will filter out
restricted emails|  _Must Have_|

SELECT notification_preference_id, email_address FROM notification_preference
WHERE usr_id=? ORDER BY notification_preference_id

  * user_id = userId parameter
  * Will only return emails that are not restricted

Possible results:

  1. "": no email addresses or all email addresses are stricted
  2. "email1": email1 is not restricted; and email2 DNE or is restricted
  3. "email2": email2 is not restricted; and email1 is restricted
  4. "email1,email2": email1 and email2 are not restricted 

Not restricted => restriction entry exists in the restriction table  
  
8|

public EmailRecipient createSampleEmailRecipient (String acctNum, String
acctName, String emailAddr)

| function to return a sample recipient for Admin Site and PUI use|  _Must
Have_|  reference the same function in NotifyPrefEmailHandler  
9| public void formatEmail(PostOffice po, EmailRecipient er)| function to
format email|  _Must Have_|  reference the same function in
NotifyPrefEmailHandler  
10| public String formatEmailContent(EmailRecipient er)| function to format
email without PostOffice|  _Must Have_|

  * Support account number and tax list keyword (reference EtaxEmailHandler2)
  * Should append a salutation ("Dear ____," , reference EtaxEmailHandler2)
  * Use standard keywords: $sdv_txt_acctNum and $sdv_txt_eTaxList  

    * FCSB isn't using these, but we should set it up in case they want it in the future

  
11| Admin Site| Verify that sample email works on Admin Site|  _Must Have_|
There may be some code changes required on the Admin Site proofing.
