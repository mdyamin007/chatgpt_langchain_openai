The fields match with the required when going through normal user creation.

 **LoginId** : username; the script will automatically append the cid_. The
max length is 20, but the client can only have 15. cid4_ accounts for 5
characters,

 **FirstName** : The first name of the user, VARCHAR(32)

 **LastName** : The last name of the user. VARCHAR(32)

 **Email:  **The email address of the user. VARCHAR2(50)

 **Role:**  The role of the user; this is either the name on Admin Site or the
name of the role on InfoTRAC

  1. Given the roles by the client, we will need to change the roles into InfoTRAC role ID (Role table on InfoTRAC database), e.g. Manager for spcu has ID of 701. 
    * If the client is migrating from Admin Site, they will need to create the same roles themselves on InfoTRAC

 **Password** : password for the user. What we typically do is set all of the
users to have the same password that they can change later.
