title: Installing X-Pack on Elasticsearch
body: **To install X-Pack in Elasticsearch** :  
Stop Elasticsearch at first, then run the following command

  

bin/elasticsearch-plugin install x-pack

    
    
      
    

  
Confirm that you want to grant X-Pack additional permissions.

Tip  
Specify the --batch option when running the install command to automatically
grant these permissions and bypass these install prompts.

X-Pack needs these permissions to set the threat context loader during install
so Watcher can send email notifications.

X-Pack requires permissions to enable Elasticsearch to launch the machine
learning analytical engine. The native controller ensures that the launched
process is a valid machine learning component. Once launched, communications
between the machine learning processes and Elasticsearch are limited to the
operating system user that Elasticsearch runs as.

This plugin launches a native controller that is not subject to  
the Java security manager nor to system call filters.

X-Pack will try to automatically create a number of indices within
Elasticsearch. By default, Elasticsearch is configured to allow automatic
index creation, and no additional steps are required. However, if you have
disabled automatic index creation in Elasticsearch, you must configure
action.auto_create_index in elasticsearch.yml to allow X-Pack to create the
following indices:

action.auto_create_index:
.security,.monitoring*,.watches,.triggered_watches,.watcher-history*,.ml*

 **Now Start Elasticsearch**

  

 **bin/elasticsearch**

    
    
      
    

  

If there is an exception like following

  

 **org.elasticsearch.bootstrap.StartupException: ElasticsearchException[X-Pack
is not supported and Machine Learning is not available for [linux-x86]; you
can use the other X-Pack features (unsupported) by
setting[xpack.ml](http://xpack.ml).enabled: false in elasticsearch.yml]**

  

Fix it by adding following line in the conf/elasticsearch.yml file

 **[xpack.ml](http://xpack.ml).enabled: false**
