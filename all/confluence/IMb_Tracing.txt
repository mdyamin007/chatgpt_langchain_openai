## IS Index File Specifications

  
  

###  **Header Record**

A header record must exist on the first line in the file. Fields in this
record are pipe-delimited and they are described in the following table:

 **Field**|  **Required?**|  **Max Length**|  **Type**|  **Description**  
---|---|---|---|---  
Record Type| Required| 1| Alpha| The value of this field is "H" always  
Process ID| Required| 10| Numeric| The unique InfoIMAGE process ID generated
by IS  
Record Terminator| Required| 1| Alpha| The value of this field is "H" always  
  
Note: DT_Job_ID cannot be included as a unique identifier because jobs not set
up on InfoTRAC will not have a DT_Job_ID.  
  

  

###  **Inbound/Outbound Record**

Field schema supports both Destination IMb Tracing and Origin IMb Tracing.
Fields in this record are pipe-delimited and they are described in the
following table:

 **Field**|  **Required?**|  **Max Length**|  **Type**|  **Description**  
---|---|---|---|---  
Record Type| Required| 1| Alpha| Destination IMb Tracing = "D", Origin IMb
Tracing = "O"  
Customer Account Number| Required| 20| Numeric| Statement/document account
number. No leading zeros.

well)  
IMb Scannable| Required| 1| Alpha| Scannable = "Y", Not Scannable = "N"
Currently, only presort files will be included in the index file, so all
mailpieces will be scannable.

## Reports Needed

  1. InfoTRAC Mail Tracking Report Mock-ups: [Mail Tracking within Job Status - Mock-ups 11 19 13.docx](https://i3dev.easyredmine.com/attachments/1286/Mail%20Tracking%20within%20Job%20Status%20-%20Mock-ups%2011%2019%2013.docx?t=1384886235 "Download file")
  2. Query by an individual account within a CID, show statements under the individual account. For each statement sent, provide a link to show the trail of corresponding mapped 20-digit code.
    1. Most likely this would be integrated together with the 2D camera image query as well.
  3. On CID level, show summary reports:
    1. By Date Range (e.g. Day, Week, Month)
    2. By Geographic Locations. (e.g. zip code, city, state)
      1. Average number of days it takes mailpieces to reach different zip codes from CA or TX
      2. Zip Data can be obtained from: <http://www.unitedstateszipcodes.org/zip-code-database/>
    3. By Application
    4. Seed Mailing Statistics (for prospective clients)
    5. By Delivery Time (emphasis on slow mailpieces)
    6. Store tracking data for 90 days or more
  4. For each/combination of dimension(s) above, report attributes:
    1. Average Shipment Elapsed Time (e.g. x days)
  5. {TODO}
  6. Reports offered by Track N Trace
    1. Job Reports
      1. Mailing and Shipment - general information about the mailing
      2. Job Report by Date - counts and percentages grouped by estimated delivery date
      3. Job report by NDC/SCF/State/5 digit zip code - # of pieces delivered by estimated delivery date for each facility type
    2. Performance Reports
      1. Delivery Summary - total # of pieces delivered by zip code or state, total # and % of pieces delivered, % of pieces by state that received any scans, % of mail pieces delivered on time (by USPS standards)
      2. Delivery Statistics - speed of delivery broken down by zip code or state
      3. Delivery Barcode Scan Summary - # of business days it took an individual mailpiece to be delivered, broken down by day
      4. Delivery Exception - mis-routed (scanned at unexpected facility - not on route) and looping (scanned at the facility, sent out for delivery but somehow scanned again at the facility) exceptions
      5. US Maps (Delivery Performance) - % of pieces delivered by business day, displayed via color coding on a US map
    3. Data Exports (data export request an extract of mailpiece or scan data for all mailpieces or a selection of those pieces based on your criteria)
      1. Mailpiece export - mailpiece displayed at final scan
        1. Export criteria:
          1. All mailpieces
          2. Mailpieces that have not received scans
          3. Mailpieces without an Estimated Delivery Date
          4. Mailpieces with an Estimated Delivery Date (select date range)
          5. Zip code range
          6. Include header row
          7. Export File Delimiter (comma, tab, semicolon, pipe, caret)
          8. Email Information
          9. Can schedule automated exports
      2. Scan export - scan data for each USPS facility
