\- next estimated would be this month if nothing is processed  
\- if a bill is processed the next estimated date would be next month  
3) If today's date = eff date  
\- next estimated date would be today's date if no bill has been processed and
if it is still todays date when user logs in  
\- when user logs in and todays date has passed it would be next month if no
bill has been processed  
\- if a bill has been processed then it would be next month
