#### What are the DDA and Monthly Statements?

|

#### Product Overview

In short, a DDA or Monthly statement is a list of all transactions for a bank
account over a set period of time, usually monthly. These statements usually
include any banking activity that the customer or member has made in that
period of time. These statements also include the beginning and ending balance
for that period of time as well. Most commonly DDA Statements are referred by
InfoIMAGE to the Banking Industry while Monthly Statements are referred by
InfoIMAGE to the Credit Union Industry.

At InfoIMAGE we are the ones who facilitate the processing of putting the data
on paper for our clients.

#### Client's Fit

There are many benefits to outsourcing financial statement printing services.
The opportunity for cost savings is the primary reason most financial
institutions decide to partner with statement processing companies. However,
there are plenty of additional perks that go along with an improved bottom
line: greater accuracy and quality, targeted customer engagement, more control
over the details, the ability to expand without growing pains, and the freeing
of internal time and resources that can be redirected to the things your
financial institution does best.
