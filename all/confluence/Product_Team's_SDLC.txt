title: Product Team's SDLC
body:   * ### Planning Phase & Design Phase

    1. Sales and Marketing team collect feedback and requirement from client and submit a proposal for new product development/enhancement on confluence.
    2. Engineer manager and CEO review and approve proposal to move forward with the next step.
    3. Product team do analysis to determine what resources are required to satisfy the project requirements and any associated cost.
    4. Engineer Manager review and schedule resource and provide timeline with milestone date (Development, Piloting, Parallel, Release, Training).
    5. Based on the problem that has occurred in the past we take that into our consideration while planning for security 
    6. Classic security requirements are also part of our planning phase, like password length, API call authentication, etc.
    7. The design phase of the SDL consists of activities that occur prior to writing code. It is about quantifying an architecture (for a single feature or the entire product) and then searching for problems. This happens both formally and informally 

  * ### Coding Phase

    1. PD team begin working on project including designing of the new application, coding, 
    2. PD team meet with Marketing team to review progress and gather feedback.
    3. Offshore QA team review and test new product and enhancement.
    4. We follow Static application security testing code analysis tools such as **sonar lint** , we are also planning to introduce **SonarQube,Gitlab Code Security Check**
    5. we follow a secure coding guide(published by SEI CERT for java)
      * Input Validation and Data Sanitization (IDS)
      * Declarations and Initialization (DCL)
      * Numeric Types and Operations (NUM)
      * Characters and Strings (STR)
      * Object Orientation (OBJ)
      * Thread APIs (THI)
      * Thread Pools (TPS)
      * Runtime Environment (ENV)
      * Serialization (SER)
      * Platform Security (SEC)
      * input Output (FIO)

  

  * ### Testing Phase

    1. PD team deploy the application to Pilot environment for Sales, Marketing, and Client to review and provide feedback.
    2. with regular testing, we are periodically updating our best practice for any new attack/issue that comes up
    3. We are planning security functional Tests, Fuzz testing, vulnerability scanning, Black box testing for know vulnerabilities, and penetration testing as a formal test activity in our testing process
    4. We test for runtime resource management

  

  * ### Release Phase

    1. PD team release code to State/Parallel environment for Onshore team to review and test.

  

  * ### Deploy Phase

    1. PD team build and release code to production.

  

  * ### Operate Phase

    1. PD team provide product training to Sales and Operation team (AC, AM, IM, eServices) to ensure that operation team are ready to support the new product.

  

  * ### Monitor Phase

    1. We have runtime resource management monitoring 

    2. We check vulnerability against our existing project using **synk,** and fix the issues that we have found
