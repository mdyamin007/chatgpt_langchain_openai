title: Implementation of alternative to cookie (query parameter) fro PRISM (Clients having filter class)
body: # SSO:

## Enrollment (SSO Exchange):

  1. Get the submitted key generated from SSO Login.
  2. Decrypt the sso key and obtain the user id.
  3. Create a new encoded key using that user id and current timestamp. There will be a space between usrId and timeStamp.
  4. Get the browser information from the request header.
  5. Finally, insert the browser information and encoded key into MongoDB. After inserting get the _id of MongoDB document and set it as query parameter while redirecting the request.

## Filter Class:

  1. Inside Filter, get the _id from query parameter and pull data (sso key and browser information) from MongoDB using the _id.
  2. Validate the browser info.
  3. If browser information is valid then obtain the user id and timestamp by decrypting the ssokey data and ensure that the data is expired or not from the timestamp value.
  4. Using the user id obtain the account id and account number and store them in the request object.

## selectAcct.jsp:

  1. Inside selectAcct.jsp page create new encoded key using user id, newly selected account number, account id and new timestamp.
  2. Update the ssoKey data in MongoDB with newly created encoded key.

## Other places:

  1. In every pages while redirecting to new page add the MongoDB document _id as query parameter.
