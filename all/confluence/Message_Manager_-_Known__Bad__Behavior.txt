title: Message Manager - Known "Bad" Behavior
body:   1. Per client per application, only one Simulation request can be supported at a time. If two users happen to be reviewing the same application, and they make the Simulation request at about the same time, there might be errors. This is due to the way the Print script is setup. It is expected that the client is unlikely to have multiple users reviewing the same application at the same time, so this issue is deferred for now. When it becomes an apparent thorn in the user's experience, we will address it.
