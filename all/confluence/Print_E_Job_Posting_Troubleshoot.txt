title: Print/E Job Posting Troubleshoot
body: ## Email from David to Print team (2017-06-22) for reference:

I hope we can have a general guideline for all the team member soon as I am
seeing programmer/developer still report these issue every day and everyone is
still not sure how job to troubleshoot or why it keep failing.  
Here are my finding so far for the 2 issue related to Job Tracking and how to
troubleshoot but I do not know what need to be configure on Print side in
order to populate these data.  
Need you guy to help review and update the info below.

Issue 1: Estatement Posting Error  
Error Message: java.lang.Exception: infoTrac_flag is on but dt_job_id is
missing from dataTrac(IS) database  
Troubleshoot:  
* Make sure PC have assigned a valid DT_JOB_ID and programmer/operate used right DT_JOB_ID.  
* Check Print database to make sure data are populated correctly by running the following queries.  
select et.dt_job_id, pm.created_date  
from estmt_dt et, process_main pm  
where pm.dt_job_id = et.dt_job_id and pm.test = ? and pm.status >0 and et.cid
= pm.cid  
and et.cid =? and estmt_idx_file = ?

select INFOTRAC_FLAG from estmt_proc where ESTMT_IDX_FILE=?

* Check control file to make sure flag are turned on.  
?????

Issue 2: eStatement Posted with DT_JOB_ID but eJob Tracking is not showing up
on InfoTRAC.  
Troubleshoot:  
* Make sure eJob Tracking is turned on from PC's database by checking with the 'vid',  
select estmtjobtracking from tblAL where vid = ? and active =1
