title: LoginHandler with ldapjs and Meteormethods
body: We cand do it with ldapjs(<http://ldapjs.org/>), it is a pure JavaScript,
from-scratch framework for implementing LDAP clients and servers in Node.js.

With Meteor we only can use npm modules inside packages. we can do it in many
ways but it is better to use the solution with Meteor-NPM.  
1\. Adding NPM support to our app via Official Meteor Packaging System with
the following command.

    
    
    meteor add meteorhacks:npm
    

Now we have to restart the app once again with meteor.

2\. In the root directory of our project there are a packages.json file, we
have to list down all dependencies over there.

    
    
    {
      "ldapjs": "0.6.3" 
    }
    

  

3\. Now we can use ldapjs in server-side of our app.

    
    
     var Future = Meteor.npmRequire('fibers/future');
                var ldap = Meteor.npmRequire('ldapjs');
                var client = ldap.createClient({
                    url: 'ldap://10.11.4.130:389'
                });
