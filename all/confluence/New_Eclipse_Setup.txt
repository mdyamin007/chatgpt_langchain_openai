title: New Eclipse Setup
body: ### Stored Installs \\\dell-2100\share\Isd\ISD software\

  * eclipse-jee-mars-2-win32-x86_64.zip
  * jdk-6u27-windows-x64.exe
  * jdk-7u79-windows-x64.exe

# Java JDK Installs

Install both jdk 6 & 7\. (Note Install Path)  
  

# Eclipse Setup

Unzip eclipse-jee-mars-2-win32-x86_64.zip to desired local directory. In this
instance the eclipse directory will be 'C:\Program Files\Eclipse\'.  
  

## Set Default JDK to 1.7

MENU: Window > Preferences > Java > Installed JREs.  
Check jdk1.7.0_79 to set as default.

Double check 'tools.jar' is part of the JRE System Libraries  
Select jdk1.7.0_79 > Edit

  * If 'tools.jar' is not part of the library list. Select 'Add External JARs'. Navigate to your installed java directory 'jdk1.7.0_79\lib\'. Select 'tools.jar'

## Setting up Eclipse SVN Tools

### Install Eclipse SVN Teams Plugins.

MENU: Help > Install New Software

Work with: Mars - <http://download.eclipse.org/releases/mars>

### Open the 'Collaboration' Tab & Select

  * Subversive SVN Team Provider Services

(002.jpg)  
  

### Selecting a SVN Connector

MENU: Window > Preferences > Team > SVN

Choose the 'SVN Connector' Tab. Select 'SVNKit 1.8.14 (SVN 1.9.0 compatible,
all platforms)' as the SVN Connector.  
  

## Eclipse Workspace

To create a new Workspace  
MENU: File > Switch Workspace > Other...

### Create a workspace for each environment

  * Development
  * Pilot
  * Staging
  * Production

The following SVN Repository Setup will need to be repeated for each
workspace.  
 **Note: Be careful you are in the correct workspace before checking out code
from the repository.**  
  

## Eclipse SVN Perspective and Loading Repository

###  
  

### Connect to Repositories

MENU: Window > Perspective > Open Perspective > Other... > Select 'SVN
Repository Exploring'

On the left hand toolbar 'SVN Repositories', right click and Select 'New >
Repository Location'

### Repeat the following steps for these two repositories

  * svn+ssh:[//username@pd-tools.infoimage.com](mailto://username@pd-tools.infoimage.com)/srv/is_svn
  * svn+ssh:[//username@pd-tools.infoimage.com](mailto://username@pd-tools.infoimage.com)/srv/svn

URL: Use the above to set the protocol and location to connect to the
repository  
Authenticate with given username and password  
Check to 'Save authentication'  
Check to 'Validate Repository Location on finish'

Select 'Finish'. Re-Enter password if prompted.  
  

### Checkout Code from Repositories

To checkout code from the repository. Locate the item you want to pull > Right
Click > Select 'Checkout'  
  

#### Development Environment

The development environment pulls and pushes to the 'trunk'.

### Checkout from the 'is_svn' (004.jpg)

  * afp2pdf
  * dp
  * i3-core
  * infoimage-commons
  * processing-ui
  * resin-pro  _(always pull from trunk)_

### Checkout from the 'svn' (005.jpg)

  * app-depend-libs > estmt2-depend-libs
  * estmt2 > common

###  
  

#### Pilot / Staging/ Production

Each of the pilot, staging, and production environment are in separate
branches (all lowercase).  
Files pulled from the 'svn' repository will remain the same.  
Files pulled from the 'is_snv' repository will need to be selected from the
respective 'branch' environment name (lowercase).  
 _resin-pro is always pulled from is_svn trunk_

 **Note: Be sure when checking out code that you are in the correct workspace
before pulling files from the repository.**

## Fixing Project Explorer

###  
  

### Hierarchical View

Select the options drop-down in the 'Project Explorer'  
> Package Presentation > Hierarchical

This will collapse the external libraries so instead of seeing 40+
'com.infoimage.processing.application' packages we can get a drop-down of each
step.

### Working Sets

We can group projects into a Resource called 'Working Sets'.

Select the options drop-down in the 'Project Explorer' (008.jpg)  
DROP-DOWN > Select Working Set...  
New > Resource  
The 'Edit' option will bring you to the same window as New, only with an
editable Set already created.

Name/Rename the Resource and add/remove the contents of the set.

In this case we'll create two Sets :

### Core Code

  * afp2pdf
  * dp
  * i3-core
  * processing-ui

### Dependencies

  * common
  * estmt2-depend-libs
  * infoimage-commons
  * resin-pro

The last step is to set the 'Project Explorer' to view the working sets.  
Select the drop-down options 'Top Level Elements > Working Sets'

# Building the Code

## Ant

Apache Ant is a build tool used to create artifacts in an automated fashion.

To build a project find the 'build.xml' in the project root directory. Right
click on the file and select 'Run As -> Ant build'.  
  

### Build Order

### Due to dependencies we must build the projects in the following order

  1. afp2pdf
  2. i3-core
  3. processing-ui
  4. dp

Artifacts are produced and store in your workspace directory
'\workspace\<development | pilot | staging |
production>\\_jar_files_${environment}\'

Where environment is 'dev', 'pilot', 'staging', or 'prod' based on build.xml.
(Which is another reason to be sure you checkout environments from the correct
branch.)
