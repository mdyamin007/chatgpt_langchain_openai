title: User Unenrollment Script
body: ## Objective:

To unenroll a single user of a particular CID or all users of a CID.

## Goal:

If we unenroll a user, three tables will be affeted.  

  1.  **USR_SESSION** : SESS_LASTLOGIN, SSO, DSO will be set to null
  2.  **PAPERLESS** : Paperless history will be deleted except the one for paperless2 created 
  3.  **PAPERLESS2:**  Will set P_LATEST_STATUS='B' and P_OLD_STATUS='N'

##  Development:

  * config.properties file contains the configurable credentials. In this file, all information like cifNumber, organization name, whether we want to unenroll a single user or not are  needed to be provided. If this file doesn't contain anything, default values will be used.
    *  **orgName** : Name of the Cid whose users is needed to be unenrolled. **By default its set to 'demo'**
    *  **cifNumber** : cif_number of a user. **By default its value is set to '123457'**
    *  **singleUser** : Its a flag to determine whether we want to unenroll a single user or all users of a cid. **By default its set to true.** If singleUser is set to false, All users will be unenrolled.
    *  **testMode** : Its a flag to determine whether we want to commit the changes in the database or not. If it's set to true, changes won't be committed to the database.If it's set to false, changes will be committed to the database. **By default, its value is set to false.**
  * logs will be printed on Updatelog.log file

To run this script, run the Unenroll.java file as a normal java program.
