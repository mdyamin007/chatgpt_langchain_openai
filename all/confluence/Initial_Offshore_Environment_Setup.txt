title: Initial Offshore Environment Setup
body: ## Source Control Management

  1. Upon successful CVS-to-SVN migration. Need to establish new isolated branch for Offshore team to access and commit changes
  2. Need on-shore staff to perform code-merges via SVN-merge capability for integration builds.

  
  

## eStatement Setup

  

### Data File Management:

  1. Need sign off from Senior Management Board that we will be sharing our client's customer data w/ offshore team (This is because testing w/ our client's 3rd party vendor requires using live customer data which can include account number, social security numbers, date of birth and other personalized identify information, etc) This is a risk point that I need to emphasize.
  2. Our staff will spend time to truncate the number of data records that offshore team can use.

### Database Management:

  1. Separate Schema will be made available to offshore team that contains the isolated data elements described above in the Data File Management section.

  

### eStatement Web & Application Server:

  1. Need a separate Web and Application server environment for development. This is so that the database passwords for the other schema containing a full set of live data is made available.

  

### AFP2Web Server

  1. It will be US team responsibility to manage the setup of the statements resource files.

  

### Processing UI Server:

  1. Need a separate PUI system so that the log files for other schemas are not viewed. It contains customer live data elements in the log files.

  

### Exchange Email Server:

  1. This can be shared w/ Offshore team (i.e. No action needed in this area to support offshore team)

  

### eFax Server:

  1. Will require US team to configure as well as set up the resources for the Fax Coversheet.
