#### What is Mortgage Statement?

|

#### Product Overview

In short, a Mortgage statement is a loan Statement for a bank account over a
set period of time, usually monthly. These statements usually include any
payment activities that the customer or member has made in that period of
time, payment includes partial payment, principal, fees, and interest. These
statements also include the beginning and ending balance for that period of
time. Most commonly InfoIMAGE refers to Mortgage Statements for the Banking
Industry and Credit Union Industry.

At InfoIMAGE we are the ones who facilitate the process of transforming the
data we receive to what is shown on paper for our clients.

#### Client's Fit

There are many benefits to outsourcing financial statement printing services.
The opportunity for cost savings is the primary reason most financial
institutions decide to partner with statement processing companies. However,
there are plenty of additional perks that go along with an improved bottom
line: greater accuracy and quality, targeted customer engagement, more control
over the details, the ability to expand without growing pains, and the freeing
of internal time and resources that can be redirected to the things your
financial institution does best.

2| IS - Print Team|  **Suppression Handling Standard:**  Data-driven
suppression logic within core statement data files| Our setup includes adding
logic to identify which statements can be suppressed from the print steam.

data that routinely changes each cycle, it will require additional programming
efforts and is not included in the standard setup.|

is not included in the standard setup.|
