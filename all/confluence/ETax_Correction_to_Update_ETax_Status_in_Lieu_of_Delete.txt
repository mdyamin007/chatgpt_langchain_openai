## Goals

  * Update the ETax Correction/Replacement process to update the eTax entries to an unviewable status instead of deleting the eTaxes out right

## Background and strategic fit

Preserving the ETaxes allow InfoIMAGE to provide clients with the ability to
view corrected ETaxes as a billable feature.

## Assumptions

  * ETaxes with a status of 7 or ETax.CORRECTED will not be viewable. 
    * Prism sites DML packages only pulls ETaxes with a status of 9 or null 
  * Accounting will want to count corrected accounts for billing.
    * Current accounting report pulls from p_job.GOOD. Changing the ETax status will not affect this.
  * A replacement job will not post any new eTaxes unless it is to replace existing ones.

## Requirements

#| Title| User Story| Importance| Notes  
---|---|---|---|---  
1| Add a static value of ETax.CORRECTED| Update i3core ETax with static int
ETax.CORRECTED = 7|  _Must Have_|  
  
2| Update replacement logic| Update replacement logic to replace instead of
delete|  _Must Have_|  final String correctETAX_QUERY = "UPDATE etax SET
status = ? WHERE acct_id=? and etax_type=? AND etax_stamp=? AND (status is
null or status != ?)";  
//final String deleteETAX_QUERY = " DELETE FROM etax WHERE acct_id=? AND
etax_type=? AND etax_stamp=? ";  
//final String deleteARCH_FILE_QUERY = " DELETE FROM arch_file WHERE
arch_file_id=? ";  
//final String deleteETAX_SUFFIX_QUERY = " DELETE FROM etax_suffix where
etax_id=? ";  
//final String deleteP_ETAX_EMAIL_QUERY = " DELETE FROM p_etax_email where
etax_id=? ";  
//final String deleteP_JOB_ETAX_QUERY = " DELETE FROM P_JOB_ETAX where
etax_id=? ";  
final String countQUERY = " SELECT etax_id, arch_file_id FROM etax WHERE
acct_id=? AND etax_type=? AND etax_stamp=? AND (status is null or status !=
?)";  
3| Replacement job will skip all entries that it cannot replace | Store acct
numbers to be replaced in a HashSet and only process entries for those acct
numbers, skipping the rest. |  _Must Have_|

Skipped entries will be outputted as Warnings.  
  
## User interaction and design

Include any mockups, diagrams or visual designs relating to these
requirements.

## Questions

Below is a list of questions to be addressed as a result of this requirements
document:

Question| Outcome  
---|---  
When a replacement job SKIP, it is still added to the GOOD count, should that
be the case? If so, DP might not know the replacement failed.| SKIP will now
become WARNING  
  
## Not Doing

  * List the features discussed which are out of scope or might be revisited in a later release.
