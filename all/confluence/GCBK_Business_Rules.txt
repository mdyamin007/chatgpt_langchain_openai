# User Enrollment

* * *

## Enrollment Status

For GCBK SSO, the enrollment status is determined by whether there's SSO date
or if the sess_active_status is "new". The "new" status is inserted by the
Auth file.

## Reconciliation with Auth File

GCBK has a Full Auth File, so sometimes, SSO might create users and accounts
that are not in the Auth File (delay in processing/data by the client). In
order to prevent the users/accounts from being unlinked/deactivated, GCBK has
an expiration date logic, where user-account relationships that do not exist
in the Auth File will not be purged for 7 days after the usr_fin_account was
first created (ufa_expirationdate).

# Email Restriction

* * *

The client can restrict emails from being sent out to users (by NP/UFA), so
that even if the account is on Electronic, the user will not receive an email
each cycle.
