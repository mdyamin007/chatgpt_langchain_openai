title: Account Type validation
body: [Debit and Credit Card Number For
Testing](https://i3dev.easyredmine.com/projects/embedded_payments/wiki/Debit_and_Credit_Card_Number_For_Testing)

We do validate is the card debit or credit? If the user chose the credit card
option on the UI and trying to make a payment using his debit card, the
validation will be failed and the actual payment would not be requested in
that case.

    
    
        private String getPaymentSrcType(String cardType, String authCardL, String authCardB) {

                if("C".equals(authCardB)) {
                    return PaymentSourceType.CREDIT.getName();
                }

    *FW: Differentating Debit card from credit card*
    *New merchant number information for testing*
    From Alok: 
    These 4 variables in EPX terminology are called 4 part key which is setup for a new merchant getting added in our case mostly it would be a new CID.
    
    Please go through the mail below and use this for testing going forward.
    
    Please use these credentials and card numbers below.  After further though, please only use AUTH_CARD_B to decipher if a credit card, Visa=C and MasterCard=MCC, all other returned values are fine for you to process.  AUTH_CARD_L is used for Visa based transactions.  The reason you were not receive the auth_card fields back in the response is because the generic paypage credentials you are using does not have enhance response enabled.
    
    4 part key 
    CUST_NBR=7000
    MERCH_NBR=700012
    DBA_NBR=1
    TERMINAL_NBR=1
    
    Visa Debit:             4001150020000000
    Visa Credit:            4001150030000024
    
    MC Debit:              5000000000000009
    MC Credit:             5111201111111117   (give this an hour for our database to publish the records prior to use)
    
    Thanks,
    
    *Here is how we will differntiate between debit and credit cards*
    From Alok: 
    
    Enable enhanced response by sending VERBOSE_RESPONSE=Y in all your card transactions in EPX call and then utilize AUTH_CARD_B and ATUH_CARD_L. 
    As of now EPX is not returning either AUTH_CARD_B or ATUH_CARD_L when I used the server html.  Assume you would receive and create your logic based on that.
    Make this configurable as well per CID whether we are going to allow debit card or credit card or ACH transaction. I will elaborate more on this later.
    
    Thanks
