title: Project Setup
body: Check out the project trunk(dev version) from project svn+ssh://<svn
username>@[pd-tools.infoimage.com/srv/svn/hypercube/trunk](http://pd-
tools.infoimage.com/srv/svn/hypercube/trunk).  
as a SVN project in Eclipse which should already be configured with svn plugin
and connectors.  
Make sure that maven is locally installed.  
Go to command line and issue the following commands from the project path(ex :
C:\Users\<user>\workspace\hypercube>) in the workspace :  
 **mvn clean**  (downloads and configures the mavenized dependencies locally
in the repository from Central)  
 **mvn eclipse:eclipse -Dwtpversion=2.0**  (which should update the .classpath
and .project files for the project with maven dependencies)  
 **mvn clean compile / mvn clean package**  (Note : This is just for
reference.It is not required to build from command line ,would be done mostly
using the IDE build functionality)

Refresh the projevct and then it can be deployed locally using an embedded
server on IDE or anywhere else.  
It also corresponds to the same on Jenkins job named "hypercube" which builds
and deploys on Tomcat 7 on [pd-dev2.infoimage.com](http://pd-
dev2.infoimage.com)  
at url  **<http://pd-dev2.infoimage.com:8881/hypercube-1.0>**

Static Paths for  **Client Configuration files**  :
