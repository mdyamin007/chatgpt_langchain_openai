## Goals

  * Set up external id mapping for all 14 cids of FCBT.

## Background and strategic fit

Client's request

## Assumptions

  * The client will send 1 file to be processed under FCBT

## Requirements

  
| Title| User Story| Importance| Notes| Pilot| Production  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
1| Ext Id Map Processing| As an ExtIdMap process, I would like to be able to
process an index file belonging to a parent cid that contains information for
all sub-CIDs.|  _Must Have_|

  * add global.pseudoCid=fcba
  * add global.subCids=agal,agfc,agnm,alfc,cafc,ctfc,hlbk,laca,lalb,lsac,milb,plba,sagc,txfc
  * if the client has a pseudoCID, any CID reference to the parent CID will use the pseudoCID instead, i.e. insertion to FCBT will be into FCBA
  * if the client has subCID, leave the setting of org_id in the IdMap Object to the Handler; otherwise set the org_id to the process org (use pseudo-cid if exists)
