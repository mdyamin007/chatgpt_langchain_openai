*The mapper attachments plugin*: The mapper attachments plugin lets Elasticsearch index file attachments in common formats (such as PPT, XLS, PDF) using the Apache text extraction library Tika. We can install this plugin using the plugin manager. go to the elastic search bin directory and run following command:  
@sudo bin/plugin install mapper-attachments`  
The plugin can be removed with the command `sudo bin/plugin remove mapper-
attachments  
`

  

 **Monitoring the Elastic Stack** : We can easily monitor Elasticsearch
through Kibana. We can view our cluster's health and performance in real time
as well as analyze past cluster, index, and node metrics  
The X-Pack monitoring components enable us to easily monitor the Elastic Stack
from Kibana. We can view health and performance data of Elasticsearch and
Kibana in real time, as well as analyze past performance.
