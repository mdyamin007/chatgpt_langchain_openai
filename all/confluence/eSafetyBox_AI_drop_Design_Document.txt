title: eSafetyBox AI drop Design Document
body: # Introduction

  

## Purpose/Objective Summary

The three main pieces of functionality to be developed based on this
documentation:  
1) Financial Institution(FI) can drop a doc to End User(EU)'s eSafetyBox  
2) eStmt/eSafeBox Enrollment/Account Closure  
3) DB Migration from Oracle DB to Cassandra(including data model change)  
  

## Scope

  

### In Scope

Component| Details| Need For| Resource needed  
---|---|---|---  
AI-drop capability| backend database + app logic changes to support "Sending
file from Admin to Member(s)"| Business| Lin: 5 weeks  
Acct Enroll & Closure| Update the eSafetyBox Acct status state life-cycle to
support newly drafted state-diagram| Business| Lin: 3 weeks  
Virus Scan Engine re-design & integration| Change the architecture of how
Virus Scan Engine is utilized.  
Affect how new files are uploaded correspondingly.  
Also need to adjust application to support off-line scanning| Engr.
Functional| Lisa: 4 weeks  
Swift Integration| Setup Swift environment  
Update eSafetyBox code to CRUD files with Swift| Engr. Scalability| Lisa+Lin:
3 weeks each  
Cassandra Integration| Utilize Cassandra to handle 'File' and 'Activity Log'
entity records| Engr. Scalability| Dharmi+Lin: 3 weeks  
Member Acct Mgmt| If building the AI-drop functionality in InfoTRAC, we need
to build the Member Acct. Mgmt functionality in InfoTRAC.| Ripple of InfoTRAC|
Niraj: 5 weeks  
eSafetyBox Reports| If building the AI-drop functionality in InfoTRAC, we need
to rebuild the eSafetyBox status report, access report, usage report in
InfoTRAC.| Ripple of InfoTRAC| Lin: 2 weeks  
Admin User Mgmt| Building this in InfoTRAC introduce complexity of sync-ing
"Admin User accounts in InfoTRAC" & "Admin User accounts in eStmt DB".
Synchronization might not be trivial especially when both InfoTRAC and eStmt
AI are active.| Ripple of InfoTRAC| Pending actual design: maybe ~2 weeks  
Two-way Drop Func| backend database + app logic changes to support "Send
Back"| Business| Lin: 2 weeks  
  
  

### Functionality break-down between InfoTRAC and eStmt AI

InfoTRAC| eStmt AI  
---|---  
eSafetyBox Admin Drop-files {TODO}|  
  
eSafetyBox Member Acct Query {TODO}| eStmt Member Acct Query  
  
| eStmt Member Statement views  
  
| Email Proofing  
  
| Email Reminders  
eSafetyBox usage reports {TODO}| eStmt usage reports  
  
  
  

### Out-of-Scope

The financial institution's end users who receive files from Administrators
will not be able to 'respond' or send files back to the financial
institution's administrator at this time. This '2-way' file sending will
likely be added soon.

latest version of Chrome.

# Requirements

  

## Business Requirements & Use Cases

 **TODO:**   **(Required)**  List out all needs/requirement from business/end-
user perspective. Assign an ID for each requirement/use-case item for easier
reference in future

Please see attached file for screen shots: eSafetyBox AI Drop Screen

ID| Title| Details| ScreenMock| Importance  
---|---|---|---|---  
BRQ-01| Generic Search box| (example)  
 **Requirement:**  Instead of showing a drop-down to ask user to choose what
attribute to search against,  
just have a simple search box that will search against all potential
attributes like name/email/address/phone.  
 **Use Case:**  enter "ben" into search box, search results returned should
include both record of "Ben
[Chan/bchan@infoimage.com](mailto:Chan/bchan@infoimage.com)" as well as "Jim
[Wong/jwong@bigben.com](mailto:Wong/jwong@bigben.com)"| <attach file>| one of

 **TODO:**   **(Required if involve big architectural change)**  List out the
key class/method created/changed for this project. Highlight the changed
portion (e.g. additional param for a method)

 **Overview:**   **TODO:**  Provide an overview of what changes if not already
illustrated in the Architecture diagram above

# Additional Use Cases

 **Here are some additional Use Cases that came up during iterative
development life-cycle for phase 1** :

1) End User file send (back) to admin - Inbox and Outbox concept  
2) AI recall of an uploaded file  
3) AI dashboard with all files sent  
4) AI drill down view of which users each file was sent to, and which users
viewed/downloaded file  
5) Email notification when end user receives a file  
6) Report to show AI user which member has eSafetyBox.  
7) Nagios inegration to monitor load, traffic, CPU, memory, volume of usage,
event tracking etc  
8) Access eSafetyBox web app through mobile device, such as IOS, Android etc  
9) Member can share document to another member (Phase 2)  
10)Multi-tenant solution for eSafetyBox  
\- eSafetyBox itself is a stand-alone application  
\- template management to separate css styles from .jsp  
11)Send secure message, not just secure document (Phase 2)  
12)AI can undo sent file action, if the member hasn't viewed the file yet
