# Data Filtering

The report support some standard data filtering in the case that the client
does not want the statuses for all accounts.

Filter| Description  
---|---  
Delivery Preference| The report can be filtered by the delivery preference, so
that, for example, a report that only contains accounts on Electronic can be
generated.  
Modified Date| The report can be filtered by the modified date. A time range
is defined so that the report will only contain records of accounts that had
their statuses changed within the time range, e.g. the last 30 days.  
Account Type/Subtype| The report can be filtered by the account types and
subtypes. This mean it can fulfill request such as "Statuses only for Checking
accounts".
