### Database Migration

 **USR_SESSION** : Account number as sess_login_id. DSO is not null. Migration
needed.  
 **USR_MAPPING** : 2168 data. Might be inserted by the DOC process. Migration
needed.  
 **NOTIFICATION_PREFERENCE** : No data. Uses CONTACT_INFO table. Migration
needed.

### SSO (signlesignon7)

#### SignleSignOn7Servlet

  * As updateEmail is false, email is not mandatory to submit along with encrypted data.
  * Only account number is needed for successful SSO, email is not mandatory.
  * Account number will be 10 characters long. If the account number is less than 10 characters, then appends leading zero to make 10 characters. [ in web.xml, accountDigits=10 ]
  * Searches user with account number via loginFinder. 
    * Retrieve usr_id from USR, USR_SESSION table where sess_login_id = account number (with leading zeroes). 
  * If user is found, 
    * Retrieve login(session) from USR, USR_SESSION table by usr_id. 
  * If the user is not found then login does not exist.
    * As createLogin is false, it will not create a new USR or USR_SESSION record. It will throw an exception - "login not found". 
  * Does not update email while sso. [ in web.xml, updateEmail = false ]
  * Generate sso_key and set that in the USR_SESSION table as sso_key. 
  * Returns the key to submit in wc_hblogin.jsp page.

#### wc_hblogin.jsp

  1. Get the key from the request. 
  2. The user is searched by this sso_key in the USR_SESSION table. 
    1. If not found, no null check is found in the code. A NullPointerException will occur while getting the user session. 
    2. If found, 
      1. Set sso_key to null in the USR_SESSION table.
      2. Set the current date to the SSO column. 
      3. loginSession will be set to browser session. 
      4. Redirects to 'home.jsp'.

### DSO

  1. DSO login page exists but no dso user id is found in the production database. 
  2. Access log does not have any hit on /login.jsp. 
  3. Prism code-base does not have any dso folder, which usually holds the dso codes. 
  4. Production database has dso dates, which can be inserted by backend process XML, which uses old logic AFP registrar. 
  5. We can conclude that **CTCU does not have DSO login**. 

### **Leading Zero Account**

During SSO, leading zeros are appended if the account number is less than 10
characters long.

### Welcome Email

N/A

###  **Enrollment**

One step:

  1. Disclosure/Agreement:
    1. An agreement to receive statements electronically is shown. 
    2. Clicking the "Agree" button will set the paperless status to E and redirect to the home page. 
    3. Clicking the "Disagree" button will close the tab.

### Enrollment Logic

  * If the paperless status of the account is U(new) or B(paper), then the user will go through enrollment. It is checked in the home.jsp page. 

### Statement Types & Archival Period

Three types of statements are

  * ESTMT_DOC: default, visa ==> 24
  * ENOTICE: N/A
  * ETAX: etax ==> 24

No inserts.

### Delivery Preference

  1. Paper = B, Paperless = E, New = N, U(Used as new before 2012) (From Database)
  2. Users will be unable to view statements while on paper. 
  3. In the PAPERLESS2 table, 3 latest status  'E', 'B' and 'U'. 
    1. From ROOT, MSM and PUI processes, no 'U' is being inserted/updated. 
    2. No undeliverable report. 
    3. This client does not have 'both' or 'preenroll' as delivery preference. 
    4. From the codebase, 'U' is being treated as 'N'(new). 
    5. From the database, the records with 'U' as p_latest_status have p_modified_date the year 2012 or before.

### Notification Preference

  * Only Email is supported.
  * Uses CONTACT_INFO table. No data in NOTIFICATION_PREFERENCE table.

### Paperless Configuration

Non-Selective. Can't assign different emails for different statement types.

### NP Link Type

byUSR. Uses CONTACT_INFO table. So, only usr_id is stored.



### Menu Tabs

  *  **Review Statements**
    * Combined Statements, Visa Statements, eTax Statements. 
    * Shows full account number with leading zero(s). 
    * No inserts. 
    * Shows Helpful Hints. 
    * Account name is shown.

    * Email and delivery statements are shown here (instead of Profile page).
      * Clicking the 'update' link to change the email address shows a form to insert the new email address and another field to re-enter. 
      * Clicking the 'here to start' link to change the delivery preference opens a pop-up window which shows a confirmation message. Agreeing that will change the delivery preference. 
  * **Disclosure**
    * Shows the agreement to receive disclosures electronically. (disclosure/disclosure_pop.jsp)
  *  **Statement Rights**
    * Shows the billing rights for default(Combined) statements (disclosure/rights_pop.jsp)

## Analysis Summary (ROOT)

Scope| Feature| CTCU Business| Hypercube| Note  
---|---|---|---|---  
SSO| User Enrollment Logic|

If the paperless status of the account is U(new) or B(paper), then the user
will go through enrollment. It is checked in the home.jsp page.

 **Note** : Previousely CTCU might use 'U' for new account's paperless status
instead of 'N' before 2012. Also previously they might had undeliverable
report which might change the paperless status to 'U' for those account who
have undeliverable email addresses. Admin site has an option to delete the
email addresses for undeliverable emails.

|  53 complete **Alternatively Supported** 54 incomplete Not Supported |

In Hypercube, a user goes through enrollment if he/she never logged in via SSO
(no date in sso column).

Client will use default (sso date based) enrollment logic. Also, if user will
go to paper he/she will be forced un-enrolled.

Misc|

  * Users will hit on / **WESCOMSSO,** which is mapped to the servlet( **SingleSignOn7Servlet** ).
  * During SSO, new account, user, ufa, session and paperless records will not be created (createLogin = false). Sets sso date. Does not put dso date. 
  * Account numbers have to be 10 characters long. If it is less then 10 characters, then it will be zero-padded at the front. Database stores them with leading zero(s).
  * Email is not mandatory during sso and is not being updated (updateEmail = false).
