title: Target Groups
body: Priority order from 1 to 10 , 1 being the highest in priority and 10 being the
lowest. Default will always be the last e.g for 5 target groups for default TG
priority number would be 5 and for 10 target groups the default TG priority
number would be 10.  
The limitation on print side of 1 bye/character for priority number will be
handled on IS side.

Target group priority order enhancement from 1 to 62 will follow the same
logic 1 being highest and 62 being lowest. Lowest target group will always be
the default. IS needs to handle the conversion of double digit priority
numbering to single byte character as this is a limitation on print side.
