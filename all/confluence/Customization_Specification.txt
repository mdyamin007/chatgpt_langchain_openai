body: # Generic Payment Portal Specification

## 2014-01-07 Spec Draft:

### New Set up Summary:

Brian from Nordis wants to develop a generic payment portal that can be used
(in-line) on multiple Hospitals website by Staff members. This is designed for
patients that are brand new and getting a account number created at that very
moment (not yet a part of the balance sheet we typically receive). The
hospital staff would be entering this information for the patient. Potentially
down the road, they envision a "generic portal kiosk" where a patient can
actually sit and make this payment themselves, after being checked in with a
new account number created.
