##  **PRISM SITE ANALYSIS**

* * *

 **Additional Feature:** When a user with 'pre-enroll' status logs in, they
will see the disclosure page. If the user agrees to the disclosure, the status
will be set to 'active' and they will not see the disclosure again. If the
user choose to disagree to the disclosure, they will still be redirected to
the statement page, but the disclosure will be shown to the user when they
logs in again.

Note: Not supported in the hypercube, will need to discuss how should we
handle this logic or whether should we support this logic if they migrate to
the hypercube.

  * The account number is masked during so enrollment but nowhere else throughout the member site
  * option 2nd email is not supported
  * Assisted Employee name not supported during sso enrollment.
  * Enrollment finish page
  * Zip Code ( _stored in Contact_info from auth_ ) is required for DSO login and sign up, but not supported in the hypercube.
  * Home page disclosure doesn't match with the archival period for default, analysis and heloc, it says 7 years but actual is 25 months.
  * in profile page shows "Account Holder Name" Not supported in hypercube
