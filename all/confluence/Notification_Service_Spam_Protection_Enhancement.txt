## Draft proposal:

1\. Add following properties to property file of notifyservice

> a.  **spam.protection.enforced.cids**  = demo,fffc,mtro spam protection
> functionality will be applicable for these CID only)  
> b.  **spam.protection.enable**  = true/false (override spam protection
> functionality)  
> c.  **spam.protection.enforced.appids**  = marketing,offer (Comma separated
> appId(s) will be count for spam protection)  
> d.  **spam.protection.time.interval.inhours**  = 24  **(Default)**  
>  e.  **spam.protection.interval.max.notif**  = 1  **(Default)**
>

>> For property d and e, if no client specific property set then service will
allow to send maximum 1 notifications in last 24 hours/1 day as default.

2\. Client specific properties can be added to notifyservice

> f.  **spam.protection.time.interval.inhours.demo**  = 120  
> g.  **spam.protection.interval.max.notif.demo**  = 3
>

>> For property f and g, for demo cid, service will allow to send maximum 3
notifications in last 120 hours/5 days

>
> h.  **spam.protection.time.interval.inhours.ewbb**  = 48
>

>> For property h and e, for ewbb cid, service will allow to send maximum 1
notification in last 48 hours/2 days (As no max notification in interval has
set in property so that default settings will be considered)

2\. Add a optional parameter to  **enableSpamProtection**  (Default : false,
it will override the notifyservice.properties settings )  
3\. While processing CSV, process will check appId and
**enableSpamProtection**  param to set  **needSpamProtection**  flag.  
4\. If needSpamProtection is true then, before sending notification, query to
notification collection with appId, to address and spam protection time
interval for that cid.  
5\. If record(s) found and record(s) count is greater then or equals to
**spam.protection.interval.max.notif/.${cid}**  (maximum notification allowed
to be sent in spam protection internal time) then, skip that notification and
set the Status as SKIP. Considering SKIP status as a success notification as
like UNSUBSCRIBE. But at  **notification.reason**  property there will be a
message  **Skipped due to spam protection.**. Crossing failed threshold of a
job will depend on failed and skipped notification.
