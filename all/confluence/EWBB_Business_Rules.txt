# ACI Users

* * *

## SSO

EWBB currently only use one SSO connection, which is the ACI SSO. This
connection is used by Commercial customers.

The ACI SSO is XML based in the request, so the request data will look a bit
different. However, once the request is parsed, the logic follows the standard
SingleSignOn7.

## DSO

Before SSO, ACI Users used to be created for DSO on the Admin Site. This is
what the ACI Management tab is for. These are all legacy users, and there
should only be a few DSO users left.

# Account Sub-Type

* * *

EWBB has a unique rule where some accounts can be changed to a different
"account type". For example, one day, the account can be a Checking, but the
next, it can be converted to a Savings. Despite this, EWBB still wants to be
able to post statements to the same account. Therefore, a system was set up to
keep the TYPE the same. The SUBTYPE field is used to differentiate between the
different descriptions.

The DOC_DESC table provides the account descriptions for the subtypes.

The EXT_TYPE_MAPPING table provides the mapping from external (subtype) to
internal (type), e.g. DD -> 01.

When the client provides data files, they will always provide with the
external types, which must be mapped to an internal type. Errors can arise if
an external type is unrecognized, i.e. no entry in the EXT_TYPE_MAPPING table.
