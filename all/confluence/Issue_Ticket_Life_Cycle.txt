title: Issue Ticket Life Cycle
body:   

## What should be tracked via an Issue Ticket?

Currently there are 'Task', 'Bug', 'Enhancement' trackers to identify what
type of issue is. If need to have more categorization, please contact Redmine
Administrator.

Tracker| Examples  
---|---  
Task| Research on feasibility  
Environment Setup  
Bug| Bug found during regular QA cycles  
Enhancement| New Feature/Product  
Enhancement to existing product/feature
