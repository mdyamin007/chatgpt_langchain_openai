title: Full Integration / Parallel on Pilot - QA notes
body:   

## Meeting with Tien (5/29/2013)

  * Ensure test data in data file can be partitioned suitably for testing. Can eStatement Selective Inserts datafile be reused? (Check with Lin) -  _Lin says "no", 'Demo' not set up for MM on IS side; Lin set up only selective inserts logic for Demo's Monthly Visa application; to ask Tien for an alternative application that has MM set up_
  * As long as the index file is generated  _AND_  the resource naming conventions are adhered to (i.e. compatible with MM2.2), there should be no changes in Papyrus processing.
  * Dynamic Variables are  _out of scope_  for this run. If not, Tien needs to understand how it would affect Papyrus processing first.
  * Tien will instruct DP to grab resources from Pilot instead of Staging

  
  

## TO DO (discuss with Ben/Raja)

  1. Demo Monthly Statements set up on paper side for MM
    * cannot reuse eStatement Selective Inserts data file since it is
      * Symitar format
      * the data file was used for Monthly Visa application of 'Demo' which is not MM enabled.
    * Monthly Statements uses OSI core data file
    * Tien to verify index file once we finish resolving bugs and give a go.  
<notice> BC: what does it take to create a data file that can work with 'DEMO'
w/ 'MM' then? </notice>  
 _Bhavani: Tien has created data file and also a spreadsheet with contents of
some fields that can be used for criteria. Added to the end of this page_

  2. When MM3.0 is turned on for 'Demo' client on Pilot, what happens to MM2.x (existing) campaigns?  
<notice> BC: all MM2.2 campaigns are expected to be ended before MM3.0
campaigns can kick-in </notice>  
 _Bhavani: To be communicated to AS; added to table below_

  3. Is Raja preparing a presentation similar to eStatement Selective Inserts for the group?  
<notice> BC: I'll run through the application mainly, no presentation, but
will provide developers access to pilot to play with it </notice>  
 _Bhavani: done :)_

  4. Bhavani will come up with the parallel testing document.

##  Inform all departments during parallel run

 **TaskID**|  **Date/Time**|  **Owner**|  **TODO**  
---|---|---|---  
10| TBD| AS| All MM2.x campaigns are expected to be ended before client moves
to MM3.0  
20| TBD| IS| Message Area coordinates to be provided by IS, after composition
on Papyrus. This helps an approximate definition of the end-user's view on
InfoTRAC. The better the approximation, the better the end-user feels while
setting up the campaign. This is a part of the existing MM2.x flow and has not
been changed in MM3.0. <notice>BC: is paper team going to reuse the existing
DEMO Monthly as-is? </notice>  _Bhavani: ref. Parallel Test Planning worksheet
added below; roles and responsibilities have been defined and communicated_  
30| TBD| IS| Marketing Link coordinates should match EXACTLY to the Message
Area coordinates. Again, this is a part of the existing MM2.x flow and has not
been changed in MM3.0.  
40| TBD| IS| validate when Marketing Link is unchecked, there are  _no
eStatement images_ ; only Paper statement images.  
50| TBD| IS| Criteria for both message areas to be the same. Ensure  _only and
all_  criteria for the client's application are checked during Feature Setup
for  _all_  message areas. Everything about a criteria must match across both
message areas - for e.g., if Account No. is defined as "File" for Message Area
1, it must be defined exactly the same for Message Area 2. Again, this is a
part of the existing MM2.x flow and has not been changed in MM3.0. <notice>BC:
who will come up with the actual criteria details? or maybe even template
creation? I assume AS will need to provide some kind of simulated campaign,
and use the MM3.0 pretending them are the clients? </notice>  _Bhavani: ref.
Parallel Test Planning worksheet added below; roles and responsibilities have
been defined and communicated_  
60| TBD| IS| To take advantage of the full range of features that are possible
for text messages, it is necessary to configure message area as an image and
use overlay text on a blank image. For minimal capabilities, message area can
be configured as a text area. No all features of the text area message (font,
style) may be reflected on paper if it is a text area since Papyrus
programming is pending for those. This could potentially mean we need to
charge the 'Text' message content with same rate as the 'Graphics' message
content. To-be-discussed with AS/Sales  
70| TBD| IS| During feature setup, it is our internal responsibility to ensure
that the sample (background) statement is a PDF.  
  
|  
|  
| <notice>BC: how about the review and approval, and laser
prints...etc?</notice>  _Bhavani: ref. Parallel Test Planning worksheet added
below; roles and responsibilities have been defined and communicated_
