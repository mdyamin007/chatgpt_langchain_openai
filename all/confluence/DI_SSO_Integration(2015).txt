  1. IFSIBhblogin.jsp (validate the user information(optional: (create accounts) and (map the user-account relationships)). once validated, return the key)  
Required Params below:

    1. user_fi_number (For model that requires account type, it'll be used as "cifNum". The model without account type will be used as "acctNum".)

        1. account_number(i) (i is an increment number goes from 1)
          1. if found, loop until not found and use params below:  
i. anum(i) acctNum  
ii. astat(i) not being used  
iii. atype(i) acctType  
iv. ausr(i) not being used

          2. if not found, error out
        2. else use param below:
          1. anum acctNum
          2. astat not being used

# DI SSO on HyperCube

  
  

## Version 1 : Account number received as part of
user_fi_number[](https://i3dev.easyredmine.com/projects/estmt20/wiki/DISSOIntegration#Version-1-Account-
number-received-as-part-of-user_fi_number)

  1. /ssoKeygen (Server route that get the parameters, validates them (optional: (create accounts) and (map the user-account relationships)) and if valid, return the key)

  
  

#### Reads the following parameters :

  1. user_fi_number (Used as account number)
  2. pswd (Password to validate the sso method with the password saved for each cid in property file)
  3. email (Email address)

  
  

#### Accounts creation/User-Accounts mapping

In this model, parameters external Id and list of accounts will have the same
value: user_fi_number (account number). Additionally an optional parameter
(controlled by property) is also sent to check if the account number has to be
created if it is not present already. If account_number is null and
autoCreateAccount=y then anum=user_fi_number  
  

## Version 2 : External user id received as part of user_fi_number and
account_num received
independently[](https://i3dev.easyredmine.com/projects/estmt20/wiki/DISSOIntegration#Version-2-External-
user-id-received-as-part-of-user_fi_number-and-account_num-received-
independently)

  1. /ssoKeygen (Server route that get the parameters, validates them (optional: (create accounts) and (map the user-account relationships)) and if valid, return the key)

  
  

#### Reads the following parameters :

  1. user_fi_number (Used as cifNum/external user id)
  2. pswd (Password to validate the sso method with the password saved for each cid in property file)
  3. email (Email address)
  4. if(account_number is present) {  
account_number (Account number)  
atype (Account type)  
} else {  
account_number(i) (i is an increment number goes from 1) (if found, loop
through each index for following parameters)

atype(i) (Account type associated with each account number)  
}  
//AS of now astat,ausr,adsc are parameters which are not being processed on
hypercube SSO processing time. atype is processed as per the index of the
sequence of parameters for account_num

  
  

#### Accounts creation/User-Accounts mapping

In this model, parameters external Id will get the value from user_fi_number
and list of accounts will get the value from account_number/account_number(i).
Additionally an optional parameter (controlled by property) is also sent to
check if the account number has to be created if it is not present already.
