title: Different ways of looping through Object in jQuery
body:   * jQuery.each($(this), function() {  
alert($(this).val());  
})  
This way is to call the global jQuery to loop through the Object.
Theoretically, it's slower than the option as it will need to find the Object,
$(this), out of all the elements then loop through the result sets.

  * $(this).each(function() {  
alert($(this).val());  
})  
This way is to obtain the object first, then loop through it. Theoretically is
faster than method one.
