## Goals

  * Add new Enotice code 300 for SSCU
  * Enhance SSCU to use doc_desc table

## Background and strategic fit

Enhancing SSCU to use doc_desc table will facilitate future addition of
eNotice codes for SSCU. In the eventual case that we migrate SSCU over to
Hypercube, we would already have the doc_desc table up-to-date.

## Assumptions

  * IS will post the new eNotice with letter code 300
  * SscuENoticeDesc is only used for eNotice description purposes

## Requirements
