# July 5

  * Preview selected components

# August 2

  * Demo with full functionality, excluding banner, newsletter, contextual search, and normal search/filter.
    1. Sprint 5: Dashboard, SsoKeyGen Frontend, ssoExchange Frontend
    2. Sprint 6: Left Side Menu, Profile, Statement List
    3. Sprint 7: SSO, DSO, Enrollment Process
    4. Sprint 8: Popup Alert, Batch Download

By the end of this, QA should be able to start QA on select few clients who
can be set up fully. This would mean that InfoConfig must also be updated
accordingly to have all the configurations.

# September 6

  * Banner, Contextual Search, and normal search/filter. Site should be fully functional.
    1. Sprint 9: Search and Filter, Contextual Search
    2. Sprint 10:  Implement all SSO methods (if not already implemented)
    3. Sprint 11:
    4. Sprint 12:

  

# Deferred for Later

  * Episys SSO: implementation in current Hypercube code is incorrect
  * FIS SSO: no cid is currently using this
  * NT_HBLOGIN SSO: bbbb is using this, but not on Hypercube yet. Uncertain whether the implementation is correct.

# Banner

  * New fixed positions
  * Different configurations for Web vs Mobile
  * New InfoTRAC module or expand existing?

  
| Pros| Cons  
---|---|---  
New|

    * We are already planning to update all the InfoTRAC modules
    * Hypercube 2 would use distinct positions different from Hypercube
|

    * New module to develop  
Expand|

    * Existing module
|

    * Tool might be confusing since some configurations would be Hypercube only and some would be Hypercube 2 only (we might be able to toggle these with a configuration)
    * We might need to update Hypercube 2 later to work with the new module when we eventually do that upgrade.  
  
  

# Newsletter

  * New InfoTRAC module
