  *  _By Request and Autopayments makes use of the CIM module._  When in live mode in production when you add a credit card and profile is created at and saved a authorize's end. This also involves a test transaction of status voided get created on authorize end for an amount of 0 dollars. If you click on this transaction the description would mention something like "test transaction for ValidateCustomerPaymentProfile"  
Exp for this from authorizes site is given below.  
 **ValidateCustomerPaymentProfile**  
This method is used to check a customer payment profile by generating a test
transaction for it. The merchant must be signed up for the CIM service to use
it.  
During creation of the payment profile from within the Merchant Interface, if
"Perform credit card authorization before saving data." is not checked , then
a $1.00 Test Mode transaction will be submitted to verify that the credit
information is in a valid format. This Test Mode transaction does not show on
the customer's credit card statement, but it will generate a transaction
receipt e-mail to the merchant. The test transaction will only verify that the
credit card information is in the correct format--it will not verify that it
is a valid card. To verify the card, you must check the box next to "Perform
credit card authorization before saving data."
