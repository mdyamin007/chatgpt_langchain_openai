## Step-by-step guide

  * Login to the PUI site and navigate to the Resource Upload tab at the top left under EPJS.

  * Click 'Next' and you should see a description of the files inside the zip folder in addition to who uploaded the latest file (This will be blank if it is a completely new file):

 **Identical Files:**

By default, the Action is set to None because the exact file already exists.
If these need to be replaced anyway, click on Replace for each file before
clicking on Upload.

  

 **Non-matching files:**
