## sql level issues

Sql embedded in application and stored procedures will need to be rewritten,
as they were optimized for oracle and sql syntax are different. For example  
any queries wihch use rowid/longs/clob/blob for oracle will have to be re-
written. Any queries which use oracle data analytic functions will have to be  
rewritten as these do not exist in mysql. In case of complex queries, mysql is
still relatively poor at subqueries, so some Subqueries may need to be  
rewritten as Joins or broken up into smaller queries. Also some query features
are not available in mysql, such as recursive query, sequences,  
synonyms, db link etc. But there are not show stoppers and just require work
arounds. Mysql also processes string collation differently - default is

Case insensitive. Mysql locking during dml queries is also different, but
these differences can be managed.  
There are also many syntax differences in sql function calls such as
decode/instr/nvl/sysdate etc , but this is relatively a minor issues.  
  

## stored procedure level issues

Store procedure language Syntax are not compatible between oracle PLSQL and
mysql, and in addition, many PLSQL features are not available in mysql. So  
stored procedures will need to be translated using automated tools and then
manually edited/rewritten/tested. Some routines will need to be totally  
rewritten as mysql not supporting in/out ref cursors and no error trapping, no
packages etc. In some Cases it might make more sense to move stored  
procedure functionality To application side by rewriting it as java code which
is considerably more feature rich than mysql stored procedure code. In  
addition, all application Calls to stored procedures will need to be
rewritten.  
  

## data and database level issues

Oracle and mysql have Very different performance profiles - oracle is better
and faster at complex queries but mysql (meaning INNODB) excels at  
processing simpler queries and transactions - (by order of magnitude either
way and vice versa). This means that in Some Cases transactions processing  
logic need to be rewritten.

Oracle has flashback query capabiIity, but this is missing in mysql. Flashback
queries are very useful for recovering from human errors on production  
database. Without such ability, recovery of accidently lost data will be more
complex and time consuming, such as rolling forward a lagging slave or  
restoring old backup.

There are also other missing database features such as materialized view.
These will have to be substituted with summary table which is refreshed by  
stored procedure.

Data types are mostly compatible between oracle and mysql, but there are
issues with some data types, such as rowid which does not exist in mysql.  
  

## replication issues from oracle to mysql

Since entire database cannot be transferred at once during any reasonable
switchover time, it's better to establish workable replication between oracle  
to mysql which will allow mysql copy to keep up with oracle. There is product
called tungsten replicator, but this uses CDC (change data capture)  
feature of oracle, but CDC does not suppport blob/clob/long data types. So
this makes tungsten useless for replicaion of database which uses clobs and  
blobs, and custom process will need to be set up which will keep oracle
production db and mysql copy in sync after bulk transfer of data.
