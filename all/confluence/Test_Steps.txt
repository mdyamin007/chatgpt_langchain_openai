title: Test Steps
body: Step 0: Clear eStatements website for 'Demo' client of all estatements. UNDO
PUIs as necessary

Step 1: Set up Message Campaign in InfoTrac

  1. Create Message Campaign
  2. Approve Message Campaign
  3. Verify index file exists on \\\10.8.8.216\input\I3\MsgSample\demo\txt
  4. Verify that the servlet on InfoTRAC works
    * Access [http://10.8.8.212:9090/MsgServlet22?cid=demo&apptype=ms1&cycledate=08272013](http://10.8.8.212:9090/MsgServlet22?cid=demo&apptype=ms1&cycledate=08272013) (08272013 is the processing date for the campaign; substitute appropriately, substituted date must lie within the campaign dates. Substitute environment IP for Pilot if testing on Pilot)
    * The response must look something like this - 1|\\\\\\\10.8.8.216\\\input\\\I3\\\demo\\\demo_ms1_08202013_08312013.zip. (the zip will have the campaign dates)

Step 2: Set up IS processing files.

  1. Data file is demoms1_osi.dat. A backup of this file exists at /d/ftpbu/demobu/test. DO NOT use the backup.
    * cp /d/ftpbu/demobu/test/demoms1_osi.dat /d/ftpbu/demobu
    * Edit Statement Date in data file. Ensure it is a "new" date; and doesn't match any on the eStatements web site so far.
  2. Remove checksum.
    * vi /home/keep/cksum_log/demoms1_cksum.log
    * Delete all lines (Ctrl-dd)
  3. Update insert information and enter selection criteria
    * /home/insert/demoms1.ins
    * PROC_DATE to match date of processing. This should lie within the boundaries of the campaign scheduled dates in InfoTRAC.
  4. Return to home directory. Temp files generated during processing are better saved here than in other directories.
    * cd
  5. Execute Paper Processing Script - /home/master/isis.sh
    * Choose in the interactive menu:
      * 's' - for Statements
      * 170 - ID for 'DEMO' client
      * 2 - for 'Statement' application
      * Path for data file - /d/ftpbu/demobu/demoms1_osi.dat
  6. demoms1_osi.dat would have moved out of /d/ftpbu/demobu. So, copy it again from /d/ftpbu/demobu/test
    * cp /d/ftpbu/demobu/test/demoms1_osi.dat /d/ftpbu/demobu
    * Edit Statement Date in data file. Ensure it matches the 's' option date that was edited above.
  7. Get back to home directory.
    * cd
  8. Execute eStatements Processing Script - /home/master/isis.sh
    * Choose in the interactive menu:
      * 'f' - for AFP to PDF
      * rest are the same as for 's' option above

Step 3: PUI

  1. Login to PUI (System A: <http://10.8.8.221:9090/login.jsp>)
  2. Every PUI processing will add one more eStatement to the accounts since the data file is the same. This can be confusing on the UI; so always UNDO earlier PUI first.
  3. Choose 'New Job', Client - 'Demo'
  4. AFP Processing - Browse and input the latest index file. The index file (looks like ms1_05312013_08272013_1439_demo.txt)generated at the end of IS Processing would be dropped in 10.8.8.216/input - the PUI input directory
  5. Ensure "Parallel" is checked
  6. Ignore the rest of the steps ("Skip") and start PUI.
  7. Check for no. of "Good" entries; must match the no. of records in the data file.
  8. Log Check
    * Read log and verify that message ids are being pulled from InfoTRAC
    * Read log to verify mode='test' and not 'prod'

Step 4: eStatements Member Site - Selective Insert Visibility

  1. Open eStatements - <https://10.8.8.221:9389/login.jsp>
  2. Login
    * Use account number as required for test case with password 'demo'
    * If account number is not registered for eStatments, do so - register with email id of self.
    * Click on Statement
    * Verify
  3. Logout
    * click on 'Exit'
