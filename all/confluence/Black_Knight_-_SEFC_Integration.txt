title: Black Knight - SEFC Integration
body: # Current Workflow

Data contains BK Number -> Cross-reference File -> DNA Number -> Post to
Electronic.

For SSO, the vendor might send more accounts than we should display. A PS_ALL
file is processed to determine the accounts that should be visible.

# Phase 1 - Live July 1st

Users access with SSO via Alkami/Bottomline.

 **Conflicts with Standard Setup:**

  1. Print will post to DNA Number with NA account type.

This will still align with how SSO work currently. Everything will work as
normal for Alkami and Bottomline.

# Phase 2 - Live TBD

BKI API will need to be available.

 **Changes to make** :

  1. Cross reference will be removed. Print will post to BK Number.
  2. One-time remapping of all DNA account to BK account with type BK.
  3. BK will send an enrollment file to update enrollment information.

 **Conflict** :

  1. Alkami SSO
    1. It is possible for Alkami to send the BK number. 
    2. Still need to use the PS_ALL file to filter down the account lists.
  2. Bottomline SSO
    1. As of right now, it seems like Bottomline cannot send the BK number. They would still only send the DNA number.
  3. Even if we can use all BK numbers, the PS_ALL comes from Fiserv, so the mappings can't map to BK numbers.

  

## Potential Solution 1 - Double Posting

Post all the statements to both an NA account and a BK account. The NA
accounts will be used for SSO. The BK accounts will be used exclusively by
Black Knight.

This is for the case where Alkami and Bottomline cannot make the necessary
changes to support the new system. The client wants us to plan for this
possibility.

 **Issues to Resolve** :

  1. Volume will double for posting.
    1. Since we are going to reuse the afp/pdf, maybe we can set up a contract to not double the client's bill, which is not something the client would want to do.
  2. Paperless Status.
    1. Enrollment file from BK would update the NA accounts.
    2. BK Accounts would  **never** have their paperless information changed.

## Potential Solution 2

This is an idea by the client.

  1. Alkami will change to using API.
  2. Bottomline would be the only SSO left with a small number of users (about 70).

 **Conflict** :

  1. Uncertain whether Alkami can request only the statement-holding accounts in the API request.
  2. Still need a solution on how Bottomline SSO can still remain working.

## Potential Solution 3

Mapping from the Black Knight API side: BK Number -> DNA Number.

 **Conflict** :

  1. This is a unique logic that we might not want to have support for at the API level.
