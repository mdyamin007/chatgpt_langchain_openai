    Virtual memoryedit
    Elasticsearch uses a hybrid mmapfs / niofs directory by default to store its indices. The default operating system limits on mmap counts is likely to be too low, which may result in out of memory exceptions.
    On Linux, you can increase the limits by running the following command as root:
    sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
    To set this value permanently, update the vm.max_map_count setting in /etc/sysctl.conf. To verify after rebooting, run sysctl vm.max_map_count.
    The RPM and Debian packages will configure this setting automatically. No further configuration is required.

    Elasticsearch has attempted to install a system call filter since version 2.1.0. On some systems, installing this system call filter could fail. Previous versions of Elasticsearch would log a warning, 
    but would otherwise continue executing potentially leaving the end-user unaware of this situation. Starting in Elasticsearch 5.2.0, there is now a bootstrap check for success of installing the system call filter. If you encounter an issue starting Elasticsearch due to this bootstrap check, you need to either fix your configuration so that the system call filter can be installed, or at your own
    risk disable the
