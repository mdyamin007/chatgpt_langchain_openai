title: Level 3 SOP
body: Please follow these procedures when dealing with a level 3 ticket (highets
priority).

Constant communication is key here. Always keep the ticket updated at least
every few hours with an update, even if it's something as simple as "Looking
into it".

  

Level 3 Definition:

  * Global system down
  *  **Entire  **customer/member is not able to log in
  * Cross-site contamination (customers seeing other customer's information on the site)
  * Personal Information Breach

Not a Level 3:

  *  **One** or **Some** member not able to log in
  * General Inquiries (Ex. Password resets)

  

  1. Acknowledge the ticket so that internal teams will know that you are looking into it.
  2. Read through the ticket. Is there enough information to go off? If not, Assign the ticket to the AC/AM and ask for clarifying information. 
  3. Determine if it's a true level 3. Consult the list above. If not, state the reason why not and ask the AC/AM to downgrade.
  4. Prioritize the research, but keep the ticket updated with your latest status. If you are too busy to do so, ask a manager or lead to help facilitate the communication with internal staff.
  5. Once completed, prepare your findings for a debriefing with the internal teams in preparation for the client-facing call.
  6. Do a post-incident review and prepare RCA as necessary.
