  1. MySQL Version?? 5.6.19

## Migrate Data from Oracle to MySQL

  

### What Tool/Utility/Script is used?

    
    
    Mysql migration toolkit was used to move data from Oracle to Mysql.  
       This is not the current "mysql workbench" toolkit produced by oracle, but previous version of  
       mysql toolkit which was created when mysql was owned by Sun.
    
    
    Current "mysql workbench" only offer ability to migrate from mysql to oracle but not vice versa as  
       Oracle eliminated that capability in this toolkit.
    
    
    Older version allows migration from Oracle to Mysql, but it is incompletely developed tool, and  
       offer no ability to automatically migrate any stored procedure/function/triggers
    
    
    In addition this tool has defect in that when it performs online transfer of data, it   
        attempts to do it in single transaction, which will always fail if the table is larger than   
        moderate size (few 100K rows).  
        But it offers ability to dump oracle data in mysql friendly format, and this can be used to import   
        large tables from oracle to mysql.
    
    
    Another way to migrate data from oracle to mysql is to use oracle gateway (dg4odbc) which allows   
         data to be pushed from oracle to mysql.   This is useful for creating real time replication from   
         oracle to mysql.
    
    
    Another way to move data from oracle to mysql is to create java program which uses jdbc to copy data from   
          oracle to mysql.  This is more or less what Mysql migration toolkit already does, but script would be  
          more flexible.

  

### How to Setup the XtraDB cluster?

  1. Need to put configuration values/details
  2. installation steps

Installation of percona xtradb cluster is straightforward:

1) configure percona apt repository:  
a) $ apt-key adv --keyserver [keys.gnupg.net](http://keys.gnupg.net) \--recv-
keys 1C4CBDCDCD2EFD2A

    
    
    b) Add this to /etc/apt/sources.list

  1. VERSION is version of ubuntu, like "lucid" ############  
deb <http://repo.percona.com/apt> VERSION main  
deb-src <http://repo.percona.com/apt> VERSION main  
Remember to update the local cache:

c) apt-get update

2) install xtradb cluster

    
    
    a) $ sudo apt-get install percona-xtradb-cluster-56

  1. tool/util execution steps

  

## Stored Procedures Migration

  

### Laundry list of all stored procedures/triggers involved that need to be
migrated

  * [I3 eStmt Stored Procedures and Triggers](https://i3dev.easyredmine.com/projects/relmgmt/wiki/I3_eStmt_Stored_Procedures_and_Triggers)
  * [InfoTRAC Stored Procedures and Triggers](https://i3dev.easyredmine.com/projects/relmgmt/wiki/InfoTRAC_Stored_Procedures_and_Triggers)
  * [DataTrac Stored Procedures and Triggers](https://i3dev.easyredmine.com/projects/relmgmt/wiki/DataTrac_Stored_Procedures_and_Triggers)

  
  

### Any tool used for such migration? If no, what's the general rules that we
follow to convert them?

There are number of commercial stored procedure conversion tools. But there
are no open source/free tools that I am aware of. I am not sure how good these
commercial tools are. There are many oracle stored procedure
features/functions/syntax for which there are no mysql equivalent, so there
can be no conversion tool which can do 100% automated conversion.

## Backup/DR strategy

  1. full backup? Or replication across datacenter?

Full backup can be created using percona xtrabackup.  
Because backup process can put load on the production server,  
it's advisable to create a slave from the xtradbcluster and  
take backup using the slave.  
Slave is also useful for executing reporting queries/ long running jobs  
  

## Source Control of Schema Definition & Stored Procedures

  

### How to do source control over all of the details in database, including
full-ddl, delta-ddl for upgrades, schema-upgrade-data-migration, stored
procedures,
etc.[](https://i3dev.easyredmine.com/projects/relmgmt/wiki/Ora2my_xtradb_poc#How-
to-do-source-control-over-all-of-the-details-in-database-including-full-ddl-
delta-ddl-for-upgrades-schema-upgrade-data-migration-stored-procedures-etc)

For mysql, full schema ddl can be generated using mysqldump with --no-data
option.  
dump can include all triggers/events/stored procedures using --events
--routines --triggers options  
  

## Q&A

  1. We have separated into 3 schemas (i.e. CU, Bank, Default) mainly due to (1) large volume of records, (2) schema usage different between CU and Bank. Do we still need such break-down in the Xtradb Cluster setup?
    1. Yes it's good to plan for future sharding (due to growing traffic/data), and being able to split database on functional lines easily. Even if all three schemas will run adequately on single server, xtradb cluster does  
not load balance write load, as all write loads go to all members of cluster.
Therefore, if write load becomes  
too high, it will be necessary to create separate clusters housing each of I3,
I3_CU and I3_BANK
