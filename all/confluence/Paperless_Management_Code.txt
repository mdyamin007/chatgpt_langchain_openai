## Paperless Update Reason

The paperless_reason table has: P_ID, REASON_ID, DETAIL, and
PAPERLESS_REASON_ID.  There is no need for this.

A better design is to have only PAPERLESS_REASON_ID and DETAIL. The REASON
field inside the paperless table should be a Foreign Key to the
PAPERLESS_REASON_ID. Since all reason code should have the same detail, we
should not store a record for every paperless record, but instead store a
single reason record that can be linked using the PAPERLESS_REASON_ID primary
key.

We should start using the reason code everywhere we can to provide more
clarity as to the reason/location of why the update was made.

## Add Reason to Paperless2 Table

The REASON column does not exist in the paperless2 table. We should add this
also. This is something that exists in the paperless table, and should be
reflected in paperless2 for easy joining and research. Some queries are not
possible without this, e.g. all accounts that were updated due to a certain
reason (latest update only). Technically, we can join with paperless, but the
complex query may take up too much temp space for the database to handle.
