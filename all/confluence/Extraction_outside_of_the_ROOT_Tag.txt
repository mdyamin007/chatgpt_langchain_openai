title: Extraction outside of the ROOT Tag
body: ## **Problem:**

By default, xml2bar works with one 'root' tag at a time. So usually it can't
extract a tag outside of that root tag.

In the following examples, the root tag = "envelope".

But we want to extract them and put them only one time, at the beginning of
the bar delimited file.

  

So Assume our XML document look like this,

xmlConfluence1true

  

If you specify a template like this

jsConfluence1true

It won't work, even though the logic and the syntax are correct.

## Solutions

### Solution 1

Specify your tags like this:

jsConfluence1true

 **Note:** This should work but this does not support **`XPath`** expression.
Also, this will cause the XML file to be read two times.` `
