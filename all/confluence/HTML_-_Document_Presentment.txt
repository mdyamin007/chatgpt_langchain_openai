## Goals

  * Turn ordinary customer documents into powerful communications tools.
  * Deliver consistent information across multiple platforms
  * Introduce a "new" statement presentment option for our customer base
  * Provide a better on-screen appearance than PDFs

## Background and strategic fit

The reason behind adding this product to InfoIMAGE's product line is to add
another form of document presentment to our clients. With this addition to the
suite, our clients will be able to view their documents in HTML format,
providing for a more friendly output of their statements. This addition will
also allow for true ADA compliance for our clients when presenting statements
in HTML format.

This addition will allow for InfoIMAGE to expand their product line from only
PDF presentment to HTML presentment as well.

## Assumptions

  * Financial Institutions will push this to customers/members
  * Financial Institutions will push this to a multiple array of devices - Desktop, Laptop, Tablets, Mobile Phones
  * Financial Institutions will want this to be able to be read by ADA readers
  * Financial Institutions will want more features to add to this product in the future i.e. video, targeted ads, check links, etc.
