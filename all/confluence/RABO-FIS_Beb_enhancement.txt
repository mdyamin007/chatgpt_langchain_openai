title: RABO-FIS Beb enhancement
body: RABO BebCeb enhancments  
For CeB:  
1\. Identify CeB by looking at the BankIdentifier in SSO payload. It'd be
empty/field-absent  
2\. XML payload come from FIS  
3\. Prism simply passthrough to Hypercube FISSSO adaptor  
4\. Hypercube FISSSO adaptor will do a dumb ssokeygen by encryption and
returned key  
5\. Upon ssoexchange, Hypercube FISSSO will validate against mongo record  
6\. If valid, call infoservice with CIF Number (regular CIF number) to
validate if this is a real user. DO NOT create user if not exist  
7\. Account List is normally empty, but even if populated, since we don't
update UFA, no effect.  
8\. No UFA update expected.  
9\. An 'Admin' flag is absent/empty in the SSO payload that need to be
passthrough as part of response below.  
10\. Return internal User ID upon all success prior steps.

For BeB:  
1\. Identify BeB by looking at the BankIdentifier in SSO payload. It'd be
populated  
2\. XML payload come from FIS  
3\. Prism simply passthrough to Hypercube FISSSO adaptor  
4\. Hypercube FISSSO adaptor will do a dumb ssokeygen by encryption and
returned key  
5\. Upon ssoexchange, Hypercube FISSSO will validate against mongo record  
6\. If valid, call infoservice with CIF Number (arbitrary user identifier that
FIS assign, expecting FIS to prefix it with BeB to avoid CIF Number conflict
with CeB CIF Numbers) to validate if this is a real user. AUTO create user if
not exist.  
7\. Account List is expected to be populated. If Account List is empty, fail
the SSO request  
8\. UFA records need to be updated.  
9\. An 'Admin' flag is present (with value = 'A' or 'R') in the SSO payload
that need to be passthrough as part of response below.  
10\. Return internal User ID and Admin Flag upon all success prior steps.  
11\. Prism will update the USR.TYPE with value from 'Admin' flag (of
successful ssoExchange response).

Assumptions: Applicable to Both BeB and CeB  
1\. If <BankIdentifier>ABC_Business( orBebxxx123)<BankIdentifier> field is
missing or has no value, consider it as CeB user and process normally as
before and return the internal userId for CIF ({"userId":18366196}).  
2\. If <BankIdentifier>ABC_Business( orBebxxx123)<BankIdentifier> is present
and the list of <Account> is empty, return it as an invalid request, else
create mapping in UFA and create user/account if not present. On success,
return the internal user id and the usertype from the sso request
({"userId":18366197,"userType":"regular"}).
