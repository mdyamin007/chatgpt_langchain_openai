title: Epayment status - state flow diagram
body: From Alok,

1 - Pending and scheduled payment is that status just before the payment is
submitted to EPX.  
2- Submitted is that status after the payment is submitted to EPX.  
3 - Processing is that status when EPX submits the payments to the Issuer card
company (in case of card payments) or to ACH bank ( in case of ACH payments)  
NOTE - 2 & 3 happen instantly in case of most Credit card and debit card
payments.  
4 - Completed status for both Credit card transaction completes during CCE1
transactions or can happen directly from 1 to 4 transition when settlement
report gets processed and when the transaction response was not received from
EPX.  
5 - This can happen either directly when from 1 to 5 when EPX request response
was not received when a transaction was submitted and then we receive in
settlement report or the transaction is declined directly when submitting the
request.  
Declined should be used for card requests submitted.  
Failed should be used for requests in case of failures for any other reasons
like API connection failed but you may still want to show the transactions in
the transaction history.

6 - will come for transactions that were completed but refund/returns were
issued by EPX to the issuer card/ACH pay from account.  

From Ben,

Amjad & Rohit,

We had some discussion around this. The only change I would like to make is
the 'Scheduled' should be it's own status. Different from 'Pending'.

Thanks.
