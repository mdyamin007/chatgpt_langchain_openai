# Auth File Processing

* * *

HTBK's auth file processing is set up to maintain only the primary account
relationships. For business users who have sub-users, the sub-users are
maintained only through SSO.

## SSO

Retail users log into SSO via NCR (DI). Business users log into SSO via BB.

### Business Rule

Primary users who have logged in via SSO will not be removed in the post-
process even if the account relationships are removed from the auth file.

#### Technical Implications

  1. Users who logged in via SSO will have the UFA.source set to SSO. These users will now be referenced as SSO Users.
  2. Auth files will ignore UFAs with UFA.source == SSO. 
  3. SSO Users can only be removed through the Delete User function on the Admin Site.
    1. Primary SSO Users will be reverted to having UFA.source == DSO, allowing the Auth file to remove the corresponding account relationships if they are no longer in the Auth file
    2. Business Sub-users will be removed 

# Admin Site

## Admin Roles

There are 4 roles:

  * Admin Guest - Only has access to Account Management (except Unenroll and Delete User buttons) and view-only Administration tabs.
  * Admin User - Mostly has access to everything except the Email Reminder tab and can only update Admin Guest user profiles.
  * Manager - Mostly has access to everything except the Email Reminder tab and cannot update the Superuser nor other Manager user profiles.
  * Superuser - Access to everything, particularly the Email Reminder tab and ability to update all admin user profiles.

## Unenroll SSO Feature

Users who have logged into eStatement via SSO will have the  **Unenroll SSO
**button enabled.

When a user is unenrolled, the following will occur:

  1. SSO Date and SSO Key are set to null.
  2. Every linked account is checked to see if there are other enrolled users.   

    1. For each account, if there are no enrolled users, the account is switched back to Paper if it is not already on Paper.

## Delete User Feature

Users who have logged into eStatement and have a User Profile (USR_SESSION)
will have the  **Delete**   **User** button enabled.

When a user is deleted, the following will occur:

  1. Sub-users will be completely removed. 
    1. USR_SESSION is deactivated.
    2. SSO date and SSO key are set to null.
    3. All UFAs are removed.
    4. Parent-child relationship is removed from USR_TREE.
    5. Sub-user CIF is removed from USR_MAPPING.
  2. Primary users are only deactivated.
    1. USR_SESSION is deactivated.
    2. SSO date and SSO key are set to null.
    3. Every linked account is checked to see if there are other enrolled users.
      1. For each account, if there are no enrolled users, the account is switched back to Paper if it is not already on Paper.
    4. UFA.source set to DSO to enable Auth file removal
