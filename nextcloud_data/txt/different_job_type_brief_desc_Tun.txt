Different job types brief description of Papyrus by Tun:

Hi Tun,
 
Thanks for your feedback. Please send us your updated dfa file. We want to know how you put the '&JOB_TYPE' logic and want to store it for future use.
 
Sure. Please review the new project in “/d/infoftps3/Vend_DSI/client_pickup/print_process/AMAC/AMACLN21.zip”. Make sure you use the data file in the project. The sample data file has 0700 record that we mentioned before. 0700 record comes from cross reference file for CIF#.
 
 
One other thing is if you have enough time please describe about the 'JOB_TYPE' logic. How will we know what 'JOB_TYPE' logic should we implement? I went through the SOW several times but i couldn't understand where to look and what to find. 
 
Basically 'JOB_TYPE' is our internal name to distinguish process.
Example,
JOB_TYPE = ‘s’ mean for paper process. We use final afp files (print files) to mail out physically.
JOB_TYPE = ‘f’ mean for e-statement/e-notices process.  We use final afp files to post online.
JOB_TYPE = ‘e’ or ‘pdfi’ mean for archival process. We convert afp files to pdf files and send back to banks for future use.
 
So generally, the codes under JOB_TYPE = ‘e’ cover under “Archival;” section in SOW (look at SOW under “10. Archival”).  
 
REMEMBER: As Terrence explained before, you DO NOT need to remove the codes under “JOB_TYPE - IF conditions”. Just need to update the one we required in the SOW. Because the specific “JOB_TYPE - IF condition” will call when the processing script call the format dfa,.
 
 
We can not also understand which values we should use for group index and  their sequence. What is the affect of group index in papyrus? It would be great help if you describe about these.
 
Information in group index are used by the post archival script. Basically, The script is creating pdf index files with the information from the “Group index”. In this AMAC job, we need to create two index file “BillingStatement.xml” and “BillingStatementAccount.xml”. You can find the client(AMAC) requirements for those xml index files in SOW. Those information in xml tags are coming from your group index in papyrus.
