E-Statement project workflow:

Hi All,

I had a meeting with Nahid regarding the steps we follow in E-Statement team. We have decided to update the previous steps as followings and told everyone to strictly follow this steps. 


Step 1 : Requirement analysis and Dev Plan
      - Shahadet and Nahid will assign the task to the developer who will be working.
      - If the description on the redmine is not brief enough please let the initiator know during this 1st step.   
      - Once we get the requirement from Infoimage team we have to understand the requirement and make a dev plan document with the work flow along with the time required to develop. 
      Infoimage will provide a Due Date for us. Our task would be make sure if we can meet it. If we cannot we will notify them with the date explaining the reason on this spent time. 
      If any requirement is changed or any higher priority tasks is assigned we will notify in the redmine.

Step 2 : Test Plan
     -  If everything is positive about the dev plan and time estimation, The QA team will provide a test plan and the updated checklist.

(** The 'Time Spent' on the redmine should updated under Analysis for Step one and Step two)

Step 3 : Development
       - If there is any confusion regarding any part or if there is any existing bug we should notify the initiator through redmine. If you have a solution lets notify Infoimage anyhow so we are not in trouble afterwards. 
       - Once the development is done and testing is done from developer's end The assignee will change the assignee to Imran.
(** The 'Time Spent' on the redmine should updated under 'Development' for the above tasks and please notify me the progress by the end of the day and update the '% Done' section)
(** We have to finish development minimum two days before the demo for the QA team to test and make/update the test case document and the checklist and developers to resolve)


Step 4 : QA and Testing
        - Imran will test and make the test case doc and update the checklist over the client.
       - He will update the redmine attaching the documents and put a test summary in the note defining the bugs as Existing/New.
       - Once that is done reassign the developer to assignee.
(** The 'Time Spent' on the redmine should updated under 'QA' for the above tasks)
Step 3 and Step 4 will be repeated till the satisfactory level is achieved.

Step 5 : Demo
  - Please make sure to keep everything ready to give the demo through test server the day before the demo.
  - Every change given should be in redmine so the both teams stay on the same page.
  - If any change is given during the demo please make sure to follow the whole process from the step 1.

Some Notes:
  - The time estimated will include development and testing. The test docs and checklist should be provided before the demo. We should consider testing time for QA as well on how many clients he is working on.
  - If any change is a global change we should not be changing anything that would effect any other client.
  - QA should be thorough regardless of the changes. Test plan will be based on the requirement only but the test case and checklist will be the same for all clients, so we can keep track of the changes.
  - Every meeting should be recorded so we can make sure every single change is met and every thing that is said is on redmine.
Guys, we are working hard, All we need to follow the process to make more effective and successful deliveries. Make sure to follow the flow no matter how small the task is.
